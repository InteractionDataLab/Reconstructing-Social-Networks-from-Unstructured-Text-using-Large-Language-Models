Details
BBa_K358000 : Lac promoter with GFP
The lac promoter will be repressed and not induce GFP in the presence of lacI. We measured the strength of fluorescence with low copy plasmid vector, pSB4K5 .
BBa_K358001 : Measurement Standard
Constitutive promoter BBa_J23101 with GFP on low plasmid pSB4K5 .
BBa_K358004 : lambda lysis cassette[SRRz/Rz1]
This part causes cell death.  It contains Holin/Antiholin, Endolysin and Rz/Rz1 genes.
BBa_K358006 : lambda lysis cassette with terminator
λ lysis cassette BBa_K358004 with double terminator BBa_B0015 .
BBa_K358010 : anti-killer gene with GFP
It codes SΔTMD1 as the anti-killer gene, which is derived from λ phage DNA and against the lambda lysis cassette BBa_K358005 : the killer gene.
BBa_K358012 : SΔTMD1
S gene, which is derived from lambda phage DNA, contains holin and antiholin. These proteins have three transmembrane domains. This SΔTMD1, however, lacks one of those domains and works as the anti-killergene against the lysis cassette, killer gene.
BBa_K358013 : SΔTMD1 with terminator
SΔTMD1 with double terminator.
BBa_K358015 : pLac+anti-killer gene
The anti-killer gene with GFP BBa_K358010 is expressed under the control of lac promoter.
BBa_K358016 : pLac+anti-killer gene+pConst
pLac+anti-killergene+pConst.
BBa_K358017 : low promoter+anti-killer gene
Low constitutive promoter [J23105] and anti-killer gene BBa_K358010 .
BBa_K358018 : Low promoter+anti-killergene+lacP
Constitutive promoter BBa_J23105 + anti-killergene BBa_358010 + lactose promoter BBa_R0011 .
BBa_K358019 : lysis cassette regulated by lacP
Lysis cassette[SRRz] is regulated by lactose promoter. Activating lactose promoter and expressing SRRz gene, it causes the cell lysis.  So, lactose promoter must be repressed when transform this part.
To repress lactose promoter tightly, we constructed this part on low copy plasmid, pSB4K5, and transformed into KRX, not TOP10.  KRX has lacI in its genome and TOP10 hasn't (see genotype [1] , [2] ).
BBa_K358020 : Lysisbox
This part consists two module. Constantly expressed killer gene BBa_K358004 by low promoter and regulatory expressed anti-killer gene with GFP by lac promoter.
BBa_K358021 : Lysisbox -module2-
Anti-killergene is induced constitutively and killergene is regulated by lactose promoter.
BBa_K358022 : lacP + SΔTMD1RRz
TMD1 is deleted from lysis cassette [SRRz].
BBa_K358023 : Lysisbox ver.2
This part is the same to BBa_K358020[Lysisbox], except for its constitutive promoter[BBa_J23100]. So, this plasmid is able to induce the killer gene more than the plasmid contains BBa_K358020. This part also contains SΔTMD1, anti-killergene, regulated by lacP. When transform this part, you must induce the SΔTMD1 highly, do not repress lacP, so that the cell lysis will be prevented. This is a long part and a lactose operon was deleted sometimes unexpectedly in our experiments. We recomend you that it is better to set the cultural temperature at 30C and store this part as a plasmid, not a glycerole stock.
BBa_K358024 : Lysisbox -module2- ver2
This part is the same to BBa_K358021[Lysisbox -module2-], except for its constitutive promoter[BBa_J23101]. So, this part also induces constitutively SΔTMD1 gene, the anti-killer gene, and lambda lysis cassette[SRRz], the killer gene, is regulated by lacP. Since the lysis cassette is toxic to E.coli, you must repress the lacP when you transform it. Because of this, Top 10 isn't suitable, we used KRX. This is a long part and a lactose operon was sometimes deleted unexpectedly in our experiments. So, we find that to set the cultural temperature at 30C and store this part as a plasmid, not a glycerol stock, is the prefareble.
