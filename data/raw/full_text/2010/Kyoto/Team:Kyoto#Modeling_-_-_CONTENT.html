The result is shown below.
</P><P>We predicted two things. One is that A550 is measured as the steady state at 16h, 18h and 20h. The other is that the more IPTG is introduced, the more A550 in the steady state decreases and completely reached zero. In the result, as you see Fig.1, OD550 was measured as the steady state at 16h, 18h and 20h in every IPTG concentration. In addition, we observed that OD550 decreased in the range from 0mM to 0.05mM of IPTG concentration. However, OD550 observed was a fixed value, (about 0.3 of OD550) at 0.05mMof IPTG. And E.coli was not completely killed by holin even in 1.0mM of IPTG!
</P><P>You may consider that this result occurred because of the mutation of our biobrick part. However, we denied the hypothesis by proposing the model the mutation happens in the next section.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Mutation_model">Mutation model</SPAN></H4><P>In this section, we explain the mutation model. We assume that our part works correctly in the beginning, accumulates the mutations on the way and loses its original function. As the result, OD550 does not reach zero even in IPTG 1.0 mM which is high enough. If this result really occurred by the mutant factor, OD550 at 16h, 18h and 20h must increase like an exponential function. However, in our result, OD550 at 16h, 18h and 20h in every IPTG concentration are measured as the steady state. Therefore the mutation model is not suited. Then, we will propose several stochastic models below.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Stochastic_model">Stochastic model</SPAN></H4><P>We propose four stochastic models.
</P><P>1. First model is that the effect of endolysin for cell lysis is limited though the concentration of endolysin increases. We consider that when much endolysin is expressed, the size of holes made by holin restricts the transition rate of endolysin from cytosol to periplasm, where endolysin degrades peptidoglycan and makes cell lysis.
</P><P>2. Second model is that the expression of holin and endolysin is not enough to kill every cell entirely. In this model, we assume that some cells are weak to the cell lysis and other cells are tough to that. If this is true, some proportional cells survive and the other proportional cells are died constantly (Fig.2).
</P><P>3. Third model is that quantity of expressed holin and endolysin is different from cells respectively. We assume that every cell has the threshold of lysis. In any concentration of IPTG, some proportional cells survive and the other cells are killed because of the difference of expression. (Fig.3)

Fourth model is that the transcription of holin and endolysin decreases because a part of the population of cells comes to be dormancy state <SUP><A href="#RefM2-1">[1]</A></SUP><SUP><A href="#RefM2-2">[2]</A></SUP>. In any concentration of IPTG,  a part of population of cells is always dormancy state and survive.
</P><P>In the conclusion, it is not mutant but stochastic factor that brought this result. In addition, every four stochastic models can explain that OD550 was measured as the steady state at 16h, 18h and 20h and did not reach zero in every IPTG concentration.
