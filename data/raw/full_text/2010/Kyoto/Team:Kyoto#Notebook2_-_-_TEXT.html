Culture
We stopped overnight cultures at 11:10 and took out 30µL culture from each test tube, and added it to 3mL fresh medium which is same for overnight culture. They are grown at 37℃ from 11:10-14:10. After 3-hours culture, OD600 of each culture were measured. Because we found that the 3-hours culture of the sample KRX had not grown, we use the overnight culture of the sample KRX in later procedures. We took out 1mL medium from test tubes and put them into 1.5mL tubes and freeze them. The data is shown in table below.
Measure
We melt samples and centrifuge them at 14,000rpm, at 4℃, for 2min. Discard the supernatant and 150µL cel lysis reagent to each pellet. These pellets were dissolved by vortex for 2min and centrifuged for 2min. From each tubes, 100µL of the supernatant was took out and added to each well of the plate for the plate reader. 100µL cell lysis reagent was also added to them. We measured GFP fluorescence in each sample (Ex/Em = 485/535nm, 1sec). The data is shown in table below. We calculated the promoter activity and the results are shown in table below.

Make M9 Medium
M9 salts were added to 1l MilliQ and sterilized by autocrave. M9 medium was stored in a fridge.
Monday, August 23 By: Tasuku, Takuya O.
Make Supplemented M9 Medium
We tried to dissolve CaCl2 0.1M (final concentration) in 1l M9 medium, but we failed because CaCl2 was too much.
Tuesday, August 24 By: Tasuku, Takuya O.
Make Supplemented M9 Medium
M9 salts were added to 1l MilliQ and sterilized by autocrave. We changed amount of CaCl2 from 0.1M (final concentration) to 0.01mM (final concentration), and we could make supplemented M9 medium.
Overnight culture
The ML, i.e., E.coli KRX transformed with <partinfo>K358000</partinfo> was grown in the supplemented M9 medium including 1mM IPTG for a night (16h).
Wednesday, August 25 By: Tasuku, Takuya O.
Culture
OD600 of the overnight culture was measured. The overnight culture was diluted in fresh supplemented M9 medium including 7 different IPTG concentration and OD600 of each medium was measured every 4 hours. The samples to measure fluorescence of GFP were also collected.

The OD600 of medium including 0.07mM, 0.10mM, and 1mM IPTG were not measured at 4h, but at 6h.
Measurement at 16h and 20h was conducted the day after.
We found that the number of the cell was in steady state at 16h and after.
Overnight Culture
The MS, i.e., E.coli KRX transformed with <partinfo>I20260</partinfo> was grown in supplemented M9 medium including 1mM IPTG for a night for 16 hours.

Make the plate of E.coli C2
The E.coli competent cell, C2, was diluted to three different concentration, that is 10-3, 10-5, 10<sup-6</sup>. The 200µL of each culture was plated without antibiotics.
Monday, August 30 By: Tomonori, Tasuku

Because amounts of samples collected at 0h are very little and the data indicates that is not enough to measure OD600 and fluorescence of GFP correctoly, we decide to measure OD600 after 4 hours only. We calculated the promoter activity of the lactose promoter.

We did not calculate RPU from these data because GFP fluorescence at 3.5h was lower than that at 3h in most of the samples, and we couldn't calculate GFP synthesis rate. We think this is because GFP synthesized in overnight culture with IPTG 1mM had stayed more at 3h than 3.5h.

Back corrected We can't use the data of IPTG 0mM to calculate RPU because GFP fluorescence at 3.5h is lower than that at 3h. Also we can't use the data of ML-B 0.01mM IPTG and the data of MS-A of 0.03mM. Although GFP fluorescence of 0.1mM (20 September) at 3.5h is higher than that at 3h, OD600 is so low. Accordingly,  We can't use the data of 0.1mM (20 September).
