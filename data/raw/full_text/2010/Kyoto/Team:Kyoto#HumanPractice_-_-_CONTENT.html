Five Universities (including Kyoto) participated in this project.  
We Kyoto team led other teams in the project, and successfully got <B>over 1,500 answers</B> in total!  From the survey, we found that opinions differ between students and non-students.  
To our little surprise, the survey also showed that the majority of Japanese regard biotechnology favorably, while at the same time they worry very much about the safety.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Introduction">Introduction</SPAN></H3><P>This year, we iGEM Japan carried out ”iGEM Japan Human Practices” suggested by iGEM Kyoto. In this project, we drove an attitude survey on genetic engineering and biotechnology cooperating with one another. We attempted to recognize the current situation of Japanese public view, and we will take advantage of this result for future human practice activities.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Motivation">Motivation</SPAN></H4><P>According to the previous result of human practice activity, which was a survey with questions about genetic engineering, more Japanese people chose &quot;negative&quot; or &quot;neutral&quot; than the other nationalities <SUP><A href="#RefH001">[1]</A></SUP>. In addition, it is often said that many Japanese people hate or avoid genetically modified food <SUP><A href="#RefH002">[2]</A></SUP>. We are interested in this tendency. Thus, we attempted to investigate the reason why many Japanese people have a negative impression on genetic engineering. We made a questionnaire below, asking about the impressions on genetic engineering and words related to iGEM, or Synthetic biology.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Advantages">Advantages</SPAN></H4><OL><LI> By combining the results from different teams located in the different regions to share some steps of human practice activities, we can avoid labor-intensive but also improve the quality of the survey result with rich amount of samples.
</LI><LI> We can attract public attention such as Mass-media by driving this activity as iGEM Japan, than as one university team. This will be a great help for many purposes, such as announcing the activities of iGEM, inviting sponsors, or further human practices activities.
</LI><LI> This project will be a good opportunity to deepen the relationships between each Japanese iGEMers. Actually, we are planning iGEM JAPAN project, which includes not only human practice activities but also construction of iGEM JAPAN Website, PR by magazines and participation in symposiums for example.

(*)In Japan, classification of arts and science is important. Most Japanese students study different subjects since high school due to the classification, because it is a big factor to decide the subjects required in the entrance examination for universities or colleges. This is the reason we predicted that there might be some differences between arts and science.

</LI><LI> This result suggests that Full-time House maker and part-time jobber tend to have concerns about food labeling because they have more opportunities to purchase foods than other occupations.
</LI><LI> It may be because “students are less conscious of food”, ”students put a higher value on other heads such as price rather than food safety ” or ”students apply to GM foods”
</LI><LI> About “students apply to GM foods”, contemporary students have had a debate on GM foods at least once in high school or junior high school. So they may tend to have positive opinions because they probably have more knowledge and opinions on GM foods than people
</LI></UL><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Q2">Q2</SPAN></H5><UL><LI>The phrases “Cloning”, ”GM foods” and ”DNA” are highly chosen by people.
</LI><LI>Because, speaking of genes or biotechnology, people especially has a strong impression about DNA, many people may have chosen “DNA”.
</LI></UL><LI>When questionnaire sheets title is “genetic modification”, the phrase ”GM foods” was highly responded. More than half of people respond.
</LI><LI>When questionnaire sheets title is “biotechnology”, the phrases ”environment”, “biofuel” and “biohazard” was highly responded, related to genetic modification sheets.
</LI><LI>Moreover, because biotechnology survey include the word “bio”, the phrases ”biofuel”　and “biohazard” was responded more higher than “genetic modification” sheets.
</LI><LI>The result may suggest that the word “genome” was lower acknowledged by people.

</P><UL><LI>There are hardly any differences between College student and the Other..All have almost same tendency.

</LI><LI>Many people worry about harmful effects on the environment or on us. Some people say GM is against their moral values.

This difference might come from the following reasons.
</P><UL><LI>It comes from difference of generation. For example, when college student or high school student were children, Dolly was already born (1996).
</LI><LI>It comes from difference of education. Contemporary students are taught about genetic engineering and biotechnology in school. They probably have more knowledge than the others about genetic engineering and biotechnology.
</LI><LI>It comes from the amount of chance of household chores, especially shopping. Students do not spend much time for shopping compared with house maker.
</LI></UL><P>According to the results of the questionnaire about both genetic engineering and biotechnology, over half of the subjects said that &quot;the research should continue&quot; in Q7, while most subjects have &quot;a negative image&quot; (Q1, Q3, Q4, Q5). It seems that people only have abstract and unclear image to this 'professional' technique. Genetic engineering is not still so common in Japan.
And many people worry about safety. So engineers are desired to develop safety of biotechnology and spread knowledge about biotechnology.
</P><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Future_work">Future work </SPAN></H5><P>We investigated the tendency of impressions on genetic engineering through comparison between Japanese (different ages, majors, job, and regions). We found that Students think that genetic engineering and biotechnology is not so negative as Other people.So it is necessary that the accurate knowledge about biotechnology and genetic engineering should be distributed to the public audience. However, it is difficult for us, college students, to have a frequent contact with public people. To solve this problem, we can use iGEM networks! This year iGEM Japan attracted Japanese media and our activities have been introduced by a magazine. So we can keep in touch with public people through our activities. This could be attained because we started &quot;iGEM Japan&quot; team instead of having one particular them. So we want to continue iGEM Japan project, and to make this project bigger.
