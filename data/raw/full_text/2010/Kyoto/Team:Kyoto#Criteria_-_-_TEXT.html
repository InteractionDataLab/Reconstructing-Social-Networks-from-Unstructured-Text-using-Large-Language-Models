Develop and document a new technical standard that supports the: (check all that apply)
design of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
sharing BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA, or via the Internet
Please provide the BBF RFC number for your standard:
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.

iGEM Prizes
Best Human Practice Advance
iGEM Kyoto suggested "Human Practice iGEM Japan" project to other iGEM teams in Japan and cooperated with them to survey people's opinions about synthetic biology in several areas.
Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
iGEM kyoto established a standard method for a quantitative measurement of lytic activity, and define it as LAS（Lytic Activity Score）.
Team_Parts
Three parts that we feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
