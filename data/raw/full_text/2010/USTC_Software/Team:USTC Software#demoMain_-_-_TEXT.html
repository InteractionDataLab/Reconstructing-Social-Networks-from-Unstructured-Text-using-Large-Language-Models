Part: BBa_F2620
BBa_F2620
Part:BBa_F2620 had been fully characterized with data in partsregistry BBa_F2620 page. It is a composite biobrick with three individual biobricks: pTetR (R0040), LuxR（C0062) and lux pR. Without AHL, transcriptional level of lux pR is extremal low because of lack of activator, LuxR-AHL dimer. If we add AHL into the system within a very short time, expression of mature GFP is expected to increase significantly. To measure behaviors of the system consisting of BBa_F2620 using our software tool, we construct a system using plasmid pSB3C5 and Part:BBa_F2620 as well as a reporter gene:
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate transfer function of stable GFP concentrations versus AHL concentration. It is of high consistence with experiment done by Haseloff Lab, MIT :
where GFP concentration is directly proportional to its synthetic rate. In our simulation, we add AHL of concentration ranging from 1E-10 to 1E-5 M (increasing by order of magnitude) to the reactor within one minute. Details of modeling are described here .
We also plot time and dose response measurements of GFP stable concentration following addition of AHL. We choose the same AHL concentrations as done in testing the transfer function and plot their dynamic curves of GFP:
A similar work to measure system response of luxr-plux to inducer AHL was done by USTC 2009 iGEM team . Besides measurement of dose response of GFP stable concentrations following addition of AHL, they construct four constitutive promoters, BBa_K176026 , BBa_K176126 , BBa_K176128 , BBa_K176130 , and quantitatively measured their effects to the response curves. The construction is modified by replacing pTet with the four promoters and pSB3C5 with high copy plasmid pSB1A3 (copy number: 200). Since there are no tetR protein existed in the system, we keep lux pR unchanged (it is equivalent to use pLux/Tet hybrid promoter).
The results is shown for each (we plot GFP concentration versus time and compare it with experiment measument):
Part:BBa_K176026 (Promoter Strength: 0.55 1/s)
Part:BBa_K176126 (promoter strength: 0.0192 1/s)
Part:BBa_K176128 (promoter strength: 0.0016 1/s)
Part:BBa_K176130 (promoter strength: 6.4E-5 1/s)
Toggle Switch
Toggle Switch
The toggle switch is composed of two repressors and two promoters, each of which is inhibited by the repressor transcribed by the other promoter. We choose pLacI and pTetR as the two promoters, and the repressors are TetR and LacI, respectively. Theoretically, if ratio of LacI to TetR is greater than 1, strong binding of LacI to pLacI repress transcription initiation from pLacI and therefore quantities of TetR will decrease, which in turn relieves its repression to pTet leading to increase of quantities of LacI itself. In this situation, concentration of LacI is far greater than that of tetR, whose expression is repressed at an extream low level and the system enters into its 'LacI' state. Similar analysis will do for TetR and the system will enter into 'TetR' state if its quantity dominates. To show transition between the two states, IPTG is added in 1s after the system enters into 'LacI' state completely. The assembling of parts are construcuted as follows:
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli .
where we use two consecutive terminators to indicate a complete termination. Time course simulation was performed to generate the state transition:
State of system has changed to 'TetR' state from 'LacI' state after adding inducer IPTG at 40000s.
The legend used in the figure is not clear. 13:DNA;(lacI153)4, 11:DNA;(tetR154)2, and 14:DNA;(lacI153)4;(tetR154)2 means binding products of initial plasmid with lacI tetramer at site pLacI gene, with tetR dimer at site pTet gene, and with lacI tetramer and tetR dimer both, respectively. At the beginning, initial plasmids are all bound with lacI tetramer and the system is in its 'LacI' state. After adding inducer IPTG at 40000s, concentration of tetR dimer increases and plasmids bound with lacI tetramer start to bind with tetR dimer and form complex of plasmids, lacI tetramer, and tetR dimer. At about 70000s, all plasmids bound with lacI tetramer are further bound with tetR dimer. At about 85000s, due to repression of expression of lacI, plasmids bound with LacI tetramer and tetR dimer both start to unbind to form plasmids bound with tetR dimer only and the system steps into its 'TetR' state gradually. Details of modeling is available here .
Modeling Details of Toggle Switch
Modeling Details of Toggle Switch
Key points of this modeling are:
LacI protein tends to form LacI dimer, which tends to form LacI tetramer further.
Only LacI tetramer binds with pLacI gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
TetR protein only forms dimer.
Only tetR dimer binds with pTet gene and thus repressing expression of its downstream genes.
One IPTG molecule binds with one LacI tetramer to form complex IPTG:LacI4 and one aTc molecule binds with one tetR dimer to form complex aTc:TetR2.

Repressilator
Repressilator
The repressilator is a synthetic genetic regulatory network designed to exhibit a stable oscillation shown via expression of GFP (green fluorescent protein). The work is reported by Michael B. Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler in their work at 2000. They constructed a system of three genes connected in a cyclical negative feedback loop so that gene A represses gene B, which represses gene C, which represses gene A. The implementation of this idea used a low copy plasmid encoding the repressilator, and the higher copy reporter, which were used to transform a culture of Escherichia coli.
Parts assembling: the top assembling is the construction used in our software and the bottom one is the toggle switch design in their work.
We construct a model to stimulate the behavior of repressilator, the results are showed as following:
The meanings of the legend used in the figure are demonstrated as follows: [14 (lacI153)4] refers to the binding product of four lacI protein molecules, [12 (CIlam154)2] refers to the binding product of two CIlam protein molecules, while [10 (tetR154)2] refers to the binding product of two tetR protein molecules. The system exhibits oscillation behavior after initial time of 86000, the concentration of (lacI)4, (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 changes periodically as the function of time. To be specific, the concentration of (tetR)2 increase when the concentration of (lacI)4 declines due to the remove of repression. And the concentration reaches the peak level when the concentration of (LacI)4 reaches its lowest level. Then the concentration of (tetR)2 decreases while the concentration of (CIlam)2 begins to arise because the repression from (tetR)2 is gradually relieved. Noted that the concentration peak level of (CIlam)2 and (tetR)2 are nearly more than twice the max concentration of (lacI)4, this may attribute to the difference of binding tendency between (CIlam)2, (tetR)2 and (lacI)4. The internal binding strength of (tetR)2 dimer and (CIlam)2 dimer are stronger than that of (lacI)4 tetramer. more details
