Characterization of activities of promoters
Parts J23100 through J23119 are a family of constitnutive promoters. The absolute promoter strength of J23100 has been measured by iGEM Warsaw 2010 Team (13,1pg RNA/minute/ug substrate DNA for J23100) and the relative promoter strength of other family members are given here . Our values of forwardPromoterEfficiency could be easily obtained by unit conversion. For example, it is 2.18E-7 /s for part J23100. All values of forwardPromoterEfficiency are listed below to character the activities of those promoters  where the second column is the relative promoter strength for promoter family members and the third column gives the absolute values.
promoter strength: the absolute values are measured as unit concentration of RNA/second/unit concentration of substrate DNA
