Liao Chen (8.1): Start writing core codes of our project.
Liao Chen (8.2~8.12): Construct MySpecies class whose objects are equivalent to real species in
biological system. Five modifications have been made until the final version.

Liao Chen (8.25, afternoon): leave for shanghai to get our passport visaed. We played Three Kingdom
Kills (TKK) on the train. The speed of the train is as slow as a turtle creeps.
Liao Chen (8.25, night): So many pretty, tall girls outside of Rolex faced to HuangPu river... what
a feel if...
Liao Chen (8.26): Face to face with visa officer. Three checked, 10 passed.
Zhen Wang
Aug 2 ~ Aug 15, 2010 At first we want to use MySQL to manage our database, later we find Berkeley DBXML is a better tool, so I studied on how to use DBXML. Kun Jiang quickly write an interface using DBXML API and a small PDF instruction, code genius! Finish database format v3.0 – the 3rd version of database, now there are 4 lists, the global, the module, the species, the reactions. Global list stores data that must be pre-defined. Specify database format and give detailed examples on each list. In order to realize the real species, we add substituent in module and chain in species(special thanks to Hao Jiang).
Aug 16 ~ Aug 22, 2010 Read more documents on DBXML and XML. Prepare materials for interview in Shanghai. Liao upload the first version of iGAME core, Soimort upload the first version of iGAME web UI, this is a big motivation to me, seems our game will be able to work finally.
Aug 23 ~ Aug 29, 2010 Prepare materials for interview in Shanghai. All iGEM USTC TEAM members go to Shanghai for visa interview, I pass, but 3 of our member are checked, best wishes for them! Refine the database format, specify bioreactor in module list, compartment&condition in reaction list, substituent changes in species list(special thanks to Hao Jiang). We receive our passports with visas one by one. Draw a couple of charts and diagrams to explain the construction of database, seems I am pretty good at it.[pic] Finish and upload database format PDF and database RAR v8.27, together with some photos taken at Shanghai. Realize work log is very important, so recall my work and write my notebook.
Kun Jiang
Aug 2 ~ Aug 22, 2010 Study the dbxml specification document for developing a more convenience database interface.
Aug 23 ~ Aug 29, 2010 Make preparation for visa interview in Shanghai.
Luojun Wang
Collaboration with Prof. Jiong Hong features the synthesis biology class with IGEM issues and our program. Lectures on ethnics and promotions for iGAME are given during the curriculum, which are partly videotaped. : ) Surveys are also made for iGAME. Statistics have been analysized in many different ways before CIRCOS software runs into my sight. Methods of plotting chromesomes are used in the demonstration of the work, which is the most innovative idea I have ever seen in any performance of survey.:D In the poll on favorite game type, adventure game is on top, can we make a tutor game like Prince of Persia?lol~ Interviewed by Yueyue Zhang, doctor of BIOS Centre of London School of Economics and Politics Science. Opinions on human practice have been exchanged and much new information is obtained from her.(Special thanks to her!)
Shangyu Luo
Aug 2 ~ Aug 15, 2010 With Zhen Wang coming up with different generations of database, I make some discussion with him and help him to modify, specify and complement our database
Aug 16 ~ Aug 22, 2010 Start to learn how to utilize dbxml to aid us in the construction of our database. Be familiar with the environment and command of this software and scan the code to capture the basic features of it which will contribute to handling its APIs in our software Try to learn how to add contents of our team’s wiki
Aug 23 ~ Aug 29, 2010 Use 2009 Minnesota igem team as a trial, I list out all the materials we need in our database but detect that there are some details we can not cover in our database. Try to tackle with this problem with Chen Liao. What’s more, I apply for some financial aid or fund for my trip to MIT and fortunately I get it from my own department: School of Computer Science and Technology! Thanks to the support of my department, I can get a chance to America, to MIT, so I have to express my appreciation again! Though it is just founded before long and doesn’t have much finance at present, my school gives great supports to students and aids them to expand the horizon and improve their abilities in comprehensive fields. With a lot of young but full of research background teachers and professors, I think my school will have a bright future!

Went to ShangHai to get my VISA . The journey was good . I'm not checked ~ so I feel kind of  lucky~~To help WangZhen create new database standard . At the same time , I was designing the Graphic  User Interface and game story . It was a busy month .
