Centre for Biological Signalling Studies
Biological signalling processes are the key regulators of cellular activity in all types of cells in living organisms. A better understanding of these processes not only provides solutions to important biological problems, but also has a major impact on medical research and practice. The Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (BIOSS) in Freiburg uses modern analytical methods and strategies of synthetic biology to study biological signalling processes in a creative and playful way. The main focus of research at BIOSS is to initiate and promote a dialectic process between scientists using analytical (dissecting) and synthetic (rebuilding) approaches in signalling research.
Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg
Not only is the University of Freiburg physically located in the heart of the city of Freiburg – its students, professors, and staff are also an integral part of daily life in the ‘Capital of the Black Forest.’ This is also one of the reasons why Freiburg has become such a popular place to study. Aside from the numerous leisure activities which may be enjoyed in and near the city and its proximity to the Alsace and Switzerland, it is above all the variety of academic progams which attracts so many students to Freiburg. The university boasts a wide variety of degree programs in any of more than 160 fields in 11 faculties.
Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies
The Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS) is the University of Freiburg’s international research college. It was established after Freiburg’s success in the Federal Excellence Initiative in October 2007. As a centre-piece of the Albert-Ludwigs-University’s institutional strategy, FRIAS pursues three main objectives: to promote top level research, to develop new interdisciplinary areas of competence and knowledge, and to foster the advancement of outstanding junior scholars.
