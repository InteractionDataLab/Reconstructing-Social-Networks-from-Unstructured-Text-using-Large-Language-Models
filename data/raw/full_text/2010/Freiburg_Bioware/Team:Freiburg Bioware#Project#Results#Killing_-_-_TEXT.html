Finally we successfully combined different modifactions of the therapeutic viral vector for optimizing it for tumore therapy application. These modifications include the knock down of the natural tropism for HSPG receptor, the tumor targeting using the affibody ZEGFR1907 fused to the N-terminus of the viral coat protein VP2 and an encapsidated vectorgenome that was bricked down and reassembled containing the prodrug converting Guanosine Monophosphate Kinase Thymidine Kinase fusion protein (mGMK-TK).
