Virus Construction Kit - The Manual
We created a universal and modular toolkit for the production of therapeutic AAV vectors. Using our provided Bio- and ViralBricks, scientists can easily and with little cloning effort create their own viral vectors, individually tailored to target different tumor cell lines and to express a suitable gene of interest.
Because our kit is designed to save time and effort in applied therapeutic studies, we created a comprehensive manual, containing background information about AAV biology, different strategies for targeting, purification and 'arming' of the virus particles, as well as practical instructions and protocols for virus production. Using our manual makes it unnecessary to search through hundreds of research papers before being able to actually start your research!
