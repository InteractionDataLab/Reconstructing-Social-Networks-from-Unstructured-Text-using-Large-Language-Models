Freiburg for all concerns of security the <A href="http://www.sicherheit.uni-freiburg.de">Stabsstelle Sicherheit</A>
is responsible and to contact if questions arise. Especially for
questions of biological security Dr. Petra Markmeyer-Pieles is
cognizant. We contacted her a first time befor the begin of our project
in March when it was clear that the Adeno-associated Virus (AAV-2) was
chosen as the topic of our project. At that time she proposed to do the
cloning in the AAV-2 that is for sure to handle under biological
security level 1 and to prepare everything for work under biological
security level 2 to satisfy the precaution principle.
The precaution principle was realized and all viral vectors that
contained a modified capsid were handled under SII conditions until
proven harmless.
In August the planing of the project was completed, summarized in an <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/7/76/Freiburg10_Safetyapplication.pdf">Biosafety

environmental safety?</B></SPAN></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P style="text-align: justify;">
Our project was designed in a way that it avoids any serious safety
issues as far as possible.
When working with infectious particles a minimal risk for the
researcher is allways present. This risk was minimized by restricting
the transduced genes to fluorescent proteins and prodrug convertases
that are already proven not to harm human cells in the absece of the
corresponding prodrug. A potential danger for the public or the
environment was minimized as much as possible by following strictly the
rules of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and the abdication of using
randomized insertions in the capsid and of replication potent viruses.
Minimizing the risk for team members and the society was was allways
one of the major concerns, especially because worries about
undergraduate students manipulating a virus could arise.
The security concept will be explained by quoting and explaining the
six guiding principles for safe manipulation of Gene Manipulated
Organisms (GMOs) as summarized in Kimman et al. ; 2008<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18625678"><SUP>18</SUP></A>.
</P><B>1) Hazard recognition and
identification</B>
Risk assessment has been done and all legal regulations were considered
as described in the last paragraph.
<B>
2) Biological containment</B>
Biological containment means the usage of organisms with &quot;reduced
replicative capacity, inefectivity , transmissibility, and
virulence&quot;18.
For our project only replicative deficient viruses were used,
additional all modifications aimed to have a specific targeting of the
resulting viral vectors for a specific cell type. This gain in
specificity requires it to cut off the braod natural tropism resulting
is an less infective virus copared to the wild type virus.
<B>3) Concentration and enclosure</B>
All working steps for the preparation of viral vectors were carried out
in a BSL II laboratory and within this laboratory work with the AAV was
restricted to a separate Laminar flow cabinet type II. Cell culture and
storage of the virus was also done in separate Freezers and incubators.
All laboratories and epipment that contained viral vectors were
specially marked, for example with a Biohazard warning signs.
<B>
4) Exposure minimization</B>
This aspect of the guiding principles can be sumarized under &quot;operator
protection&quot;18. The Exposure minimization was achieved in our laboratory
by wearing special labcoats for the SII laboratory and gloves that were
desinfected and changed regualrely. During manipulation of viral
vectors attention was payed to avoid droplets and especially aerosoles.
A possible diversion of the viral vectors was avoided by cleaning all
equipment when inserted or removed from the Laminar flow cabinet and
after completion of the work task.
<B>
5) Physical containment</B>
The requirements for the physical containment were fullfilled by
performing all manipulation on the AAV in an BSL II laboratory that
guaranted a restriction of persons that entered the laboratory.
<B>
6) Hazard minimization</B>
For the AAV-2 there are no sugestive activitis because the possible
danger that runs out of the AAV is comparably low, vaccination is not
avilible and biomonitoring is not necessary.
<TABLE style="text-align: left; width: 90%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><TBODY><TR><TD style="vertical-align: middle;"><SPAN style="color: DarkGreen;"><B>Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or
devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did
you document these issues in the Registry? How did you manage to handle

composite parts that were assembled by our Team
this year are alone capable of producing infectious viral particles
when transduced together with a vector plasmid and a helper plasmid
into <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/e/e0/Freiburg10_AAv293_cell_line.pdf">AAV-293</A>
cells. These special cells provide the adenoviral gene E1 stabily
integrated in trans.
These cells are not provided in the Virus Construction Kit nor
availible in the Parts Registry and have to purchased from other
laboratories or a commercial supplyer.
For this
reason we estimate the risk of a accidental transformation of <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/e/e0/Freiburg10_AAv293_cell_line.pdf">AAV-293</A>
cells with all three plasmids for negligible.
Nevertheless we considered it useful to mark every BioBrick or
Composite Part in the Registry that contributes to the production or is
capable of producing viral vectors when transformed under the
previously mentioned conditions.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE style="text-align: left; width: 90%;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><TBODY><TR><TD style="vertical-align: middle;"><SPAN style="color: DarkGreen;"><B>Contribute to community discussions

In principle each research-project that bears any risks for engaged
researchers, mankind or the environment should be treated under the
precautionary principle as proposed <A href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/docLib/TNA12-TuckerZilinskas.pdf"><SUP>11</SUP></A>:
&quot;treat synthetic microorganisms as dangerous until proven harmless&quot;.
This would mean to work on such synthetic DNA containing Bio Bricks at
least under Biological security levels two.
Additional to this secure working environment the system itself can be
optimized according to biosafety aspects, means to reduce it's
viability outside the laboratory. This aim can be approached by
reducing the systems ability to evolve, proliferate and interact with
it's environment. A common method to achieve this goal is to engineer
microorganisms in a way that they depend on nutrients that can't be
found in the environment in sufficient amount.

future of mankind.</UL><CENTER><H2>Broad avilibility of knowledge</H2></CENTER>
n the life sciences information has allways been freely acessible for
everybody who is interested in the results of a particular research
project. The combination of this global availibility with the new
possibilities of the internet broad for literature search and
availibility of gene sequences made it easiere to collect informations
for a possible misuse. 
For the overwhelming majority this open availibility is absolutely
desirely but on the other hand there are also examples of research
results that bear a very high risk to be misused. 
Following we present the three most controversial discussed
publications that could also be read as a &quot;How to create your own
bioweapon&quot;.
<H3>Mousepox Virus in Australien</H3>
The Australian research group around <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11152493"> Jackson et al. ;
2001 <SUP>16</SUP></A>inserted the coding region of the IL-4 gne into
the genome of mousepox. They hoped to create a virus that sterilizes
mice and thus provides a means for pest control. Contrarely to their
expectations they had created a superstrain that killed even naturally
resistent mice and mice that had been vaccinated against normal
mousepox. This discovery could potentially be used to make smallpox
resistant to potential vaccines.
<H3>Synthesis of a Polio Virus</H3>
At the State University of New York <A href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/297/5583/1016"> Cello

recreated the pandemic Spanish Flu Virus of 1918 which killed 20-50
million people. The publication of the sequence provoked several very
different responses that can only be partially be quoted here.

regulations for the shipment of viruses and the willingness to
propagate highly virulent viruses. This causes in his opinion the risk
of possible accidents resulting in the release of the virus to the
environment.<H3>Availability of molecular biological techniques</H3>

The knowledge required for the creation of a genetically engineered virus can easily be accessed from all over the world in online gene banks and publication databases and could be potentially be used for a destructive purpose <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16819443"><SUP>20</SUP></A>. In 2007, Scott C. Mohr published the first part of his manuscript <A href="http://openwetware.org/images/3/3d/SB_Primer_100707.pdf">Primer for Synthetic Biology<SUP>14</SUP></A>. This open accessible document explaining the basics of molecular engineering addresses people interested in genetics but coming from a non-academic background. This development called &quot;garage biology&quot; or &quot;biohacking&quot; is a clear indication for the tendency to have knowledge about molecular biology available in society, as it was seen with programming and computer hacking from ~1980 on.

<H3>Availability of synthesized DNA</H3>


One of the reactions to the publication of the genome sequence of the Spanish flu strain from 1918 was <A href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7065/pdf/438134a.pdf"> v. Bubnoff, 2005<SUP>25</SUP></A> who pointed out the lax handling of the reconstituted virus sequence, the ease of availability and the low effort that has to be invested to recreate a virus:
<BLOCKQUOTE>''&quot;Scientists in Canada are planning to work with the virus, although they will not request it from the CDC. [...] Reconstructing the live virus from its DNA would then take just a few days, he says.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
Technical advances and dropping prices in the field of gene synthesis brings several deadly germs into the range of small research projects or even private persons as for example Spanish Flu (Influenza H<SUB>1</SUB>N<SUB>1</SUB>) with a 13.5 kbp <A href="http://expasy.org/viralzone/all_by_species/131.html"><SUP>*</SUP></A> or even the Ebola virus with a 19 kbp genome <A href="http://expasy.org/viralzone/all_by_species/207.html"><SUP>*</SUP></A>.

In 2006, the “Guardian” journalist James Randson ordered a 78 bp DNA oligonucleotide coding for the capsid of the smallpox <I>Orthopoxvirus variola</I> with the intention to alert the public.
<A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jun/14/terrorism.topstories3"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
In the United States, smallpox are listed as schedule 5 pathogens in the <I>Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act of 2001</I> and are illegal to keep or use without first notifying the civil authorities.
On the other hand, it is questionable if these prohibitions or perhaps the size of the smallpox genome of ~200 kb <A href="http://expasy.org/viralzone/all_by_species/149.html"><SUP>*</SUP></A> are sufficient to prevent de novo synthesis in the future efficiently. His intention was to focus the public's attention to the possibility that one of the most severe plagues in the history of mankind could be synthesized and released to the environment, either intentionally or by mistake. This would be a tragic setback since the smallpox's eradication was celebrated in 1979 by the World Health Organization as one of the greatest victories in the history of medicine <A href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en"><SUP>33</SUP></A>.
In order to prevent the unauthorized synthesis of gene sequences encoding hazardous biological agents, efforts to implement sequence analysis algorithms into the operating procedure of all organizations and companies capable of synthesizing gene sequences are being undertaken.
This barrier should be implemented not on a voluntary basis but as a legally binding regulation. It should be enforced by the government on a national level, but effort should also be made to find solutions for an international progress on this issue.
As a first step, the development of search algorithms as Craic's BlackWatch<A href="https://biotech.craic.com/blackwatch/introduction.html&gt;&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; should be promoted and refined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Additional to this sequence base search for possible misuse of gene sequences, each order of already existing or synthesized genes could first be aligned with a list of countries, and in a second search with the so called Hadex exclusion list that names people and organizations excluded from obtaining dual-use gene material&lt;a href=http://www.idialog.eu/uploads/file/Synbiosafe-Biosecurity_awareness_in_Europe_Kelle.pdf&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The nature of biological weapons - Who is willing to accept their drawbacks&lt;/h2&gt;
When considering the use of biological means for warfare, a potential aggressor has to accept several serious drawbacks. Biological weapons are not fully controllable, harmful effects to the civilian population cannot be foreseen. If replication-potent germs were used for such a purpose, they could possibly mutate and seriously harm mankind or other animal populations.&lt;br&gt;
This makes biological warfare unattractive for most nations, especially because more predictable weapons exist that can easily be directed against military targets with limited collateral damage.
Unfortunately, national warfare programs are not the only source of danger when considering biological warfare. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;" an="" increasing="" number="" of="" countries="" believe="" that="" their="" political="" and="" security="" interests="" could="" be="" protected="" or="" achieved="" only="" through="" the="" possession="" of="" such="" weapons=""><SUP>22</SUP></A> 
Several countries around the globe are technically capable to develop biological weapons or to support terroristic groups in doing so. When this physical capability meets an ideological attitude that is based on contempt for other concepts of society, it cannot be ruled out that biological warfare is taken into consideration.  <H2>Synthetic Biology vs. Nuclear Research - Consideration in terms of security policy</H2><H3>   
When considering the history of research, the dual-use character of technical innovations has always been present, only the reaction of society to it differs from case to case. As an example, scientific discoveries in the field of nuclear physics where treated as classified information having a high relevance for the national security as shown in the case of the Manhattan project<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19784453"><SUP>17</SUP></A>. A comparable censorship is not established in life sciences research apart of some cases when national security was endangered.
Another point concerning the threat arising from biological weapons is the absence of methods that can be used to monitor such weapons of mass destruction as pointed out by M.R. Dando. This fact and the increasing world-wide mobility would make it impossible to prevent the spreading of such weapons when once accessible to potential assassins. 

</H3><H3>Is a revision of basic research necessary in sensitive research fields? </H3>
The publication of research papers containing dual-use knowledge caused several people to call for regulation. In the United States, the so called Fink Committee evaluated the possibility that research in life sciences could be used for biological warfare purposes and how this could be avoided.<A href="http://www.idialog.eu/uploads/file/Synbiosafe-Biosecurity_awareness_in_Europe_Kelle.pdf"><SUP>1</SUP></A>

This committee had two recommendations:
<UL><LI>To familiarize the scientific community with the dual-use problem in the life sciences.</LI><LI>To review experiments of concern. Experiments are of concern if they:
</LI><LI>render a vaccine ineffective</LI><LI>confer resistance to therapeutically useful antibiotics or
antiviral agents</LI><LI>enhance the virulence of a pathogen or render a nonpathogen
virulent</LI><LI>increase transmissibility of a pathogen</LI><LI>alter the host range of a pathogen</LI><LI>enable the evasion of diagnostic/detection tools</LI><LI>enable the weaponization of a biological agent or toxin</LI></UL><LI>To review publications with a strong dual-use factor</LI><LI>To create a National Science Advisory Board</LI><LI>To improve the oversight and reduce unauthorized accessibility of hazardous gene material</LI><LI>To include the life sciences into the efforts for national security</LI><LI>To harmonize the international oversight over dual-use research</LI>

The implementation of these recommendations would be desirable, even though they might cause inconveniences for scientists working in the affected fields.

transgene viral vectors could be used to produce bioweapons. Therefor
it was important for us to use a system that does not bear the risk
that someone could use it for evil purpose. In the case of the
Adeno-associated virus the very limited packaging capacity is the major
reason that excludes it from the list of agents that could
realistically be used for the pruduction of bioweapons. Even a fully
replication potent AAV will depend on the coninfection of a helpervirus
and is therefore not suitable for a fast propagation in an population.
Additional to this point we concentrated our project on the retargeting
of the virus - means to make the broad tropismn more narrow and to
decrease the transduction efficiency in the most cases. This
modification is usually mainly required for medical purposes. Also we
did neither investigate possibilities to shield the vector from the
immune system of potential host nor ways to bypass an existing
immunity.

Concluding all factors mentioned above, we need to consider the possibility that a person, organization or state could misuse the fast-advancing life sciences for biological warfare. The possibilities and the simplicity of dual-use research misuse will become more and easier the faster the scientific progress advances.
Therefore it is important to minimize these potential risks before they become reality. This is not only the task of a designated group but a moral obligation for scientists, politicians and everybody related to dual-use research. Especially scientists have to contribute to and lead the continuing discussion on this topic because they are able to estimate how aspects of their research fields might be misused.
