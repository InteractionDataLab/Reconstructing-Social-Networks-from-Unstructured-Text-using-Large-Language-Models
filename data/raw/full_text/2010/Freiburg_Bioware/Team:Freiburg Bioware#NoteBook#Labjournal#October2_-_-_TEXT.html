Cloning CFP (from P666: PSB1C3_CFP) into pSB1C3_leftITR_CMV_beta-globin (P729)
Investigator Patrick
Digestions, 2 h 10 minutes, 37 °C:
P666: 5 µl DNA, 2 µl BSA, 2 µl Buffer 4 (10x), 1 µl Xba, 1 µl PstI, 9 µl H2O
P729: 4 µl DNA, 2 µl BSA, 2 µl Buffer 4 (10x), 1 µl SpeI, 1 µl PstI, 10 µl H2O
Expected results for the 1% agarose gel:
P666: about 2100 and 750 bp
P729: about 3300 and 20 bp
The gelextraction ...
P728: 11,8 ng/µl
P822: 34,6 ng/µl
... and following ligation (2,5 µl Insert, 5,5 µl vector, 1 µl T4 DNA Ligase, 1 µl T4 DNA Ligase Buffer (10x), 40 minutes, RT) were performed according to the standard protocol. After the transformation (with XL1B) the cells were plated and put into the 37°C room. Two additional transformations were performed with ligations from Volker labeled: "ligation viral brick 453 empty" & "viral brick 587 empty".
The following day the plates were checked for clones. Unfortunately there grew no clones on these two plates contrary to my plate with a a lot of clones.

RNA harvesting
Investigator: Kira
After transfection, the cells were incubated for 48 hours. Today, the cells will be harvested and RNA extracted, in order to perform RT-PCR and an additional PCR for evaluation of promoter activity.
The transfected cells were trypsinised and centrifuged for 2 min. The supernatant was discarded and pellet washed 2x with PBS. RNeasy Kit [Qiagen] was used for RNA extraction according to the manufacturer protocol.

Investigator Patrick
Check the plasmid for leftITR: 0,5 µl EcoRI, 1 µl BstEII, 7 µl DNA, 2 µl Buffer 4, 2 µl BSA, 7,5 µl H2O, 45 minutes 37°C, 45 minutes 60°C
Check the plasmid for hGH_rITR and ... : 0,5 µl AgeI, 0,5 µl PstI, 3 µl DNA, 1 µl BSA, 1 µl Buffer 4, 4 µl H2O, 70 minutes 37°C
Expected results:
leftITR: about 190 bp
hGH_rITR: about 670 bp
Unfortunately the digestions had to be reapeated because i didnt switch on the current so the samples and especially the 1kb GeneRuler marker diffused.
The second run: see above
PstI or BstEII seems to work not properly

ÄKTA Chromatography and Ultrafiltration of virus particles
Investigator: Hanna
ÄKTA chromatography with VP1up_NLS_mVenus_VP2/3 containing virus particles was conducted. Fraction 5 - 10 delivered highest protein concentrations.

Ultrafiltration
Ultrafiltration of CFP_MiddleLinker_VP2/3 containing virus particles and 587-BAP virus particles were concentrated via Vivaspin-Ultrafiltration:
20 mL virus containing cell culture supernatant was added to GE Vivaspin 20 filter and centrifuged with 4000 g at 15°C until 750 - 1000 µL was left-
5 mL Bis-Trus buffer (pH 6) was added and centrifuged again with 4000 g at 15°C (washing).
This step was repeated 3 more times.
Membrane was carefully resuspended and cleared. Suspension was transfered to low-binding eppi and centrifuged with 10000 g for 10 minutes at 15°C.
Supernatant was transfered to new low-binding eppi and again centrifuged with 10000 g for 10 minutes at 15°C.
Supernatant was transfered to new low-binding eppi and stored at 4°C over night. To do: ÄKTA chromatography.

SDS PAGE and Coomassie staining
Investigator: Hanna
Prior to performing Western Blot we decided to investigate running behaviour of different samples.
1. Cell debris (control)
2. Cell debris containing virus particles
3. Concentrated virus stock (containing CFP_MiddleLinker_VP2/3)
4. ÄKTA purified virus stock: Fraction 6
5. ÄKTA purified virus stock: Fraction 7
6. Benzonase treated, ÄKTA purified virus stock: Fraction 7
7. Benzonase treated, ÄKTA purified virus stock: Fraction 8
5 µL Laemmli buffer was added to 20 µL sample. Samples were incubated at 95°C for 8 minutes and loaded onto a SDS gel (10 %). SDS PAGE was performed at 90 V (collection gel) resp. 120 V (separation gel).
Gel was put into Coomassie dye, heated for 30 seconds in microwave and incubated for 1 hours shaking.
Gel was decolorized in acetic acid (20%).

In addition to that one can see that the BSA bands disappear after ÄKTA chromatography.
Next step: Western Blot of ÄKTA purified virus stocks.
