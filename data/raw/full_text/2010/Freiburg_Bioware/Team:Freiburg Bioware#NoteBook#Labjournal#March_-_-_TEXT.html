Sequence analysis
Investigators: Christian W., Bea, Kira, Achim, Kerstin, Hanna, Christian L. (Tobias, Kristian)
Theoretical cloning
Sequence analysis (Alignement) of Stratagene Vector with
AAV2
AAV5
AAV7
AAV8
Result:
Media:AAV_alignment.pdf
Notably, the alignment showed differences in the various AAV2 sequences, some of which are leading to frameshifts. The sequences date from 1983 and might not be completely accurate. We therefore rely on the Stratagene sequence from now on.
To do:
download and compare further AAV serotypes. (in Geneious)
compare literature
find out possible ways to modify the capsid
