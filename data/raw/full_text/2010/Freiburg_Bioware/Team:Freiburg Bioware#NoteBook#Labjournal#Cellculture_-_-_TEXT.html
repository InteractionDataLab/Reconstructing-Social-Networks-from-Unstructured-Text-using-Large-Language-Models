Seeding HT
Harvest + Transduction
Fluorescence microscopy
AAV 293 and HT1080 Cells have been splitted and plated out on 10 cm dishes for transfektion. After harvesting the cells according to the standard protocol the cell-pellets were resuspendiated in 15ml of DYT medium. 2,5µl of this cell suspension have been mixed with 47.5µl of trypan blue and the cells were counted by using the Neubauer-Meteringchamber.
We counted 12,5x 10^6 cells/ml for the AAV293 cell line and 10x10^6 cells /ml for the HT1080 cell line.
1ml and 1,5 ml of the AAV 293 cells have been seeded on four dishes with 250µl of the cell suspension. Note that that the date is wrong on the plates and the flasks! Cells have been already plated out on the 14th. of June.
We also seated two flasks one for each cell line. Therefor we used 1ml of the HT1080 cell suspension and 2ml of the the AAV293 cells.

pAAV_iGEM_mVenus_YFP (glycerol stock B34, P39) P39 has the correct sequence (confirmed)
pHelper
pAAV_RC
2)
pAAV_iGEM_mVenus_YFP (glycerol stock B33, P38) P38 (we dont know if P39 has the correct sequence!)was used because the amount of P39 was not sufficient enough for four Transfections!
pHelper
pAAV_RC
Plasmid concentrations:
pAAV_RC: 1 µg/µl
pHelper: 280 ng/µl
pAAV_iGEM_mVenus_YFP, P39: 180,83 ng/µl
pAAV_iGEM_mVenus_YFP, P38: 179,75 ng/µl
Cellculture clone 1 and 2 were transfected with P39. Cellculture clone 3 and 4 were transfected with P38.
We could only pipet 3,3 µg (instead of 10 µg) from each of the 3 plasmids into the 15 ml falcons due to insufficient amount of plasmid.
Adrian tried to examine the precipation of the CaCl2+ DNA Clusters. We have to optimize the pH of our 2xHBS at the moment it is 11.12.
The viral stocks were harvested according to standard protocol.
The results
Results of transduction, ~ 1% of the HT1080 showed expression of mVenus.

According to the stratagene protocol, transduction efficencies about ~80% are achievable. We performed every step under guidance, so probably something is wrong with the buffers, cells or even the standard protocol. The next step is to repeat this transfection.

Fluorescence microscopy
Six transfections were performed according to the standart protocol:
Three 10 cm cellcluture dishes with 293 cells were transfected with 10 µg DNA (3,33 µg each plasmid) and the other three 10 cm cellculture dishes with 30 µg DNA (10 µg DNA each plasmid).
Plasmids:
pAAV_iGEM-MCS_mVenus (P41), 507 ng/µl
pAAV_RC , 1000 ng/µl
pHelper , 280 ng/µl
Transduction of 2x6 wells was successfully done (14.25)
one six well was transduced with 10µg the other with 30µg DNA amount

The Transduction efficency is still quite low! We have to optimize the stratagene protocol!
30.6 Examination of different Transduction methods
The motivation
We want to check whether the amount of our produced AAV2s has an effect on the transduction rate. Instead of 500µl, 1000µl of the AAV-stock were pipetted into each well.

The results
All cells died probably because we forgot to wash the cells with PBS before adding fresh medium. It was not possible to take pictures because the dead cells were all clumped. Looks like we should not transduce 3x10^5 cells with 1000 µl (or more) of our viral solution because almost all cells died in all approaches and the medium indicator was yellow. So we can not say if resuspendig the cells with the viral soultion is a useful alteration of the standard protocol.
3.7 Seeding AAV293 for transfection with different plasmid amounts and harvesting methods
The motivation
We want to check if the amount of plasmids is the reason for the low transduction efficiency. Unfortunately the flow cytometry (FACS) is not available at the moment so the results can only be checked via fuorescence microscopy.

Fluorescence microscopy
Transfection with P41 (pAAV_iGEM-MCS_mVenus) was performed according standart protocol.  Two transfections where carried out with 10µg (3,33 µg each plasmid) DNA and the other two with 20µg DNA (6,66 µg each plasmid).
We want to investigate which of the following approaches yields a better transduction efficiency.
Half of the transfected cells were exposed 3 cycles of thawing and freezing and then centrifuged (15 ml falcon, 2100G). The supernatant was transfered into a new 15 ml falcon and used for transduction.
The other half was centrifuged at 300 G for 5min . The supernatant was transfered into another 15 ml falcon and the pellet was resuspended with 5 ml of DMEM. The content of these two falcons was also exposed to 3 cycles of thawing and freezing and then used for transduction.
We have got 2 10 cm cellculture dishes with 10µg and 2 dishes with 20µg DNA used for transfection.
Approach with standart protocol (one dish with 10 and the other with 20µg Plasmids)(2100 G and 3 cycles of freezing and thawing)
Deviations from the standart protocol:
The cells were centrifuged at 2100 G instead of 10.000 G
The viruses were harvested after 44 hours
3 cycles of freezing and thawing
used plasmids: 10µg, 20µg GOI-plasmid (mVenus)

We only took some pictures from single cells, because there was no significant difference in fluorescence between each sample. The main conclusion of this experiment is, that we have to get the flow cytometry started.

Conclusions
Higher amounts of Plasmids (24, 30µg) seems to have no obvious effect on YFP expression
Theres no difference in YFP expression comparing resuspended samples to not resuspended samples
The amount of dead HT cells is about 25%, it is not clear if it is either AAV induced or mechanic stress (Trypsin, washing procedure)
Next steps:
does the amount of GOI (ng plasmids) has an effect on YFP expression
compare transduced to non transduced cells (vitality), or in other words is the mechanic stress responsible for 25% dead cell ratio?
comparison of transduction efficiency of different virus stock production routines

The results
Unfortunately the stocks never were used (exception: see following experiment, 7. august) because later on we noticed that the TKGMK plasmids were not in line with the RFC.
7.8 Seeding AAV293 for TKGMK and mVenus stocks
The motivation After proofing the successfull transduction of tumor cells with the reportergen mVenus the next step is to kill the cells with a prodrug approach. The prodrug of our choice is the guanosine anolog ganciclovir, once activated ganciclovir gets integrated into the growing dna chain which results in termination of dna synthesis and cell death. We transduce the tumor cell line HT1080 with viral particles packed with the thymidine kinase guanosine mono phosphate kinase fusion protein (TKGMK) as gene of interest and the incubation with ganciclovir should kill the cells.

The test for functionality for TK GMK was done with the Prodrug Cymeven ganciclovir 500mg from Roche. The final concentration was 0,05 mM in the wells. After two days pictures were taken.
The results
Death to HT1080
HT1080 with gancliclovir only
HT1080 with TK_GMK without ganciclovir
HT1080 with TK_GMK (300µl AAV stock) with ganciclovir
HT1080 with TK_GMK (600µl AAV stock) with ganciclovir
picture from the 40µg stock
As you can see, the TKGMK cell killing mechanism works! The samples with targeted mVenus constructs couldnt be checked because the FACS machine was not working. The fluorescence was checked with microscopy, the transduction efficiency is still low.

The results

Plate 1: A2 and B2, A3 and B3
Plate 2: A2 and B2, A3 and B3
Therefore we conclude that we have to seed between 100000 and 500000 cells for optimal virus production precedure.

The results
As you can see the eGFP constructs worked very well. And even the transduction efficiency of the standard R/C is ok, the conclusion is that in previous transfections the AAV293 cells were to confluent so their transfection capability. The confluence of the cells is crucial! It also seems that our used amounts of plasmids had no decisive effect on the YFP expression because of the obviously variating results. A final conclusion is still due.

The results
There is only one value for each approach but nevertheless the average YFP expression should be higher. We really dont know the reason for the quite low YFP expression. There are also very good news: the reassembled construct (pSB1C3_leftITR_CMV_betaglobin_mVenus_hGH_rightITR) created from the single Biobricks works as "well" as the AAV2 with CMV_mVenus!

0,5 ml of each stock be stored at -80°C.
9,5 ml of each stock will be used for Transduction.
Result:
Standard deviation: about +/- 4,98% YFP expression. All future AAV2 stocks will be pooled if produced with this same plasmids and amounts of plasmids. Unfortunately the YFP expression is still located at around 50%. We would like to have a YFP expression of at least 70% because as soon as we start to test our not yet ready modified AAV2 we suggest the YFP expression will obviously decrease.

As expected the highest concentration of ganciclovir worked the best but it is remarkable that there is no significant difference between the first three ganciclovir amounts. The most remarkable note is, that in future experiments the incubation time has to be extended to 3 or 4 days.

pCerulean_VP1up_NLS_Affibody_VP2/3
pCerulean_VP1up_His_VP2/3
pCerulean_VP1up_mVenus_Vp2/3
The His-tag is for purify our constructs and in this case we want to test, if the particles are still infectious. Construct with the affibody will be tested for functionality and even for their better affinity to our EGFR overexpressing cell line A431.

Interpretation and discussion of our results.
19.9 Seeding AAV293 for checking two different Rep/Cap Constructs
The motivation
During the project 22 silent nucleotide exchange mutations were introduced into the capsid coding construct to make it compatible with the RFC standards and to have single cutting restriction enzymes flanking the 453 and the 587 loop sequence. Two point mutations had to be dismissed, because either a first test transduction showed that the construct was not working anymore or the insertion of the synthesized gene posed serious problems, because the restriction enzyme did not work.
The plan
Transfection and transduction was performed according to standard protocol.
The results
Finally, we have a construct that is shown to produce infectious particles comparable to the current AAV systems and carries 20 point mutations. Now we can announce that the Adeno-associated Virus is compatible to the RFC standard and the idea to replace the loop sequences via ViralBricks works!
22.9 Seeding AAV293 for transfection with different mVenus constructs for checking specific promoter activity
The motivation
We want to check if the CMV and pTERT promoters work equaly in the AAV293, A431 and HT1080 cells. So we transfect them via standard transfection CaCl2. It is obvious that the individual cell lines are not equaliy competent to transfection (the AAV293 are optimised for transfection). It seems that this promoter is not that active in AAV293 cells.
The plan
We transfected the three cell lines A431, AAV293 and HT1080 with following three constructs:
CMV_mVenus
CMV_eGFP
pTERT_mVenus
Remember, that mVenus and eGFP have the exact same excitation wavelenght. We took the pictures with the same parameters, but saved the data in the wrong formate (.tif instead of .zvi), so we werent able to change the YFP expression from green to yellow.

The results
As excepted, the expression of the CMV_mVenus and CMV_eGFP was very high even at 16h post transfection. The pTERT_mVenus construct worked aswell, but significantly weaker!  Problematic is the fact, that there was no expression in HT1080 and A431 detectable. Due the fact that these cell lines are not optimized for CaCl2 transfection. We can't evaluate if the bad transfection efficiency or the low promoter activity of pTERT are responsible for the results.

In this way we are able to create viral particles with this ratios of VP proteins. We hope that the created particles are still infectious.

29.9 Checking location of VP proteins via fluorescence microscopy and checking fractions of centrifugation steps via fluorescence spectrometer
The motivation: We want to figure out if it is possible to purify our viral stocks via centrifugation with 10.000 g and/or 20.000 g. In theory/ according to the literature the viral particles should be in the cells and attached to the HSPGs at the cellular surfaces.
The plan: Two different viral stocks were prepared:
Stock 1 with VP2-mVenus-fusion-Capsid loaded with TKGMK (4 wells from a 6 well plate)
R/C 1: 50% pCerulean_VP1up_NLS_mVenus_Vp2/3 P501
R/C 2: 50% Rep/Cap2: P449 pAAV_RC_4fachmut_VP1-ko:
GOI: TKGMK: P82.b
pHelper
Stock 2 "standard" virus (4 wells from a 6 well plate)
R/C 1 P486
GOI: TKGMK: P82.b
pHelper
These two stocks got harvested according to standard protocol (scratching cells, transfer them in to 15 ml falcons, resuling 12ml solution total). After centrifugation (10 min 200g), the supernatant got transferred into two new 15 ml falcons and the pellets were resuspended with 10 ml DMEM Medium. The Stocks got freezed thawed two times so finally there were:
DMEM as negative control
resuspended Pellet with mVenus-fusioned viral capsids
resuspended Pellet with "standard virus"
supernatant with mVenus-fusioned viral capsids
supernatant with "standard virus"
The fluorescence of each stock was measured via spectrometer. After that, stocks 2 and 4 were centrifugated 10min with 10.000 g followed by an other fluorescence measuring. Finally the stocks got spin down with 20.000 g for 10 min
The results:
Transfection with VP-mVenus-fusion constructs
Picture two days post transfection.
The conclusions:  The highest amount of fluorescence was measured in the supernatant, the individual centrifugation steps had no decrease in fluorescence as consequence!
Keep in mind, without further investigation it is not valid to say that we can purify our stocks via 10-20.000 g centrifugation steps, because we dont know if the viral capsids are still intact! The FACS analysis are not sufficient enough to make a decision, because our last samples had YFP as GOI (=> so efficient cell sorting was not possible). We need to do qPCRs to make a valid evidence.
30.9 Production of new Standard mVenus Vector
The motivation
The AAV2 with 4 point mutations, inserted rep and cap and remutated KpnI restriction has to be checked for its functionality in order to compare it with the wild type AAV2. Hopefully there will be no significant difference.

The primary AAV2 receptor (the HSPG receptor) was knocked out so we expect a worse tranduction rate (about 0,3 to 0,4 of the standard transduction rate, assuming that there are HSPGs on the HT1080 and A431 cell surface). The worse the better.

17.10 Production of AAV2 with 587-His
Investigator Patrick
The motivation
We wanted to produce AAV2 which could be purified via affinity purification. Therefore 10 x 10cm^2 were seeded with AAV-293. Five of these plates contained serum-free medium and cells accustomized to this.
Used plasmids:
pHelper
pSB1C3_leftITR_CMV_betaglobin_mvenus_hGH_rightITR (P541)
50% pSB1C3_001_RC_IRCK_P5tataless (P712)
50% pSB1C3-001_pCMV_[AAV2]VP123_587_HIS (P638)

23.10 Testing the bystander effect of the cytosine deaminase
The motivation
The activated form of 5-fluorocytosine has the ability to diffuse through the plasma membrane. In this way cells get killed which were not transduced by the viral particles. We use an old yfp stock t determine if the transgene expression is on and to harvest the cells which are transduced with cytosine deaminase loaded AAV2.
