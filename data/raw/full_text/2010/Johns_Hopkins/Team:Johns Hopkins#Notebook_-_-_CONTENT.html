We have also established that there is a significant influx of Crz1 into the nucleus associated with this calcium influx as we expected. We hypothesis that the reason we saw Crz1 nuclear localisation only in cells very close to the live electrode because the voltage provided by the function generator was too low to reach across the gap, and so a hypothetical ground gets formed near the live electrode. Another reason may be that as our device has the electrodes at a large distance from each other, comparable x.

Some of these durations are on cellular diffusive timescales, so not enough calcium can enter the cells. Also, cells can quickly move to extrude the excess calcium.
</P><P>Second, consider the channel mechanics. Calcium channel gates alternate between open and closed states based on first order kinetics, where the rate constants are exponential functions of voltage. The open probability curve increases rather steeply, made even steeper since having n channels raises the probability curve to the nth power. This curve was found to rise rapidly between 4V and 8V to a maximum around 8V. At 10V, however, shorter stimulus durations are insufficient to trigger calcineurin, but longer durations kill the cells. 
</P><P>From our experiments we found that there was significant expression of RFP after 40 seconds of shocking. We can also establish that a ten volt voltage amplitude kills most of the cells, which from literature (REFERENCE) is probably due to membrane disruption. The maximum expression we can get without damaging the cells is with an 8V shocking voltage amplitude.

</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Observations">Observations</SPAN></H4><P>From the imaging of the shocked yeast cells lacking vesicular calcium pumps we find that the cells start expressing RFP after 90 seconds of shocking. We saw expression in all the samples between 90 and 130 seconds with a definite trend of increase. The overall expression of RFP was pretty low, however, and only a few of the total cells expressed. It was also difficult to establish cytosol localization of RFP due to clumping of cells. We saw no expression of RFP in the 0 second shock trial.
</P><P>From imaging the yeast samples with vesicular calcium pumps we found very high expression levels overall. There was constitutive expression in the negative control i.e. the 0 second shock trial, and the expression of RFP increased rapidly with increased shocking time, with maximum saturation at 50 seconds. After this it was not possible to visually distinguish weather there was any increase in expression levels. There was definite localization of RFP in the cytoplasm. In the samples with vesicular calcium pumps, most of the cells expressed RFP. Another observation made during imaging was that the cells with vesicular pumps were a lot healthier looking and bigger than the ones without.

We can also establish that the activation region of the CDREâRFP system is between 90 and 130 seconds of shocking, with a definite increase in expression levels with an increase in time shocked. We can also establish that there is no constitutive expression of CDREâRFP from the fact that there is no RFP seen in the 0 second control. The overall expression of the system is weak however and it is only after 110 seconds that more than half of the cells in the frame start to express. We also observed that the cells lacking calcium pumps are smaller and less healthy looking than the cells with the pumps, which is probably because they are less able to deal with calcium shock induced by shocking and so more strained and unhealthy.
</P><P>From the images of the vesicular pump lacking yeast we can see that there is significantly higher expression levels with constitutive expression. We also can see that the rate of increase in expression with time is much higher and the region where the CDRE gets activated is much earlier than with the yeast without the pumps. We theorize that the reason for this increased expression in yeast containing vesicular pumps could be because of a combination of two reasons. First, because they do not have PMC1 and VCX1 knocked out they have the ability to pump calcium out of the cytosol and into vacuoles making them more resistant to calcium shock and hence more healthy and better able to express the RFP. The other possible reason is that PMC1 and/or VCX1 may have feedback loops, and as PMC1 does have constitutive expression the vesicular pump containing cells may be having their RFP expression rates amplified by this effect. We believe that a combination of these two effects causes the increased expression rates.
