Project II -- Y-hunter
Abstract
What we want to design is a model which can detect the signals such as target drug, heavy metal ion in the protein level. The manner that detects signals in the protein level is rapid, measurable. It is another function of this model that is to dispose the signal after detecting it. The way of constructing this model is structure-based. It is made after rational design including molecular docking, molecular docking, mathematical simulation, homology modeling.
