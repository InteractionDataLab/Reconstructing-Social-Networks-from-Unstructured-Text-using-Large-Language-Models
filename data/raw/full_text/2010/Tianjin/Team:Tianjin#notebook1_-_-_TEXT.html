Progress
1.  Construction of yeast surface display system plasmids containing four enzymes: Lip, MnP, Lac, Glox
2.  Transforming to yeast
3.  Detection of enzymes displayed using fluorescence antibody
4.  Detection of enzymes' activity
5.  Applying the system to practice, such as taking care of waste water from paper mills
