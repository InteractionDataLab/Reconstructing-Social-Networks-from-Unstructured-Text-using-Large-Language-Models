Cooperation
1. Our team has cooperation with Zhejiang University team. They designed software Bach which targets at the coding sequence of biobrick itself. Bach could recompose the input sequence into an output one that better suits the host organism and performs the specific translational rate of desire. We sent them the amino acid order and they helped us find the most suited nucleotide sequence in the yeast with their software. Afterwards, we provided them the nucleotide sequence which was optimized by a German company for them to examine the function of the software.

2. The collaboration with ZJU also includes our communicating with questions about operations of chemostat, for instance bacterial growth conditions, medium renewing rates, pre-culture conditions and initial seed volume and how to determine the growth is stationary.
