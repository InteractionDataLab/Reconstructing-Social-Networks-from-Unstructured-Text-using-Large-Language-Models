Name: Qiubin Lin
Major: Bioengineering
About: A guy with enthusiasm to create a bright future!
About iGEM: This is my second time in an IGEM team. The competition is focus on synthetic biology, which is a completely new concept of engineering. I think it is another good way to explore into the secret of life, and it is possible that one day we could reconstruct cells and even life. Moreover, synthetic biology is changing the way biologists think and do, and will eventually have great effect on biology and everyday life. I am looking forward to this day and hoping to participate in such a change.
