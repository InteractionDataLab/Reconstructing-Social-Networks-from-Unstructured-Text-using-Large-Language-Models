Project II -- Y-hunter
Y-hunter
The system contains of two parts. One of them is in the cytoplasm and another is in the nucleolus. There are also three parts composing the device in cytoplasm. They are maltose-binding protein, split luciferase, split ubiquitin with transcription factor LexA+VP16. The part in the nuvleolus is Flo1 gene expressing flocculation protein, which can be opened by LexA+VP16.
The system is activated by ligand maltose. The conformation of MBP will change as soon as maltose combines with hinge region of MBP, which will lead N-terminal and C-terminal to be closed. The split luciferase and ubiquitin will come together since the conformational change of MBP. Entire luciferase will emit yellow light and entire ubiquitin will lead LexA+VP16 to leave away ubiquitin. Then the LexA+VP16 will enter nucleolus to open the Flo1 gene.
