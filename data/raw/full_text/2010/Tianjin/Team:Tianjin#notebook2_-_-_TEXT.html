Project II -- Y-hunter
Material
Most of materials we used is from a kit given by a company, Dualsystems Biotech in Swiss Confederation. The kit contains pDHB1 Bait vector, pPR3-N Prey/Library vector, pDHB1-largeT Control bait, pDSL Control prey, pOst1-Nubl Functional control, NMY51 Yeast reporter strain, DUALhunter library, DSY Trafo kit, HTX galactosidase. In addition, we amplify N-terminal of luciferase and C-terminal of luciferase from a part constructed by one IGEM team through PCR. We also obtain a kind of receptor named maltose-binding protein from genome of E.coli. All the equipments we used during our experiment are provided by Tianjin University.
