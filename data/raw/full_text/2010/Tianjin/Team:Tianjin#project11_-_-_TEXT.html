Project I -- Lignin Terminator
Abstract
We make some Saccharomyces cerevisiae which could synthesize lignin degrading enzymes and put them on the out surface of the yeast through the yeast surface display technology. Those cells, which propagate themselves rapidly, could affix to the wood cellulose material and begin to degrade the lignin quickly with the enzymes of their surface. This yeast will make the lignin degradation pretreatment more secure to our environment and lower the cost. The products of this process are celluase and hemicellulase, which could be used to produce alcohol fuels and papermaking in the next steps.
