BBa_K500000  lignin Degradation 1 (lip) CmR
substrate:aromatic ring material (Non-phenolic )
mechanism:capture the electrons of the aromatic ring, forming positive ion free radicals and causing free radical reaction
BBa_K500001  lignin Degradation 2 (Mnp) CmR
substrate:aromatic ring material (Non-phenolic ) mechanism:capture the electrons of the aromatic ring, forming positive ion free radicals and causing free radical reaction
BBa_K500002  lignin Degradation 3 (Lac) CmR
substrate:polyphenol aminophenol, chlolophenol and so on mechanism:cause free radical reaction
BBa_K500003  lignin Degradation 4 (Glox) CmR
substrate:glyoxal glycolaldehyde and so on function:produce H2O2
BBa_K500005  Luc1 1A
N-terminal of luciferase contains 1-436aa of 550aa
BBa_K500006  Luc2 1B
C-terminal of luciferase contains 440-550aa of 550aa
BBa_K500007  MBP 1C
