Q&A
For iGEM 2010 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects. Specifically, teams should consider the following four questions:
Q1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety ?
A1. For review of our applications by a local biosafety group, researcher safety, public safety and environmental safety are evaluated.
In this meaning, our answer is all YES.
Q2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
A2.No. Our parts are of safety level one and two. We used genes which are analyzed in peer-reviewed papers.
Q3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
A3. Yes
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
The biosafety committee of our organization accepted our applications. They think our project is legal.
Q4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering
A4.Put document number of a review sheet from the local biosafety group.
