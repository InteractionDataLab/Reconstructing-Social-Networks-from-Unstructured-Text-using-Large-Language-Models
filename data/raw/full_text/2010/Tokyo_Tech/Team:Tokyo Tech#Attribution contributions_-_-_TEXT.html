The idea of Artificial Cooperation System was proposed by undergrad team member.
Throughout our project, experiments were done by undergrads receiving some advice from grad students/instructor.
These experiments include series of experiments for data collection (e.g. assay, characterization).
We put the name of undergraduate student who did the experiment on most of the table/graph/chart.
Also, modelling of our system was done by one of our undergrad member, Shohei Kitano.Although we received some advice from instructor,
undergrad student made the blueprint, formulated the system, and analyzed on the computer.    Last but not least, we campaigned to raise funds for our travel.
