We really enjoyed iGEM: Every moment was precious, and we learnt a lot through this event. We appreciated every staff who was involved in this event, and we hope this wonderful event will last long!
P.S. To visitors of our Wiki: Thank you for spending your valuable time in our Wiki! we hope you favorited our project. Let's see you in the iGEM Jamboree! By the way, have you heard they're having preliminary next year? We'd like to propose that even the eliminated team should have a chance to go Boston and present their projects in poster session. Just a thought though・・・we're ready to have a conversation for finding the best style of "iGEM" that everyone can have fun!
