E.Cargo Project Overview
IN SUMMARY
Our E.Cargo project is part of our effort to help manage the increasing complexity of genetic circuits. Complex circuits have many promoters regulating expression of interrelated transcription factors and fluorescent reporters. Once these circuits have been constructed, the actual testing of each component of the circuit (think, debugging) becomes horrifyingly difficult. This project takes advantage of the Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat) Protein Transduction Domain (PTD), a short amino acid sequence capable of dragging large molecules across cell membranes. We created a modular cassette of the Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat) Protein Transduction Domain (PTD) and linker in RFC25, allowing researchers to easily insert any coding region (such as a transcription factor) to be linked to the Tat-PTD. We hope our project will be a useful tool in the management of intricate circuits, or in any other creative application you might find for it!
