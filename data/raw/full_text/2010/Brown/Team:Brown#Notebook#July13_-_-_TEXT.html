Double digested Gary’s WillRS ligation, iGEM WillRS ligation, and pNoTat
Reagents used for 20 µl double digest:
7.8 µl dH2O
2.0 µl 10X NEB Buffer 3
8.0 µl DNA
1.0 µl NcoI
1.0 µl BamHI
0.2 µl BSA
20 µl total volume
1 hour in 37°C incubator from 11:00 AM
Inspection of results from last night’s transformation
All kanamycin plates are already filled with a lawn of bacteria, while ampicillin plates are not. Tentatively thinking that the LB/Agar that was prepared was contaminated with a kanamycin-resistant strain.
Transformation of pPTPi
4 tubes BL21 (150 µl)
2 tubes with 2.5 µl pPTPi
2 tubes with 1.0 µl RFP control
13:53 – incubate 30 minutes.
Heat shock 1 minute
Incubate 2 minutes on ice
Add 100 µl LB and plate on 10 µg/mL plates after letting cells recuperate for 30 minutes at 37°C
50 of 10 µg/mL plates: 720 µl of 12.5 mg/mL stock into 900 mL of LB
E.coli need to be grown on 10 µgmL tet! (L. lactis 5 µg/mL tet)
Ran a 1% gel of digest from earlier this morning:
Lane 1: Ladder (1 kb+)
Lane 2: pNoTat digest                Expect 3 kb
Lane 3: Gary pGEM digest            3 kb and 800 fragment
Lane 4: iGEM pGEM digest            3 kb and 800 fragment
Run at 100V. Started at 2:45 PM.
Ran it for a bit too long --  see gel:
1. kb  interpretation: one digest worked.
Interpretation: After looking at the ladder (1kb+) we determined we couldn’t see an ~800 bp fragment although pGEM and pNoTat were ~3kb, as expected. This means that our blue-white selection white colonies actually did not have the insert.
To confirm/investigate this possibility, we decided to take Will primers and run a PCR to see if we would get any product (pWill1).
PCR of supposedly ligated pGEM (both iGEM-pGEM and Gary-pGEM) using Will’s primers (labeled RER and REF)
(2X – one for iGEM pGEM, another for Gary pGEM)
2 µl fwd primer
2 µl rev primer
1 µl pGEM (plasmid)
25 µl PCR master mix
20 µl dH2O
50 µl total volume
PCR program on thermocycler: “IGEM” Start at 7:00 PM.
Took ~3kb band from gel, pNoTat lane
Gel extraction protocol on 122 mg of gel
Stored product as “digested pNoTat, 7/13”
