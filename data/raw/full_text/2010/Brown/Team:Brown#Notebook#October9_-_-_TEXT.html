Observations
20 μl Tat-L/SB1C3 transformation from 10/5 yielded 1 colony after an additional 14 hours in the incubator.
3 overnight cultures from Tat-L/SB1C3 colonies harvested, miniprepped.
Problem: Control overnight culture (LB chlor, 12 μg/mL) with random environmental bacteria shows significant growth as well. This means that either bacteria from the room has chlor resistance (unlikely), or chloramphenicol liquid screening is ineffective.
