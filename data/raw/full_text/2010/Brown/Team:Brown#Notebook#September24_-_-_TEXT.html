Checking on Overnights
Came in to check on Ethan's overnights- looks like nothing grew - 8:15 AM. Perhaps due to selecting satellite colonies mistakenly? Nothing to miniprep.
Other Notes
Took plates from incubator at 9:15 AM
Tat-L in pSB1A3 plate: 5-8 colonies, will overnight later today.
(8:40 PM: overnight started)
Tat-L in pGEM: TONS of colonies (not countable); only a small fraction are blue! Will overnight later today.
(8:40 PM: two overnights started)
Retrieved PCR samples from thermocycler, will run on gel later
Look for ~100 bp segment amplified by Tat-fwd and rev primers. If present, confirm insertion of Tat-L into pBlueScript.
Miniprepped overnights from 9/23
labeled "mini #1 JH 9/24"
Overnight Cultures
15 overnights of big colonies of AraC, CI, Mnt as before.
Colony PCR on corresponding colonies
50 μl total:
25 μl mix
1.5 each primer (2x1.5) -- later realized this was 10x too much primer
22 μl dH2O
PCR started at 1:38 PM.
5:35 PM
Put 15 culture tubes in the incubator.
