Test Transformations
2 plates: Adrian’s XL1 and iGEM’s XL1-Blue from 6/29.
Used pJExpress, control RFP plasmid as test plasmid
Both plates showed bacterial growth with RFP production. We looked at this under a microscope.
iGEM’s plate exhibited denser growth, colonies of different sizes; fuzzy spots (contamination?).
OD reading for XL1 competence protocols, 6/29 at 600 nm.

Control Smears
Following our test transformation on 6/29 and analysis of overnight Amp plates:
Decided to run two control smears:
Untransformed iGEM XL1, on Amp+ and null plates
Assess whether or not our XL1 stock has yeast/fungal contaminants
Confirm our AMP plates are functional.
Smeared at 5:30 PM, 20µl cells on plate.
pWill Stocks
Added to 2 tubes: 1 colony in 5 mL LB with 5 µl amp stock. Placed in the 37°C overnight at 5:35 PM.
