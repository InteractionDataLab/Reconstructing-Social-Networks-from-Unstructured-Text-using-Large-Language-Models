Ligations overnight
Realized that the carrier plasmid of R0080 (pAraC) is still in the double digest product mix
Need to separate so only the 149bp pAraC piece is put with the RBS_ChFP_TerTer plasmid
Plan: Run a gel (1%) of 18ul R0080 digest product mix + 4ul loading mixture next to 10ul ladder (1kb+)
Gel showed a band ~150, cut and extracted. Nanodrop yield - 1.5(ng - could be ug, cannot read handwriting) per ul
pAraC digest product
M9 minimal media testing
Saw growth in minimal media
Made 1L of M9 minimal media (recipe on 7/26 page)
Filter sterilized
L.Lactis overnight cultures for electroporation (from abandoned miraculin project)
50ul of saturated l.lactis in:
2.5ml MRS (2% glycine)
5mL MRS
7.5mL MRS
10mL MRS
to take O.D. in morning
Incubated @30C at 18:50.
pNoTat w/ WillRS ligation
Transform 6ul of DNA into XL1s from Adrian
Plated out on Amp+ LB
Ran control transformations using control RFP
Overnight cultures for tomorrow
Made overnight cultures of:
pLac/Mnt XL1B (amp+)
CI (amp+)
RBS34 (amp+)
4mL LB, 4ul amp stock
Tried to get competent cell stock (XL1B and BL-21)
