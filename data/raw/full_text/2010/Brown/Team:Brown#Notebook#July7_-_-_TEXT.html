Results of overnight plating:
Empty pNoTat showed <5 colonies (suspect)
Religated pGEM, pNoTat showed no growth.
Control RFP showed colonies
Harvested 4 colonies from empty pNoTat plate.
Added to 5 mL of LB in culture tube, added 10 µl of Amp (100 mg/mL) to achieve total 200 µl/mL
pWill1 Glycerol Stocks
Added 750 µl culture, 250 µl glycerol per tube.
2 overnight tubes (1 and 2) stocked into 2 cyro tubes each.
LB Agar plates
Mixed 12.5 g LB lennox broth with 7.5 g Agar and 500 mL dH2O
Mixed 6.25 g LB lennox broth with 3.25 g Agar in 250 mL dH2O
Cooked both until clear (not sure about concentrations)
Redo Ligation of WillRS and pGEM
7.5 µl 2X rapid ligation buffer
1.0 µl T4 DNA ligase
0.5 µl pGEM T Easy Vector
1.5 µl Will1 RS insert
4.5 µl dH2O
Made competent CaCl2 cells (Quick protocol)
Transferred Xl1 cells with ligation
Plated on amp+ plates, incubate at 37°C starting 7:00 PM
