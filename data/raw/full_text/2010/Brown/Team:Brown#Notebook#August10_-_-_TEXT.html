Miniprep of LovtapTwo WT overnight cultures
7 tubes run in parallel. Nanodrop concentrations:
249.2ng/ul
208.1ng/ul
192.5ng/ul
280.1ng/ul
261.3ng/ul
250.2ng/ul
211.6ng/ul
Digest of Lovtwo-Bgl with EcoRI
Ran a 1% agarose gel. Notice the colllapsed wells (did not significantly affect results).
Interpretation - ligation failed. Will re-ligate and re-transform using Blue-white selection.
Re-ligation of LovTwo into pGEM
1:3 vector:insert ratio. 15ul total volume:
7.5ul ligase buffer (2x)
1ul T4 ligase
0.5ul vector DNA
1.5ul insert DNA
4.5ul dH2O
Transformation of BL21 with LacI reporter construct (J04421)
We used BL21 because CFP expression will be more visible in a high protein expression strain. We used 800pg of DNA (0.5ul of 1.6ng/ul miniprep dilution).
