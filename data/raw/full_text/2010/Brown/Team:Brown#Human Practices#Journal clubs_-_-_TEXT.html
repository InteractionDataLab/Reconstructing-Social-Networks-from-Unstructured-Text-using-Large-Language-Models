Journal Club
The entire iGEM team met over lunch weekly to discuss current literature with synthetic biology implications. Our journal club was formed so that we could interact with the broad range of research occurring in this field and gain more experience reading technical journal papers. Members of the Brown community, including former iGEM alumni and lab associates, were invited to join us and also learn about interesting developments in synthetic biology.
Each week, one member of the team led the discussion by focusing on a single paper to present to the club.
