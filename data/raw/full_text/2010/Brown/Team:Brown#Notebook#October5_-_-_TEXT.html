Did Qiagen purification of the digest first Digest of LacI-J13002 with EcoRI and PstI Double digest 8μl dH2O 2μl NEB buffer 3 (10X) 8μl DNA (LacI-J13002) 1μl PstI 1μl EcoRI
20μl total volume
Retransformation of TatL/pSB1C3
Used 20μl of ligation product (all remaining. Upped the volume to see if efficiency was a issue)
Ran a control transformation of 3 μl control RFP (Amp-R) to test competency of XL1 cells from 7/16 box
Transform 10μl of pAraC+CherryFP ligation from 7/29
Transform ligations of AraC- RFC 25 -pSB1C3-XL1B nanodropped ligation products
used 6μl of ligation product (on Chlor plate)
Control of 3μl of ctrl RFP (on Amp plate)
Little AaraC-XL1B; AraC2 in XL1B; RFP in XL1B; incubated at 9:30 PM
