CaCl2 competence protocol
Zach created overnight cultures of E. coli on 6/21. We received 500 mL of XL1-Blue, 500 mL of BL-21 strains.
XL1-Blue = better for transformations
BL-21 = better at protein expression
9:30 AM – overnight culture was diluted 1:250 in LB; OD readings taken after 2 hours (every 20 minutes at 600 nm)

Resuspended cell pellets in TFBI
Protocol called for 100 mL TfBI per cell type
Added 50 mL to BL 21
This was half of the correct buffer amount
Added 150 mL to XL1-B
This was 1.5x the correct buffer amount
Incubated on ice for 25 minutes.
Spun at 3000 rpm, 10 minutes
Respun XL1B at 5000 RPM, 5 minutes because it wasn’t fully pelleted.
Resuspended each cell type in 10 mL TfBII
Aliquoted into 1.5 mL microfuge tubes; placed in -80°C freezer (trays labeled with paper flags)
