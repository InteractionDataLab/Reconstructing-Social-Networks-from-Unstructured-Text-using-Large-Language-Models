Transformation of pPTPi into BL-21s
Note: XL1 Blue is endogenously resistant to Tetracycline and cannot be used for selection of a Tet-R plasmid.
150 µl BL-21 (stored at -80°C) in each tube (Z)
Added 1 µl RFP control Plasmid
2.5 µl pPTPi
Incubated on ice for 24 minutes.
Heat shock at 42°C for 2 minutes.
Added 0.5 mL LB to each tube and placed in incubator at 3:00 PM.
4:00 PM – Spun at 3500 RPM for 4.5 minutes.
Resuspended in 100 µl LB per tube.
Plated:
RFP Control   --   50 µl on tet+ plate, 50 µl on amp+ plate
pPTPi    --    50 µl on tet+ plate, 50 µl on tet+ plate
Placed at 37°C at 4:27 PM. Overnight.
Cell Transformation of LovTAP into BL-21 and XL-1
Spread 40 µl of 0.1 M IPTG over five Kanamycin plates and one Ampicillin plate.
Thawed three centrifuge tubes with 150 µl competent XL1 Blues and three tubes with 150 µl competent BL-21s.
Added 1 µl control RFP to 1 tube of XL1B and 1 tube BL-21s.
Added 2 µl LovTAP (rehydrated from well 20-F, plate 3 of distribution with 10 µl dH2O) to two tubes of XL1-Blues and two tubes of BL-21s.
Incubated tubes for 22 minutes on ice
Heat shock for 2 minutes at 42°C
Removed from bath and placed on ice, added 500 µl LB media to each tube and placed in incubator.
Removed from incubator, pelleted cells in centrifuge and resuspended in 100 µl fresh LB per tube.
Plated cells on corresponding plates
Left plates on bench (room temperature) over weekend.
Redo Ligation (WillRS + pGEM T Easy)
7.5 µl 2X DNA ligase buffer (rapid)
1 µl T4 DNA ligase
0.5 µl vector (pGEM T Easy)
1.5 µl insert (WillRS)
4.5 µl MilliQ H2O
15 µl total volume
Ran parallel ligation reactions, using Gary’s and our reagents (Ligase, buffer, and pGEM) – 6:30 PM.
1’ RT.
Transformation
7:40 PM Did four transformation tubes:
Diluted 1000-fold (1 µl in 1 mL) of RFP control (5 µl)
Non-diluted RFP control: 1 mL (5 µl)
Gary’s buffers, ligase and pGEM (15 µl)
iGEM’s buffers, ligase, and pGEM (15 µl)
Used Adrian’s transformation protocol:
Thaw competent cells on ice – each tube with 150 µl XL1-B
Adjust final volume of cells to 100 µl with cold 50 mM CaCl2
Add ligation mixture (if in low melt, heat to 67°C, and then transfer to 37°C)
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat shock at 42°C for 1 minute.
Incubate 2” on ice.
Add 100 µl LB
'Growing in a shaking incubator for an hour is only for baterocidal antibiotics; amp is bacteriostatic, so don’t do it for Amp.'
Blue-White Screen
Add 50 µl X-gal (20 mg/mL stock) to cells
Add 2 µl IPTG (1M stock) to cells
Plate out on four amp+ plates
Grow overnight at 37°C
To further develop color after colonies grow up, allow growth at 4°C for a few more hours. There is a chance that the fragment of interest does not introduce a STOP codon, resulting in lighter blue colonies. If unsure, or there are comparable numbers of both colonies, test a few of both.
