CI-pGEM: 8 colonies, all blue. Placed back in incubator
AraC-pGEM: 5 colonies, all blue. Placed back in incubator
Retransformed CI and AraC + pGEM into XL1Blues on Amp+ LB plates w/ xGAL and IPTG for blue white selection
Re-ligation of AraC and CI into pGEM
This time, we are increasing the amount of insert DNA
50ul total volume
