Background
The capabilities of Tat-PTD (2)
Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat) is an HIV gene that functions to increase the transcription level of viral genes. The Tat Protein Transduction domain (Tat-PTD) is an 11-amino acid peptide (YGRKKRRQRRR) that allows the protein to traverse cell and nuclear membranes in order to localize to the nucleus.
As a result of years of study, it is now known that there are multiple methods by which this domain operates. Most commonly, the Tat-PTD interacts with heparin sulfate proteogycans (HSPGs) to cause lipid-raft mediated endocytosis. In the endocytosed vesicles, heparinase causes degradation of the heparin sulfate, which releases the bound Tat-PTD (and anything attached to it) into the cytoplasm1. Tat-PTD has also shown the capability to cause nuclear localization of fused proteins3, underscoring its utility in transporting proteins, such as DNA-binding transcription factors, which must localize to chromatin in order to have any effect on the cell.
