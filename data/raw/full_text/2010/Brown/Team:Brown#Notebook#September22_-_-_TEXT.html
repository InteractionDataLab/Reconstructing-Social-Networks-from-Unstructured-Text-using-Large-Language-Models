Double digest of standard biobrick submission plasmid: psB1A3
20 ul total 10μl H2O
2 μl 10x buffer H
EcoRI 1 μl
Pst1 μl
6 μl DNA (linear psB1A3)
In at 2 PM, 37°C thermocycler. Held at 4°C. Then purified; ran PCR cleanup to purify, eluted in 50 μl EB.
Ligation of digested psB1A3 with Tat-L digest (from 9/16)
(Using restriction digest enzymes EcoRI and Pst1) 30 μl total rxn volume
15 ul 2x rapid buffer
2 ul ligase
1 ul vector
9 ul insert
3 ul dH2O
Ligation of Tat-L into pGEM (using undigested Tat-L) PCR product
30ul rxn total
15 μl buffer 2x
2 μl ligase
1 μl pGEM
9 μl insert
3 μl dH2O
At 6:30 PM, both ligations put at 4°C.
