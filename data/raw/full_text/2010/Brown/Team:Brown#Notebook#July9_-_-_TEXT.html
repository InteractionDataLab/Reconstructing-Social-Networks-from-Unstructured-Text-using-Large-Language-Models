Results of 7/8 overnight plates:
Control RFP (ng amount) showed colonies, higher density than usual (because we were using Gary’s competent XL1-Blues)
Diluted control RFP – showed no colonies
pGEM transformation (with iGEM, and with Gary’s reagents) – both showed colonies, mostly blue spots indicating an unsuccessful ligation.
1 to 2 colonies were white – we picked them and place in LB culture.
1 colony from pGEM (Gary reagent) and pGEM (iGEM reagent) placed in 2.5 mL of LB with 2.5 µl of Amp 100 µg/mL; for total of 100ng/mL amp media.
Placed at RT, 3:00 PM
Placed at 37°C at 5:00 PM
Did miniprep of XL1-Blue/empty pNoTat, following Qiagen Kit protocol; eluted in 45 µl Buffer EB after letting sit for one minute to maximize DNA concentration.
Recommended Standard Antibiotic Concentrations:
Ampicillin - 100 µg/mL
Kanamycin – 25-50 µg/mL
Tetracycline – 12.5 µg/mL
Transformation results
pPTPi – transformed BL21 plates grew lawns
We may try supplementing with more tetracycline. Current concentration is 5 µg/mL.
Supplement: 1 µg/mL
Stock: 12.5 mg/mL
Supplemented two plates with 50 µl of 10 µg/mL tetracycline.
Transformation of pPTPi into BL21
Thawed BL21s (4 tubes, 150 µl cells each) on ice
2.5 µl of pPTPi (two tubes) and 1 µl of RFP control (2 tubes)
(12:56 PM) – Incubate for 30 minutes on ice.
Heat shock at 42°C for 1.5 minutes
Incubate for 2 minutes on ice
Add 100 µl LB, plated, left on for ~15 minutes and put into 37°C incubator at 2:00 PM.
Growing L. lactis using 30°C incubator in B8 MRS plates w/ 0.5% glucose.
