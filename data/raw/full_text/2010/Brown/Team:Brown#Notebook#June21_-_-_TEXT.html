Made LB agar; followed protocol found Agar Plates.pdf
Autoclaved after boiling solution (until it looked clear).
Ampicillin Stock Solution (James)
0.08 g ampicillin trihydrate
50 mL dH2O
50 mL EtOH
800 µg/mL
Placed stock solution at -20°C
IPTG Stock Solution (also store in fridge)
Aliquots should be stored at -20°C and thawed only 3 to 4 times.
1M stock solution:
Dissolve 2.38 g IPTG in 8 mL dH2O
Bring to final volume of 10 mL with dH2O
Filter sterilize (is this necessary?)
Store in 1mL aliquots at -20°C.
0.1 mM IPTG corresponds to 0.0119 g IPTG per 0.5 liter
Every 1 mL has 0.238 g (1 M stock)
0.238 g / 0.0119 g = 20
Chloramphenicol Stock Solution
2.7216 g of chloramphenicol solid
80 mL EtOH
Store in 1 mL aliquots at -20°C.
Motility Stab LB Agar Recipe
500 mL dH2O
1.34 g tryptone
0.67 g yeast extract
1.34 g NaCl
2.00 g agar
Bring into solution; boil for up to 1 minute.
Autoclave
Add dissolved media into a culture tube.
Buffer for CaCl2 competence protocols
TfBI – 500 mL total
30 mM KoAc         = 1.472 g
50 mM MnCl2*4H2O     = 4.948 g
100 mM KCl        = 3.728 g
10 mM CaCl2*2H2O    = 0.735 g
15% glycerol    = 75 mL
dH2O            = 425 mL
TfBII – 50 mL
10 mM Na-MOPS (1M stock)    = 0.5 mL
75 mM CaCl2*2H2O            = 0.5513 g
10 mM KCl                = 0.0373 g
15% glycerol            = 7.5 mL
dH2O                    = 42.5 mL
L. lactis
6:40 PM – L. lactis put into 30°C incubator
