1.1 The Arduino Duemilanove
1.2 Calculating the proper resistor
1.3 Source code
This prototype device uses two super-bright blue LEDs (470nm, 2400mcd) to illuminate cells. It will be used to drive the LOVtap promoter, which is responsive to blue light. The device is controlled by an open-source Arduino Duemilanove microcontroller and can be custom-programmed to cycle through various light states for various amounts of time. The prototype was created using a coffee-cup chassis but the final form factor will be much smaller.
The Arduino Duemilanove
The Arduino Duemilanove ("2009") is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328 (datasheet)The Duemilanove has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button.
Operating Voltage - 5V
DC Current per I/O Pin - 40 mA
Calculating the proper resistor
The LED we used has a forward voltage of typically 3.5V with a max of 4V. The Arduino Duemilanove outputs at 5V. Thus, we used the resistor calculator located here to calculate the proper resistors to use:
We only had a limited number of resistor types in stock, so we used a 56 Ohm resistor. The light output was not as bright as we wanted, so we switched to a 37 Ohm resistor. This may stress the LED more than usual, but should be enough resistance that it will not easily burn out.

Light Induction Device
Turns on an LED on for a specific amount of time, then off, and repeats
The circuit:

int ledPin =  13;    // LED connected to digital pin 13
int ledPin2 = 12;    // LED connected to digital pin 12
// The setup() method runs once, when the sketch starts
void setup()   {
// initialize the digital pin as an output:
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
pinMode(ledPin2, OUTPUT);
}
// the loop() method runs over and over again
void loop()
{
digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);   // set the LED1 on
digitalWrite(ledPin2, HIGH);  // set the LED2 on
delay(14400000);                  // wait for 4 hours
digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);    // set the LED1 off
digitalWrite(ledPin2, LOW);   // set the LED2 off
delay(14400000);                  // wait for 4 hours
