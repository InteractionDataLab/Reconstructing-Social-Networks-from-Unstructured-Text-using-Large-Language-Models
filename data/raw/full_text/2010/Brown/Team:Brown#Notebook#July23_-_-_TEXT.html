Observations on plates from yesterday
Lawns on amp plates with peking plasmid cells. Apparently, too many cells per plate.
Gel of miniprep ligations
Ran all 8 miniprep (WillRS+pGEM) ligations (lanes 2-8) with a 1kb ladder
Imaging results: It appears we have the insert!
Next steps:
Digest with Nco1 and BamHI (BSA not important, but make sure to use the correct buffer and not too much DNA)
Gel-isolate ~800bp band
Prepare 2 samples for sequencing
Note - use NEB NcoI, BamHI, and Buffer3 only
Ran producs of 7/22 PCR
Of the 20ul PCR product, added 4ul loading buffer, placed 10 of 24ul mixture into each well, placed10ul ladder into each well. Image of gel will be tracked down
Digest of #1-4 pGEM WillRS constructs miniprep
Master mix (x4.5)
58.75ul dH2O
27ul 10x buffer 3
6.75ul NcoI
6.75ul BamHI
2.7ul BSA
Reaction (50ul total volume)
5ul NEB buffer 3 10x
6ul DNA (miniprep)
1.5ul NcoI
1.5ul BamHI
0.5ul BSA
35.5ul dH2O
