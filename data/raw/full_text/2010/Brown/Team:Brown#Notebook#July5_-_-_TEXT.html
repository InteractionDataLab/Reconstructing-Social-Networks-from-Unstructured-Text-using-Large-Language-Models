Transformation of XL1-B with ligations (failed)
Followed competent cell making protocol (quick CaCl2 method).
Had a small but visible pellet after centrifuging.
Started liquid culture of Gary’s XL1-Blues, added 1 mL of LB and incubated.
12 µl pGEM ligation
12 µl pNoTat ligation
5 µl RFP control DNA
Separate tubes, added our competent cells to each.
Incubated for 20-30 minutes on ice (25 min).
Heat shock 2 minutes at 42°C (actual: 44-45°C, don’t know if this affects anything.
Plated 50 µl out on each amp++ plate
20 µl on each 1/3 of null plate.
Incubated at 37°C overnight; start at 7:15 PM.
