Results of overnight plates
J04421 transformation grew extremely high concentration of colonies, we will redo with much less DNA.
Calculations showed that we used 3ul @ 162ng/ul: way too much DNA.
AraC reporter showed no growth, We predict it was because of a failure in the ligation from 7/29.
Retransformation of LacI reporter (J04421)
Dilute the J04421 miniprep 1:100 (so that DNA is 1.6ng/ul).
Add 5mL dilution: ~8ng DNA
Gel of yesterday's PCR
Ran a gel of the PCR product from yesterday. Isolated a band that (hopefully) corresponds to the amplification of the LovTAP w/ BglBrick primers. We will gel-extract the DNA tomorrow.
