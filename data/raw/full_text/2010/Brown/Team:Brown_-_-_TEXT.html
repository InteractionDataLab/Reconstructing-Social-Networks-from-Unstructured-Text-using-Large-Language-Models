Team
Welcome!
Welcome to the wiki site of the 2010 Brown iGEM team ! This year, we sought to identify and improve upon two issues we saw in genetic circuit design and testing. Our first project deals with multi-state circuits and proposes a more simplified method of circuit control: triggering states through the clean input of light patterns. Second, we present a tool for a simplified method of transiently activating/regulating targeted portions of a circuit without the addition of test plasmids. We hope that our contributions will aid iGEM teams and researchers to clarify the control of their devices and more easily test and characterize their circuits!
Achievements
Medal Progress
The requirements to earn a Bronze Medal are:
Register the team, have a great summer, and have fun attending the Jamboree.
We are registered and hope to have great fun at the Jamboree. Our whole summer and semester has been building up to this, and we can't wait to present our work!
Successfully complete and submit a Project Summary form.
Done!
Create and share a Description of the team's project via the iGEM wiki.
Our Project
Present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We have a presentation prepared and our poster is coming soon.
Enter information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Parts
See our Parts page for information about our submitted parts
Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry of Parts.
We submitted physical DNA for key BioBricks!
Other Achievements
We deterministically modeled our Light-Pattern circuit. Read more at our Modeling page
We created a customizable, open-source, electronic device for the induction of our Light circuit. Read more at our Light Induction Device page
We surveyed over 470 people about their knowledge of and opinions on synthetic biology. Read more at our Survey page
We presented our work to the community and created a network of potential iGEM participants for next year. Read more at our Outreach page
We held weekly Synthetic Biology journal clubs open to the Brown community. Read more at our Journal Clubs page
Most importantly, we faced many obstacles and failures, and learned a lot from them. Read our concluding statement about what we've gotten out of this experience at our Obstacles/Lessons page
