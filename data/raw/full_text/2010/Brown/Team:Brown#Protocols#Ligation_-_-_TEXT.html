Ligation
7.5 µl 2X DNA ligase buffer (rapid)
1 µl T4 DNA ligase
0.5 µl vector
1.5 µl insert
4.5 µl dH2O
15 µl total volume
24-36 hours at 4°C. Alternatively 1 to 2 hours at room temperature may also work, although we found a generally lower ligation efficiency using this method.
Note: Generally aim for a 1:3 vector to insert ratio.
