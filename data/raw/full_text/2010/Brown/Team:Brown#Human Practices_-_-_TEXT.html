Human Practices
This section documents our interests and concerns with safety, our community, and the broader field of synthetic biology.
Check out the results of our survey on Synthetic Biology that we distributed to the Brown University community! We garnered over 450 responses from students, professors, future scientists and non-scientists.
Read about our outreach efforts to our community.
We also had weekly Journal Club meetings .
Last but not least, here is our safety documentation.
