Plans for inserting WillRS into pNoTat
Digest pNoTat with NcoI and BamHI
Ligate (overnight 4C or overnight 16C in PCR) pNoTat and WillRS
1) Double digest
20ul total volume
7.8ul dH2O
2ul 10X NEB Buffer3
8ul DNA
1ul NcoI
1ul BamHI
0.2ul BSA
1 hour at 37C. Started at 11:37AM.
PCR Cleanup (Qiagen Kit) of pNoTat digest
5 volumes of Buffer PB1 to one volume digest sample and mix. Centrifuge. Add 0.75ml buffer PE
2) Ligation of 4C overnight
15ul total volume
7.5ul ligase buffer
1.0ul T4 DNA ligase
0.5ul vector (pNoTat digested and purified)
1.5ul insert (WillRS)
4.5ul dH2O
Double Digest of pAraC (R0080) and RBS-ChFP_TerTer (J06702)
Purpose - to join pAraC with ChFP to create a reporter construct
Digest pARaC w/ EcoRI, SpeI in buffer II (NEB)
Digest J06702 w/ EcoRI, XbaI in buffer II (NEB)
pAraC will be taken out of plasmid, whereas J06702 plasmid will be opened up
20ul total volume
7.8ul dH2O
2ul 10X NEB Buffer3
8ul DNA
1ul NcoI
1ul BamHI
0.2ul BSA
incubate 1hr@37C, starting at 3:20PM
PCR cleanup (using gel extract kit)
Ligation overnight @4C
7.5ul ligase buffer
1ul T4 ligase
4.5ul dH2O
0.5ul J06702 (vector)
1.5ul pAraC (insert)
2 tubes (trials)
Testing M9 minimal media
4mL M9min w/ XL1s
4mL m9min not inoculated
Incubated @37C at 6:35PM. Also took 5ml min media w/ lovtap and lovtap2 and it grew overnight to saturation
Transformations of parts from registry
Used cells labeled XL1-B 7/16. We have recently discovered that these cells are contaminated with Kan resistance, so cannot yet transform Mnt because its plasmid uses Kan for selection.
