(Re?)digestion of RBS34
50ul total volume
5ul NEB 10x buffer 2
39.5ul dH2O
1ul EcoRI
1ul SpeI
0.5ul 100x BSA
3ul miniprep of RBS34
Gel appears to be cloudy and contaminated
Kan/Tet plate test results
None of the hand-contamination plates grew. XL1s on tet plates grew, but not BL21s. From this, we conclude that the XL1Bs may be contaminated with Tet resistance.
PCR of reporter system
Rehydration of primers
Fwd - 156ul dH2O added
Rev - 171.2ul dH2O added
PCR
50ul total volume
2ul fwd primer (10uM)
2ul reverse primer (10uM)
1ul template DNA
25ul master mix
20ul dH2O
Transformation of reporter constructs
LacI reporter - from iGEM HQ, part J04421 miniprep product
AraC reporter - from ligation on 7/29 of pAraC and J06702
3ul of each DNA in XL1Bs, standard 30min incubation and 1min heatshock.
