Modeling the Quad-state Circuit
Because our light circuit consists of four distinct steady states, we choose to model our system initially using a deterministic system. In this section, we will discuss the following:
The system of ordinary differential equations that we formulated to model our system and the biological basis for each
The parameters we used in our model and the basis for them
The results of our model and the conclusions drawn from them
The illumination device we designed to induce the state switching of our circuit.
