Restriction Digest protocol
Brown iGEM 2010, modified from Knight Lab protocol.
Materials
Restriction enzymes (we use NEB)
NEB buffer 2/3 (use buffer finder on NEB website. Buffer 2 is standard for iGEM enzymes)
BSA
Deionized, sterile H2O
Digest mix
The reaction below is a 50ul reaction, 100ul reactions are also common if you want your DNA to be dilute.
5ul NEB Buffer 2
Xul DNA (usually ~500ng)
0.5ul 100x BSA
1ul Restriction Enzyme (regardless of the reaction, 1ul is used because this generally represents a 10-25 fold excess. It is also sticky due to its glycerol content, so pipetting can be difficult)
1ul Restriction Enzyme 2 (for double digests)
(42.5-X)ul dH2O
Protocol
Add appropriate amount of deionized H2O to sterile 0.6 mL tube
Add restriction enzyme buffer to the tube.
Vortex buffer before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.
Add BSA to the tube.
Vortex BSA before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.
Add appropriate amount of DNA to be cut to the tube.
Vortex DNA before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.
Add 1 μL of each enzyme.
Vortex enzyme before pipetting to ensure that it is well-mixed.
Also, the enzyme is in some percentage of glycerol which tends to stick to the sides of your tip. To ensure you add only 1 μL, just touch your tip to the surface of the liquid when pipetting.
Place in thermal cycler (MJ Research, PT-200) and run digest protocol.
4-6 hour incubation at 37°C
Use a longer incubation time if you have time or are worried about the efficiency of cutting. I think this time can be shortened to 2 hrs while still cutting to completion.
20 mins at 80°C to heat inactivate enzyme.
This step is sufficient to inactivate even Pst I.
4°C forever (or until you pull the reaction out of the thermal cycler).
Generally, use some method of DNA purification to eliminate enzymes and salt from the reaction.
