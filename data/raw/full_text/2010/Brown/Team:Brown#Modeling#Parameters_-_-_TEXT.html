Modeling Parameters
As our circuit is relatively complex, we have many factors and thus many parameters with which to describe the function of these factors mathematically.
These parameters are as follows:
δ is a function designed to represent the presence/absence of light in a Boolean fashion. δ=0 without light and 1 with light.
c_1 represents the rate of conformational change from LovTAP to LovTAP* when irradiated with 470nm light.
c_2 represents the rate of SupD + T7ptag --> T7 polymerase
α represents the maximum protein synthesis rate in nanomoles/sec.
β represents the basal synthesis rate. We assume ∀x β_x= .01α_x
μ represents the protein degradation rate.
n represents a ligand’s hill coefficient.
K_m represents the ligand’s dissociation constant
For a complete, up-to-date list of values and sensitivities, please see our current spreadsheet of parameters and sensitivities (or here for closed source Microsoft Excel format).
