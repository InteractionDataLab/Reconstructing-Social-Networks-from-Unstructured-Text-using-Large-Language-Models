Restriction digest of miniprepped Bgl-LovTWO/pGEM ligation
Expect 1079bp band (construct) and ~3kb band (pGEM)
50ul total volume (x3)
5ul NEB buffer 3 (10x)
2ul miniprep DNA
0.5ul 100x BSA
1ul BglII
41.5ul dH2O
This digest should show we have functioning BglII sites.
^The above reaction was not carried out as we ran out of BglII enzyme
50ul total volume (x3)
5ul NEB buffer 3 (10x)
2ul miniprep DNA
0.5ul 100x BSA
1ul EcoRI
41.5ul dH2O
This digest should show we have inserted properly into pGEM
Nanodrop data of miniprep DNA (Bgl/Lovtwo/pGEM ligation)
Tube A - 371.1ng/ul
Tube B - 358.6ng/ul
Tube C - 346.7ng/ul
Overnight culture
Started overnight of XL1 containing J04421 (lacI reporter). 5mL of LB amp. Will look for constitutive CFP production.
