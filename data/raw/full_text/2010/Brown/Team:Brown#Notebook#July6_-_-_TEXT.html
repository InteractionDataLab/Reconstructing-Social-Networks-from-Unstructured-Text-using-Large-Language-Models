Results of yesterday’s transformation:
Null plate: everything grew (control RFP, pGEM, pNoTat).
Amp++ XL1-Blue transformation with RFP  grew normally, no contamination.
Amp++ Xl1-Blue / pNoTat  no growth
Amp++ Xl1-Blue / pGEM  no growth.
This suggests that there’s nothing wrong with our plates or bacteria… they just didn’t get the plasmid. Or, there’s something wrong with our plasmid.
2 options:
Re-ligate with purified, cut pNoTat + WillRS.
Restart from the double digest… purify, ligate, and follow through with transformation.
Created another liquid culture of E. coli XL1-Blues transformed with pWill1. 3 mL of LB + scraped colony from plates (XL1-blue with control amp) (XL1-blue 6/24/10 labeled tube)
pGEM – TA overhangs on WillRS pNoTat – need sticky ends on WillRS
Ligation of pWillRS and pGEM T Easy
7.5 µl 2X Buffer (rapid)
1.0 µl T4 DNA ligase
0.5 µl vector (pGEM T Easy)
1.5 µl insert (Will RS)
4.5 µl dH2O
15 µl total volume
7.5 µl 2X Buffer (rapid)
1.0 µl T4 DNA ligase
0.5 µl vector (pNoTat)
1.5 µl insert (Will RS)
4.5 µl dH2O
15 µl total volume
11:50 AM begin at room temp
 use 5 µl for a transformation
Transformation of XL1-Blues with pNoTat, pGEM, RFP Control
Cell Competence protocol
11:27 AM    Added 1.5 mL LB to cell culture to increase volume of overnight culture.
11:40 AM    Placed cells on ice, to PRIMO for procedure
12:06 PM    Spun at 4°C, 5 minutes, 3,000 RPM
12:11 PM    Resuspended in 1 mL CaCl2 per aliquot. Placed on ice for 15 min.
12:27 PM    Spun cells at 4°C
12:36 PM    Resuspended in 250 µl CaCl2 per tube. Transformations were conducted with 150 µl cells each tube.
4:56 PM    Cells spun down 1 min @ 3k RPM, Then 3 min @ 3k RPM, Then 3 min @ 3k RPM
Removed 250 out of 500 µl supernatant per tube.
Plated 50 µl per plate
Remaining cells placed in refrigerator (at 4°C).
Placed in 37°C overnight, at 5:15 PM
Took 3 µl of empty pNoTat plasmid, transformed ~150 µl of CaCl2 competent cells made earlier today.
Plated out at 7:15 PM on amp++ plate
Pelleted, reduced cell suspension volume to 250 µl.
