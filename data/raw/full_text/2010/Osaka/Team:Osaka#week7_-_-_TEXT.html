September 7 (Tue)
Miniprep of 004, 005
Cut check with EcoRI, SpeI
both insert lengths ok!
Transformation of DNA for PGA synthesis-related genes (See Table 9)
Transfer to solution culture
004, 005 transformed on 9/5 (pick up from fresh colonies) -> needed more plasmid
2-10F, 2-10H transformed yesterday

glutamine racemase
September 8 (Wed)
Miniprep 2-10F, 2-10H, 004, 005
Restriction digest of above parts with EcoRI, SpeI; also with only EcoRI as negative control
Gel electrophoresis
new batch of EtBr for staining
(RESULTS?)
Transfer of A01~A03 to solution culture
PCR to make Silver standard-compatible parts from 2-20J (CenA) and 2-20J (Cex) based on protocol in Takara Ex Taq polymerase kit
it took several tries to get a successful reaction
1st attempt: template DNA was used directly; concentration too high (failure)?
2nd attempt: 100X, 1000X dilutions attempted without success; this time, over-dilution or stringent annealing temp (68°C) may have been culprit?
3rd attempt: 10X dilutions, annealing temp lowered to 65°C -> success!
note: reactions were evaluated by gel electrophoresis of crude PCR product - if band appears at approximately correct length then reaction judged as successful
special note of thanks to Nakamura who stayed in lab overnight to run the PCRs
September 9 (Thu)
Miniprep of A01, A02, A03 followed by restriction digests with EcoRI
Purification of 9/8 PCR products from gel using QIA Quick Spin gel extraction kit (why not use PCR purification kit??)
Restriction digest of A01~03 with EcoRI, PCR products with XbaI, PstI
Gel electrophoresis of digested parts together with 1-5A 1-5A supposed to be receiving vector, but digested at wrong sites
CenA PCR product -> OK (Silver-compatible part designated FcenA)
Cex PCR product -> ?
Another round of PCR to amplify Cex as Silver standard part (why?)
10X dilution of template
68°C annealing temp
Ligation
FcenA: PCR product with 1-5A as vector (cut/ligated at X, P)
006: 3A assembly of 004 (upstream), FcenA (downstream), 1-5A (vector)
007: 3A assembly of 005 (upstream), FcenA (downstream), 1-5A (vector)
008: 3A assembly of 001 (upstream), Cex PCR product (downstream), 1-5A (vector) bad insert?
009: 3A assembly of 001 (upstream), FcenA (downstream), 1-5A (vector)
Transformation of newly assembled parts 006~009
Transfer of 006~009 to solution culture.
September 10 (Fri)
Gel electrophoresis of PCR product from Cex and 2-20H (original Cex part) for comparison
PCR product seems ok -> purification from gel; Silver-compatible part designated Fcex
Restriction digests of 004 & 005 (9/4 ligations) with EcoRI, SpeI; followed by gel electrophoresis
(RESULTS?)
Restriction digests of Fcex (purified today), FcenA (amplified on 9/9) with XbaI, PstI followed by gel electrophoresis
(RESULTS?)
Ligations
Fcex: PCR product from Cex with 1-5A as vector (cut/ligated at X, P)
006: 3A assembly of 004 (upstream), FcenA (downstream), 1-5A (vector); repeat
007: 3A assembly of 005 (upstream), FcenA (downstream), 1-5A (vector); repeat
