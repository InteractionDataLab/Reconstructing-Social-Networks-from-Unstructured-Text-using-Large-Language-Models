Week2 : August 1 - August 7
August 2 (Mon)
Attendance: Torigata, Takino, Teoh, Tadashi, Yasumoto, Saka
Culture medium preparation
LB agar plates (49 antibiotic-less plates)
LB liquid medium (500 ml)
Competent cells preparation - Nojima Method
SOB medium (MgCl2 not yet added) -> stored at 4˚C
TB buffer -> stored at 4˚C
Single-colony streaking of E. coli (strain DH5α) on 2 LB agar plates -> 37˚C incubation o/n
Tomorrow we shall prepare the remainder of the reagents and inoculate SOB with o/n-incubated E. coli.
August 3 (Tue)
Attendance: Nakamura, Kakuda, Saka, Yasumoto, Teoh
Competent cells preparation (continued)
Preparation of glucose solution for making SOC medium.
Inoculation of pre-culture SOB from o/n-incubated agar plate colonies.
(Night) Transfer from pre-culture to growth culture.
August 4 (Wed)
Attendance: Nakamura, Saka, Kakuda, Yasumoto, Torigata, Teoh
OD measurements throughout the day till required OD (0.3~0.7) was obtained.
Completion of competent cells according to protocol.
August 5 (Thu)
Attendance: Nakamura, Yasumoto, Saka, Kakuda, Takino

RFP coding
Note: 'ID' is an internal identifier used by wet work members to simplify labeling etc. In the case of iGEM distribution parts it usually refers to the plate location.
August 6 (Fri)
Attendance: Nakamura, Saka, Yasumoto, Takino, Teoh
Colony check
All transformed cells produced colonies!
Non-transformed cells (negative controls) did not grow on Amp, Kan or Cam plates -> confirmed lack of natural antibiotic resistance
Colonies transferred to 3ml LB growth medium & incubated o/n at 37˚C
August 7 (Sat)
Attendance: Nakamura, Saka, Yasumoto, Takino
Miniprep of o/n-incubated colonies (2-20J, 2-20H, 1-2M, 1-13D, 1-1D, 1-18F) using Sigma-Aldrich Plasmid Miniprep Kit
