September 19 (Sun)
PCR of pgsB (repeat)
again, no product :(
PCR of pgsB (4th attempt, including yesterday's)
no product
Miniprep of 004, 005, 008, 009, 018, 019
Restriction digest of 018 with EcoRI, SpeI; 019 with XbaI, PstI
Gel electrophoresis of pgsA, 004, 005, 008, 009, 018, 019
apart from 018 & 019, all are parts digested before; used here to compare with new parts 018, 019
(RESULTS?)
problem with 019?
PCR of pgsB 1st fragment (5th attempt)
(RESULTS?)
PCR of pgsB - generation of 2nd fragment (170bp) for overlap extension
PCR of pgsB - generation of 3rd fragment (1000bp) for overlap extension
PCR: Phusion activity check using BglX as template & the primers that generated it
PCR: pgsB template check using the outermost primers
September 20 (Mon)
Transfer to solution culture: 004, 005, 006, 007, 008 ,009 ,019
PCR: Phusion polymerase & template checks (repeat of 9/19?)
positive control (BglX) was amplified -> Phusion polymerase seems to be working ok
problem with template? primer? thermocycle settings?
PCR: primer check
pair of primers for each overlap segment were tested
(RESULTS?)
Digestion of pgsA (PCR product) and 1-1C with EcoRI, PstI
Ligation to make new part 020: pgsA as insert, 1-1C as vector
Transformation of ligation product
PCR of pgsB 1st fragment (n-th repeat??)
Note: MANY MANY rounds of PCR carried out today; due to time constraints they are not described here in detail
September 21 (Tue)
Miniprep of yesterday's cultures: 004, 005, 006, 007, 008 ,009; 019 was discarded (turned red)
Restriction digest of miniprepped parts with EcoRI, SpeI
Gel electrophoresis of digested parts 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 009, 019 (?)
005 - OK
014 - no band visible
019 - bad length - repeat ligation
006, 007 - bad lengths; repeat colony pick-up & culture?
PCR to synthesize C-terminal half of pgsB (overlap extension method continued)
band of correct size obtained!
PCR cloning of Man26B, CelB
gel run failed to turn up bands; repeat with lower annealing temp
repeat run succeeded!
Inoculated YPD liquid culture medium with yeast
New part 020 (contains pgsA) transferred to solution culture
PCR of pgsB (final step - extension of overlapping fragments)
Gel electrophoresis to extract PCR products (Man26, CelB) as well as 1-5A for plasmid backbone
September 22 (Wed)
Gel electrophoresis of 1-5A, 1-3A, 1-1C, PCR product (pgsB) followed by extraction/purification
Restriction digest of extracted parts with EcoRI, SpeI
Miniprep of 020
Restriction digest of 020 with XbaI, PstI (for gel run to check & further assembly)
Restriction digest of pgsC, pgsA with EcoRI, SpeI
Gel electrophoresis of all digested parts above
020 was bad; repeat ligation?
Transfer of 006, 007 to solution culture (pick up from new colonies?)
Ligations
019: pgsC (PCR product) into 1-1C vector
020: pgsA (PCR product) into 1-1C vector
021: pgsB (PCR product) into 1-1C vector
all using PCR products purified today
Transformation of above ligation products
Extraction of genome DNA from yeast cultured yesterday
PCR cloning of yeast parts from genomic DNA
ADH1 terminator
ADH2 promoter
CYC1 terminator
ENO2 promoter
SUC2 leader sequence
September 23 (Thu)
Gel electrophoresis of yesterday's PCR products followed by extraction
Restriction digest of PCR products with EcoRI, SpeI
ENO2, ADH2 incorrect length -> repeat
PCR cloning of ENO2 promoter, ADH2 promoter, glr (glutamate racemase)
Gel electrophoresis of crude PCR product, extraction & purification from gel
ENO2 promoter, ADH2 promoter, glr obtained!
PCR cloning of CelB, Man26B, Cel44A (Cel44A: internal mutations needed; 1st step of overlap extension fragment generation)
Gel electrophoresis of CelB, Man26B, Cel44A PCR products
(RESULTS?)
Miniprep of 006, 007 followed by restriction digest with EcoRI, SpeI
Gel electrophoresis of 006, 007
(RESULTS?)
Transfer to solution culture: 019, 020
no white/non-RFP colonies on 021 (pgsB) plate
insert (PCR product) was not digested properly?
problem with gel purification?
September 24 (Fri)
Inoculation of Karita-sensei's cellulase parts into fresh LB (need more plasmid); also, 024 (beta-glucosidase)
