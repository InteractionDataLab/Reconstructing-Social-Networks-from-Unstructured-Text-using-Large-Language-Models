Our Achievements
Using the iGEM 2010 Judging Form as a guide, we summarize our achievements below.
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Jamboree.
We had a great summer, and are looking forward to having fun at the Jamboree!!
Successfully complete and submit the iGEM 2010 Judging form.
Submitted!
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Done!
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Design of the poster is underway; the members are already practicing their presentations.
Enter information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Including:
Primary nucleaic acid sequence
Description of function
Authorship
Safety notes, if relevant.
Acknowedgment of sources and references
Please see our Parts page for a list of parts we designed or constructed.
Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry.
We submitted 12 new basic parts! (see our Favorite parts )
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device.
K392038 , K392039 , K392041 ; see documentation at Registry or the Tests page.
Enter this information and other documentation on both the iGEM 2010 wiki and the Registry.
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal:
Characterize or improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Registry.
We modified the cellulase parts K118023 and K118022 into K392006 and K392007 respectively. The new parts are Silver assembly-compatible and should make multi-domain cellulolytic enzymes easier to design.
We also characterized K118023 (CenA); info can be found at the Tests page.
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
ECUST Shanghai requested parts from our 2009 project, and we happily obliged by amplifying and sending those parts to them.
Develop and document a new technical standard that supports the:
design of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
sharing BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA, or via the Internet
BBF RFC 54 , a joint proposal with Edinburgh team for the elimination of the NotI sites from the BioBrick Prefix and Suffix.
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
Technically we did not come up with a new approach, but did conduct a joint Human Practices survey with various other Japanese teams on issues concerning biosafety and bioethics.
In summary, we fulfilled all the requirements to get a Gold Medal. We also
learned tons about Synthetic Biology,
had valuable hands-on experience with molecular biology lab experiments,
picked up some web-authoring skills like HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
interacted with teams from around the world, and
had a really great summer!
