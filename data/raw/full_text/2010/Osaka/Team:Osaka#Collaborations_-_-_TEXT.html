Participation in iGEM Japan
iGEM Japan is an alliance of Japanese iGEM teams conceived as a platform for enhancing communication and cooperation between teams, as well as collectively promoting iGEM in Japan. We participated in several meetings to discuss the direction, membership and activities of this group. Two of iGEM Japan's major activities this year were the iGEM Japan Meet-up and a comprehensive, nation-wide Human Practices survey. Please look at the result for further information.
Joint proposal for Request for Comments (RFC)
The iGEM teams of Osaka and Edinburgh encountered similar problems in designing PCR primers incorporating the standard BioBrick Prefix and Suffix. Together, we drafted and submitted a joint proposal for a Request for Comments which was accepted as BBF RFC 54 .
Help received from other teams
Edinburgh provided us with C. firmi beta-glucosidase part
New York provided us with yeast secretion tag and Aga2 display tag
Utah provided us with HlyA, TolA, Gene III tags
Our contributions
We helped the iGEM team of ECUST-Shanghai by sending them parts from our 2009 stock.
Acknowledgements
Professor Muranaka and all the members of Cell Tech Lab for lending us lab space and putting up with our intrusion
