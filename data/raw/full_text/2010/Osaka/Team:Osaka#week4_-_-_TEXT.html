August 16 (Mon)
Restriction digests
1-13D, 1-2M, 1-1D, 1-18F with EcoRI, PstI to check for point mutation(s) affecting XbaI site
2-20J with XbaI, PstI to check/confirm XbaI activity
Gel electrophoresis of digests
(RESULTS?)
Colony pick-up & transfer to solution culture (repeat; 2 each): 1-13D, 1-2M, 1-1D, 1-18F
3ml LB liquid medium; 3μl Amp or 0.6μl Kan solution added
August 17 (Tue)
Mini-prep of 1-13D, 1-2M, 1-1D, 1-18F parts inoculated yesterday (2 of each)
'Cut check' (restriction digest + gel electrophoresis to confirm insert) of the miniprepped parts:
1-1D, 1-18F with EcoRI, SpeI
1-13D, 1-2M with XbaI, PstI
(RESULTS?)
Transformation of secretion tag parts using 25μl of competent cells each(See Table 3)

August 18 (Wed)
iGEM Japan Meet-Up in Kyoto Attendance: Nakamura, Yasumoto, Saka, Kakuda
August 19 (Thu)
Transfer of 2-22P, 1-2J to solution culture
Gel electrophoresis of digests from 'cut check' products from Tuesday
repeat run, but each digest together with undigested plasmid DNA)
2% agarose gel instead of the usual 1%
(RESULTS?)
Gel electrophoresis of 1-1D digest only
(RESULT?)
Multiple restriction digests of 1-1D to check for problems at restriction sites
tried the following: EcoRI only; SpeI only; EcoRI + SpeI
Night: miniprep of 2-22P, 1-2J inoculated in the morning
August 20 (Fri)
Gel electrophoresis of 1-1D and its digests
(RESULTS?)
'Cut check' of parts miniprepped the night before
both 2-22P & 1-2J cut with XbaI, PstI
enzyme inactivation at 80°C, 20min
(RESULTS?)
Restriction digest of 2-20J (WHICH ENZYMES?)
Ligation according to 3A assembly method: 2-20J or 2-20H + 2-22P or 1-2J; 1-3A as vector
reaction mixture: 2μl of each plasmid, 2μl ligase buffer, 1μl T4 DNA ligase, water to make 20μl total
reaction at room temperature for 10min; ligase inactivation at 80°C for 20min
Transformation of ligated parts using 50μl of competent cells each; 2μl ligation product; 150μl Chloramphenicol spread on agar plates before inoculation with pre-incubation mix
August 21 (Sat)
Transfer of white (non-RFP) colonies from yesterday's transformation to 3ml LB liquid medium added with 1μl Cam solution
we later realized that the upstream and downstream parts had been mixed up in these ligations, so the ligation products (and these corresponding solution cultures) were discarded
3A assembly ligation: 1-1D as upstream, 1-2M as downstream, 1-3A as vector
ligation product designated as 001; Chloramphenicol resistance
same ligation mix composition as yesterday's
Transformation of 001 with pre-incubation for 1.5hr instead of 1hr
