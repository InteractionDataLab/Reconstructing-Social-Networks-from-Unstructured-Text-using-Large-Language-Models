Miniprep of 1-1C
Restriction digests of 2-20H, 2-20J, 1-1D, 1-18F, 1-1C, 1-13D, 1-2M
(WHICH ENZYMES?)
Gel electrophoresis of digests ("cut check")
2-20H, 2-20J, 1-1C -> OK
1-1D, 1-18F, 1-13D, 1-2M -> not cut (single band, MW approx. equal to vector + insert)
Transfer of 1-3A, 1-5A colonies to solution culture (repeat)
Yesterday's inoculated culture mediums contained the wrong antibiotics!
Transformation of <bbpart>BBa_I13521</bbpart>, <bbpart>BBa_I13522</bbpart>, <bbpart>BBa_I13600</bbpart>, <bbpart>BBa_K204031</bbpart>, <bbpart>BBa_K204051</bbpart>, <bbpart>BBa_K204032</bbpart> from last year's stock

so far all restriction digests involving XbaI seem to have failed; problem with enzyme stock?
will try with different set of restriction enzymes next week
Sent miniprepped last year's parts to ECUST team in Shanghai, China
