Abstract
iGEM Kyoto suggested a nationwide survey to all the iGEM teams in Japan this year.  Five Universities (including Kyoto) participated in this project.   We Kyoto team led other teams in the project, and successfully got over 1,500 answers in total!  From the survey, we found that opinions differ between students and non-students.   To our little surprise, the survey also showed that the majority of Japanese regard biotechnology favorably, while at the same time they worry very much about the safety.
Introduction
This year, we iGEM Japan carried out ”iGEM Japan Human Practices” suggested by iGEM Kyoto. In this project, we drove an attitude survey on genetic engineering and biotechnology cooperating with one another. We attempted to recognize the current situation of Japanese public view, and we will take advantage of this result for future human practice activities.
Motivation
According to the previous result of human practice activity, which was a survey with questions about genetic engineering, more Japanese people chose "negative" or "neutral" than the other nationalities [1] . In addition, it is often said that many Japanese people hate or avoid genetically modified food [2] . We are interested in this tendency. Thus, we attempted to investigate the reason why many Japanese people have a negative impression on genetic engineering. We made a questionnaire below, asking about the impressions on genetic engineering and words related to iGEM, or Synthetic biology.
Advantages
By combining the results from different teams located in the different regions to share some steps of human practice activities, we can avoid labor-intensive but also improve the quality of the survey result with rich amount of samples.
We can attract public attention such as Mass-media by driving this activity as iGEM Japan, than as one university team. This will be a great help for many purposes, such as announcing the activities of iGEM, inviting sponsors, or further human practices activities.
This project will be a good opportunity to deepen the relationships between each Japanese iGEMers. Actually, we are planning iGEM JAPAN project, which includes not only human practice activities but also construction of iGEM JAPAN Website, PR by magazines and participation in symposiums for example.

Methods
Five out of the nine Japanese teams, KIT-Kyoto , Kyoto , Osaka , Tokyo_Metropolitan , and UT-Tokyo took part in this project.  We all used paper-based questionnaires, but the sites for the survey and the terms used in the questions varied depending on the team.
The survey was conducted from June 30 to September 26 in places near our universities.

Questionnaire
We prepared two (very similar) questionnaires:  "Attitude survey of genetic engineering" and "Attitude survey of biotechnology."  They are almost the same, but "Attitude survey of biotechnology" contains a little different question from "Attitude survey of genetic engineering". We only changed the word "genetic engineering" of the survey for "biotechnology" in order to make "Attitude survey of biotechnology."
And we attempted to indicate difference of image between "genetic engineering" and "biotechnology".
Attitudes survey of ( genetic engineering  or  biotechnology )
When shopping, do you buy "non-genetically modified food”?
[ Always buy / Tend to buy / Hardly mind / Not mind / I have never seen such an indication ]

If there is no difference in effectiveness, what do you think about using the drugs manufactured by ( genetic engineering  or  biotechnology )?

Results
We drove this survey from July to September 26th.
All data: HumanPractice.xls
Our result is too much to write all on this page. So we write only graphs on this page and upload all result data. We analyzed mainly following points.
compare between arts and science(*) in college student
compare between "genetic engineering" and "biotechnology"
compare between people with different jobs
compare between college student and the others
(*)In Japan, classification of arts and science is important. Most Japanese students study different subjects since high school due to the classification, because it is a big factor to decide the subjects required in the entrance examination for universities or colleges. This is the reason we predicted that there might be some differences between arts and science.

Future work
We investigated the tendency of impressions on genetic engineering through comparison between Japanese (different ages, majors, job, and regions).We hoped that people became more familier  with synthetic biology.
