BBF RFC #: Novel Normalization Standard using Fluorescence

27th October 2010
1. Purpose
The Biotec_Dresden Team 2010 developed an approach where two fluorescent proteins are simultaneously expressed. The fact that one reporter, in our case RFP, is constitutively expressed allows to monitor cell growth. Secondly, an inducible promoter drives the expression of the second reporter, YFP in the case of the part tested. The constitutively expressed reporter protein (R1) serves as normalization factor for the inducible reporter (R2) by simple division.

4. Background
Performing kinetic measurements involving fluorescence in living cultures like bacteria requires the monitoring of growth generally performed using optical density (OD) measurements. These help to normalize the obtained fluorescent data and gain the actual values of fluorescence containing information about the actual cell number contributing to the overall fluorescence. To date this procedure is routinely followed.
5. Novel Approach
Instead of using OD measurements for normalization of fluorescent data R1 is introduced to the analyzed DNA construct containing inducible R2. Tests showed that this normalization standard is comparable and even more advanced than the routinely performed OD procedure.
6. Standard Procedure
Assemble R1 with the target construct using any of the mentioned BioBrick standard assemblies (Chapter 2) resulting in the following properties
R1 MUST be constitutively expressed
Both fluorescent reporters MUST NOT have an overlapping emission spectra
Both fluorescent reporters SHOULD NOT have an overlapping emission spectra
R2 SHOULD only be expressed upon desired induction
The complete construct MUST NOT include a negative feedback loop
R2 MUST NOT express a pigment
Promoter activity SHOULD be defined
