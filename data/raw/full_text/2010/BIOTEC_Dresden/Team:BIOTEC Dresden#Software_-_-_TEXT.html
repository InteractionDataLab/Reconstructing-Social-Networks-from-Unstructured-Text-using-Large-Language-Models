ApE
ApE was used as DNA construction software to create plasmid maps, fusion constructs and to view restriction sites of commonly used endonucleases
biologylabs.utah.edu/jorgensen/wayned/ape
NCBI Blast
The online software tool blast was used both to check nucleotide and protein sequences towards their homology to the original genomic sequence
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
Cell Designer
Cell Designer represents a tool for molecular modeling allowing to construct molecular circuits

PartsRegistry Sequence Analysis/BLAST
The registry blast was useful to identify nucleotide sequences already submitted to the registry
partsregistry.org/cgi/sequencing
PlasmaDNA
PlasmaDNA was used as a specific tool for the simulation of restriction digests as well as PCR reactions

Sequencher
Sequencer helped to analyze the sequencing results obtained
