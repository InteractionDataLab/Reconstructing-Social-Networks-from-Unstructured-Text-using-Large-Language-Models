(use this procedure only if your amplified DNA needs to be highly accurate (for downstream digestions, ligations, sequencing etc)
Reaction volume = 50μL, scale accordingly
Materials
sterile 0.2mL PCR strips or plates
ultra-pure water
5X HF Buffer
10mM dNTPs
forward primers
reverse primers
template DNA
Phusion Polymerase
Procedure
Everything on ice!
Prepare a Master Mix:
into a 1.5mL microfuge tube, add the following per 50 μL reaction:
38μL ultra pure water
10μL 5X HF Buffer
1μL 10mM dNTP
0.25μL forward primer
0.25μL reverse primer
0.5 μL Phusion
Pipet 1μL (usually) of your DNA template into a sterile 0.2mL PCR strip or plate
Note: also prepare
one or two extra reactions to allow for pipetting errors.
Vortex Mastermix and pulse spin down
Pipet 50μL of your Mastermix into PCR tube
Pulse spin PCR reactions using the PCR strip centrifuge (in Anni’s lab; front bench)
Set up PCR machine according to need (denaturation temperature, elongation time).
