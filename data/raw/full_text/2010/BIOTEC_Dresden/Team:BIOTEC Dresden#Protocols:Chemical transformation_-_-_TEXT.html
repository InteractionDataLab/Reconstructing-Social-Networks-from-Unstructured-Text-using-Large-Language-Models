Materials
Escherichia coli DH5 alpha chemical competent cells
1mL SOC (room temperature) for each reaction
Ice
Plasmid DNA
Heating block
1.5ml microfuge tube
LB-agar plate with corresponding antibiotic
Procedure
Chill DNA samples and tubes on ice.
Place LB-agar plates in 37°C incubator to warm.
Remove chemical competent cells from -80°C freezer and thaw on ice. Alternatively, freshly prepared chemical competent cells may be used immediately.
Dial a P2 pipetman to either 1 or 2μL depending on the salt content of your DNA sample. Use 2μL for samples that have been purified in some way.
Dial a P200 pipetman to 50μL or whatever volume of chemical competent cells you want to use; usually 20-50μL .
Pipet 1-2μL of DNA sample and add to chemical competent cells. Swirl tip around gently in cells to mix DNA and cells. Do not pipet up and down.
Place the mix back on ice for 30 mins.
Pulse the cells with a heat shock by placing the microfuge tubes in a heating block for 45 seconds at 42°C.
Place sample on ice for 2 mins and then add SOC medium. This step should be done as quickly as possible to prevent cells from dying off.
Chill sample on ice for 2 mins to permit the cells to recover.
Transfer eppendorf tube to 37°C incubator and shake to promote aeration. Incubate for 1 hr to permit expression of antibiotic resistance gene.
Plate transformation onto prewarmed LB-agar plate supplemented with appropriate antibiotic.
