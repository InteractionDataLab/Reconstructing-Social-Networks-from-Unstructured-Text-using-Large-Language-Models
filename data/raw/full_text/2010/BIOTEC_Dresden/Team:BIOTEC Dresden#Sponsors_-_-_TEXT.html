     Our project could not have reached this far without the help and support of numerous people. Our heartfelt thanks to BIOTEC and Technische Universität Dresden for sponsoring us, the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics(MPI-CBG), Dresden for providing us with the lab space and facilities to work.
We would like to thank everyone who supported us directly and indirectly; Andy Oates for his endless support, advice through out the project and for always telling us motivational stories that kept us going forward.
David Drechsler and his lab that provided us with plasmids and advised us on protein purification techniques. Dr. Prof.Bachmann for providing us with antibodies and advice on our project.
Annelie Oswald and Marko Storch, our wonderful supervisors who were there all the time for us, and who also helped in making the video.
Kaj Bernhardt and Johnson Madrid, for their support and scientific discussion during the phase of idea development.
Thanks to Raik Grünberg, Iva Tolic-Norrelykke, Carsten Werner, Mike Lorenz, Ralf Seidel,Eugene Petrov, Frank Gross, Stefan Grill and Pavel Tomancak for talks,discussions and feedbacks on our ideas.
The Electron Microscope Facility and crew at the Max Planck Institute, for giving us a wonderful and positive atmosphere to work in, especially Kimberly Moniker for letting us steal her pens. Our classmates for their support and keeping us entertained; Ignacio Gonzalez for his help on designs and Vishal Gupta for the photoshoot.
We thank Susan Fischer for organizing all the travel and supplies issues, Sylvia Clausing for helping us order the chemicals and lab equipments. Last but not least, we would like to thank  Prof. Petra Schwille for making all of this happen.
