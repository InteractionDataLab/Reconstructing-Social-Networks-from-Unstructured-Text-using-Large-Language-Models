Part BBa_K407014
This part was created by the team BIOTEC_Dresden 2010 as a detection device for AHL, which directly includes a normalization system. Basically, this part consists of the part BBa_I13263, in which LuxR is constitutively expressed. In the presence of AHL a LuxR-AHL complex is formed activating luxpR and thereby the expression of Yfp. Our team assembled the part BBa_J04450 to this part, which constitutively expresses RFP. Bacteria carrying this plasmid express RFP yet can after induction with AHL and LuxR additionally produce YFP. Both fluorescent signals are simultanously measured as the fluorescent spectra do not interfer. By dividing the fluorescent signal of Yfp by the fluorescent signal of RFP, one is able to normalize the fluorescence data without considering the cell density generally determined by OD measurements.
Results
Figure 1: The fluorescence of RFP is shown over increasing
AHL concentrations after 2 hours of incubation
Figure 1 shows the fluorescence signal of RFP plotted against an increasing AHL concentration. It can be seen that the signal intensity stays constant over the whole time.
Figure 2 displays the same data as Figure 1 except that the fluorescence of YFP is depicted. A logarithmic trend line can be fit to the data with a fair correlation. Interestingly, after normalizing the YFP data with the RFP data, simply by division, we are still able to fit the curve logarithmic. Hence the correlation improves remarkably through normalization, as displayed in Figure 3.

AHL concentrations after 2 hours of incubation
Figure 3: The fluorescence of YFP normalized by division through the fluorescence of
RFP is shown over increasing AHL concentrations after 2 hours of incubation
Figure 4 shows the normalized YFP fluorescence over time for different AHL concentrations. It can be seen that the rate of induction is determined by the AHL concentration and that even  concentration of only 50nM already leads to a significant increase in YFP fluorescence.

AHL concentrations ranging from 0 to 2000nM
Discussion:
The stagnation of the fluorescence signal of the RFP was not expected. Actually, it was considered to rise with the amount of bacteria as they divide during the measurement. The fact that the fluorescence does not increase during the measurement must mean that the cells are almost not dividing. Reasons for this phenomenon can be the environmental change as well as the elevated metabolic load caused by the production of the fluorescent proteins. Correspondingly, during the duration of the kinetic measurment the cell number stays constant.
The YFP signal depicted in Figure 2 on the other hand behaved as expected and shows the same behavior could already be detected for the part I13263.
The fact that the correlation coefficient R2 improves after the normalization of the fluorescence signal of YFP by division through those of RFP shows that the system our team created is funtional and is useful.
Figure 3 shows that, using this part for the detection of AHL and the novel normalization approach, a sensitive detection system is accomplished. Remarkably even lower concentrations, of 50nM, were detected using this approach compared to the traditional normalization procedure.
Materials and methods:
The characterization was performed using a 96-well plate and a fluorescence plate reader, which was kept at 37°C during the whole measurement.. Bacteria supplied with the part BBa_K407014 were suspended in medium of a certain concentration of AHL ranging from 0.01 to 2000nM. The fluorescence of both RFP and YFP was measured every 5 minutes. While for RFP an excitation wavelength of 562 nm and an emission wavelength of 612 nm were used, those for YFP were 485nm and 535nm respectively. As controls the optical density at 612nm and the RFP/YFP fluorescence of uninduced bacteria and LB-medium without cells were measured.
