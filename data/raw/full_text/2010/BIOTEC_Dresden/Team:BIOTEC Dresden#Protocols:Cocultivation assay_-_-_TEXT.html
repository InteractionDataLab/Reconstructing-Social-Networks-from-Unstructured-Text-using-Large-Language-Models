Set-up
Tecan plate reader
Start the machine 20 minutes in advance and heat the chamber to 37°C. Put in the plate and start the measurement with the following setting:
Measure OD at 612 nm
Measure fluorescence with an excitation wavelength of 485nm and an emission wavelength of 535nm for both GFP and YFP
Shake
Repeat measurements every 5min for 3 hours
Data processing
Normalize the data by dividing all fluorescence data by the corresponding optical density
Subtract the obtained value of the reference column from the calculated relative fluorescence of the wells containing HHL
Plot the fluorescence data over the time
