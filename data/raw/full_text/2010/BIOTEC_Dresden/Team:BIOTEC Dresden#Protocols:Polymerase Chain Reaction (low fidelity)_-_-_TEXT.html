Polymerase Chain Reaction (low fidelity)
Reaction volume = 50 μL, scale accordingly
Materials
sterile 0.2mL PCR strips or plates
ultra-pure water
10X Taq Buffer
10mM dNTPs
forward primers
reverse primers
template DNA
Taq Polymerase
Procedure
Everything on ice!
Prepare a Master Mix:
into a 1.5mL microfuge tube, add the following per 50 μL reaction:
37.5μL ultra pure water
5,5μL 10X Taq PCR Buffer
1,1μL 10mM dNTP
0.25μL forward primer
0.25μL reverse primer
0.5 μL Taq Polymerase
Note: also prepare one or two extra reactions to allow for pipetting errors.
Pipet 1μL (usually) of your DNA template into a sterile 0.2mL PCR strip or plate
Vortex Mastermix and pulse spin down
Pipet 50μL of your Mastermix into PCR tube
Pulse spin PCR reactions using the PCR strip centrifuge (in Anni’s lab; front bench)
Set up PCR machine according to need (denaturation temperature, elongation time).
