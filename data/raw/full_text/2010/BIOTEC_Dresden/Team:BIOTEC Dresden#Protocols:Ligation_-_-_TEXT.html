Hint
Try different molar ratios of vector to plasmid to increase ligation effficiency
The sticky ends of both the digested insert and vector DNA must be comptabile
Materials
ultra-pure water
purified digested insert DNA
purified digested vector DNA
10X T4 DNA ligase buffer
T4 DNA ligase
Procedure
How to calculate the Insert Amount, if, for example, a 6:1 molar ratio is decided upon
Into a 1.5mL add the following:
2.0µL 10X T4 DNA Ligase Buffer
volume of insert that corresponds to the determined molar ratio
volume of vector that corresponds to the determined molar ratio
0.5µL T4 DNA Ligase
Adjust final volume to 20µL with ultra pure water
Vortex and pulse spin down
Incubate at room temperature for 1 hour
