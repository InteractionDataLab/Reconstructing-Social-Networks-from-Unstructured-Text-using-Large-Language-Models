Raphaël
Restriction digest 2h, 37°C (10µL of minipreped DNA)
BBa_J23119 cut by SpeI + PstI
BBa_J23110 cut by SpeI + PstI
BBa_J37033 cut by XbaI + PstI
BBa_R0062 cut by SpeI + PstI
BBa_E0240 cut by XbaI + PstI
Raphaël and Léa
DNA Gel electrophoresis (agarose 1,0% w/v) (gel extraction for purification of DNA)
After migration, we made a bath with EtBr during 5-10 min.
Protocol (6 wells)
10 µL of ladder 1Kb
17 µL of digested DNA (J23119 - SpeI+PstI) + 3 µL of loading buffer 6x
17 µL of digested DNA (J23110 - SpeI+PstI) + 3 µL of loading buffer 6x
17 µL of digested DNA (R0062 - SpeI+PstI) + 3 µL of loading buffer 6x
17 µL of digested DNA (E0240 - XbaI+PstI) + 3 µL of loading buffer 6x
17 µL of digested DNA (J37033 - XbaI+PstI) + 3 µL of loading buffer 6x
Migration : 50V, 1h30

double digestion of J37033 (LuxR) failed.
Gel extraction - Kit Qiagen
Ligation (T4 ligase), 1h at room temperature
vector : R0062 (Plux) cut by SpeI + PstI
insert : E0240 (RBS+GFP+ter) cut by XbaI + PstI
Transformation
Transformation into TOP10 - pSB AmpR with biobricks - Plating 100µL of each on the plates (Amp) - Incubation overnight :
Product of ligation (R0062+E0240)
-> Transformation didn't work
Restriction digest 1h, 37°C (10µL of minipreped DNA)
Again because the double digestion of J37033 didn't work and we have forgotten to digest 2 other biobricks
BBa_J23119 cut by SpeI + PstI
BBa_J23110 cut by SpeI + PstI
BBa_J37033 cut by XbaI + PstI
BBa_R0062 cut by SpeI + PstI
BBa_E0240 cut by XbaI + PstI
BBa_K081008 cut by SpeI + EcoRI
BBa_B0015 cut by EcoRI + XbaI
DNA Gel electrophoresis (agarose 1,0% w/v) (gel extraction for purification of DNA)
After migration, we made a bath with EtBr during 5-10 min.
Protocol (6 wells)
10 µL of ladder 1Kb
17 µL of digested DNA (J37033 - XbaI+PstI) + 3 µL of loading buffer 6x
17 µL of digested DNA (B0015 - EcoRI+XbaI) + 3 µL of loading buffer 6x
17 µL of digested DNA (K081008 - SpeI+EcoRI) + 3 µL of loading buffer 6x
Migration : 50V, 1h

double digestion of J37033 (LuxR) failed again !
Gel extraction - Kit Qiagen
Ligation (T4 ligase), overnight in cold water
vector : K081008 (LuxI) cut by SpeI + EcoRI
insert : B0015 (ter) cut by EcoRI + XbaI
Aleksandra
Transformation
Transformation into TOP10 - Plating 100µL of each on the plates (Amp) - Incubation overnight :
Product of ligation (attC+ter+attC+mRFP)
-> Transformation didn't work, the product of ligation is Kanamycin resistant NOT Ampicillin resistant !!!
DNA Gel electrophoresis (agarose 1,0% w/v) (control of the ligation)
2 µL of EtBr was added in the gel
Protocol (6 wells)
3 µL of ladder 1Kb + T4 ligase (incubation 1h at room temperature)
3 µL of ligation control 1 (vector only) + 3 µL of loading buffer 2x
3 µL of ligation control 2 (vector + ligase) + 3 µL of loading buffer 2x
7 µL of ladder 1Kb
3 µL of ligation product (1 µL) non digested + 3 µL of loading buffer 2x
3 µL of ligation product (1 µL) non digested + 3 µL of loading buffer 2x
Migration : 50V, 30 min
