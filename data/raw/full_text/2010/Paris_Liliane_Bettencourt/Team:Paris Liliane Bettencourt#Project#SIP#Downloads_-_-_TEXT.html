SIP Database
SIP words database 2007 (SQLITE3)
SIP words database 2008 (SQLITE3)
SIP words database 2009 (SQLITE3)
To read databases, use sqlite3 .
Warning : Notice these files are generated using "links -dump" to remove html, to speed the process, but you can do without that, because SIP will remove them later. With links, some pages with special characters like '(' ')' and ':' in their name are not converted, we consider it's not very important, because it's a small number of pages, but you can re-gen the database without the html parse step.
You can also use html2text, but if the software find special character, it don't remove the html.
Notes about filters : In these files, there're no filters but you can make what you want : remove common name, keep only MeSH terms etc. See what you need!
