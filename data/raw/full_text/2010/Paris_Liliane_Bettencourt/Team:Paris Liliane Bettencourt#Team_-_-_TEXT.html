Our lab
Located 5 minutes walk from the Luxembourg Gardens at the Paris Descartes Medicine Faculty in Cochin, the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity CRI was founded in 2005 as a convivial place at the crossroad between Life Sciences and exact, natural, cognitive and social sciences. Our environment includes a fully-equipped seminar room, a meeting room, office space for visiting professors, a library and coffee rooms and a modelling as well as wet-lab space. The CRI supported its students over three years ago to form the first French team to the iGEM and the tradition is continuing... This is where all happened!
Our Student Team
Hi! This is our iGEM team. We are 8 undergrad students from different disciplines who have worked together over this summer to design, build and test the counting bacteria. We also had great instructors and supervisors who helped us a lot with their advise and experience. It was a great group work experience, we've learned a lot and also had fun! Everyone had a chance to work on all parts of the project, but we divided the responsibilities for different aspects among our team members.

Yifan Yang
1st year PhD student, FdV program : TaMaRa lab, Cochin lab
iGEM Peking 2007 team member. Yifan co-founded both the Peking University iGEM society and one of the first iGEM teams of China, which won the 2007 iGEM Grand Prize. Yifan's research interests involve the general quantitative features of ageing and the evolution of it, the role of phenotypic variability in evolution, and microbial physiology and ecology.

Our Supervisor
Ariel Lindner
Co-initiator of the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity (cri-paris.org), Ariel is an INSERM tenured senior researcher and director of the Interdisciplinary Approaches to Life Sciences ('AIV') master program at the Paris Descartes and Diderot Universities. Ariel has graduated from the Hebrew University (Jerusalem, Israel) "Amirim" interdisciplinary program with major in Chemistry and received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the Weizmann Institute of Science (Rehovot, Israel) in Chemical Immunology for his work on catalytic antibodies as enzyme models, antibody conformational changes and directed evolution. After a research period at the Scripps Institute (California, USA), he received EMBO and Marie Curie fellowships to pursue postdoctoral work in Paris. His study interests evolve around applying Physical, Chemical and Biological approaches to study aging and variability between clonal individuals. Ariel has been leading the Paris iGEM team since its conception over four years ago and cannot wait to bring another trophy home...
