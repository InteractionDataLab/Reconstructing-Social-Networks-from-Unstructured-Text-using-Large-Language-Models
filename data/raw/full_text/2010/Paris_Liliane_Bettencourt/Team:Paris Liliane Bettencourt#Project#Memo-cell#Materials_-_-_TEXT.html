Construction of the test for transposase
We have designed and then send to synthesis the different arms (wild-type and mutant) of the transposon. We then integrate between this arms the cassette for Kanamycine resistance and LacZ. Once this construction obtain we put it on the chromosome thanks to a plasmid with pir dependent origin of replication and transform the plasmid carrying Pbad Int Xis Tn916. The last part was to induce the transposase.
