• Fondation Bettencourt Schueller
The Fondation Bettencourt Schueller (FBS) was created by Mrs Liliane Schueller Bettencourt and her family, in the memory of her father Eugene Schueller, founder of L’Oréal. It helps to initiate, support and develop projects in the biomedical, cultural and humanitarian fields.The FBS has generously supported our team ever since its conception over four years ago.  The foundation is active in the following areas:
• Biomedical research : The foundation supports  research through two types of actions : prizes and fellowships for young and established talented researchers and through the support of research education, as the French MD/PhD program “Ecole INSERM – Liliane Bettencourt”, the Intersdisciplinary Approaches to Life Sciences master program and the Frontiers of Life Sciences Liliane Bettencourt PhD program).
• Culture : The foundation supports talented artists or craftsmen and attempts to make known or to acknowledge works of great quality, whether from the past or present.
• Social/humanitarian relief : It really important for the Foundation to provide help for associations that are engaged in social and humanitarian actions. Through these, it contributes to relieve particularly difficult situations and to give new opportunities to children and adults in adversity.
• Embassy of France in the United States.
• The CRI
The Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI) was our home in the past months, It provided us with a friendly and intensive scientific atmosphere and physical location to brainstorm, define and concretize our project as well as lab facilities, fournished by the FBS, within the Evolutionary Systems Biology team of the U1001 INSERM Unit. Special thanks  to Mrs. Chantal Lotton , Dr. Mia Stafa, Dr. Ming Ni and the ensemble of  Tamara's lab for their daily support! Special thanks go to Mrs. Laura  Ciriani and Miss Celine Guerigues for their friendly administrative help and guidance!
