DNA precipitation in the gel extraction samples K081008 (RBS+LuxI) and R0062 (pLux) (concentration of the samples in DNA)
Initial volume : 50 µL ; Final volume : 5 µL
Protocol
Add 0.1 volumes of 3M Sodium Acetate solution to 1 volume of DNA sample.
Add 1ul Glycogen to the DNA sample.
Add 2 volumes of 95% EtOH to the DNA Sample.
Store the solution for 30 minutes at -80°C.
Centrifuge the solution at maximum speed for least 15 minutes.
Decant and discard the supernatant.
Air-dry the pellet for 10-15 minutes at room temperature until all liquid is gone.
Resuspend in desired volume of water or buffer
Gel electrophoresis (agarose 1,0% w/v, EtB) (check the presence of DNA in the concentrated gel extraction samples)
Protocol (5 wells)
10 µL of ladder 1Kb (new ladder)
nothing
5 µL of concentrated gel extraction sample (K081008 (RBS+LuxI)) + 1 µL of loading buffer 6x
nothing
5 µL of concentrated gel extraction sample (R0062 (pLux)) + 1 µL of loading buffer 6x

There's no DNA visible in the gel ! (a negligible amount of DNA in our gel extraction samples or no DNA at all ?)
