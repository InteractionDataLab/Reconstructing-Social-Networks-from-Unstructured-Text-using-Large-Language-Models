Shaun Christopher Burd is a final year chemical engineering student at the University of the Witwatersrand. Academically, he is an excellent student and is consistently at the top of his class.  He has won several awards and prizes for his academic achievements.  He is very enthusiastic about engineering and is very mathematically inclined. In 2008 he served as class representative and was vice chairperson for the student representative council for the department of engineering.  After graduating, Shaun hopes to pursue post-graduate studies in either control engineering or biotechnology.  In the summer vacations at the end of 2008 and 2009, he worked at the National Laser Centre of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Pretoria. For his final year chemical engineering research project, he will be investigating the application of Kalman filters for the control of generic chemical processes.  In his free time, Shaun enjoys playing guitar, reading and playing sports.
