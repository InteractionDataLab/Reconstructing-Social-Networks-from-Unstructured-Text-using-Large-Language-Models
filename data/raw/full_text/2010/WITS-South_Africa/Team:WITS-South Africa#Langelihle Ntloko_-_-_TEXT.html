Biography- Langelihle “Caleb” Ntloko Langelihle (or Caleb/Langa as some may know him) has been an all-rounder for most of his life. He shares a passion for Science, sport and ministry. He obtained his B. Sc degree from Witwatersrand University in R.S.A and is currently completing his honours degree at the same institution. Langelihle is part of the Wits-R.S.A team that is to compete at this year’s competition in Boston Massachusetts. He is a sports fanatic; he participated in rugby, cricket and athletics in High School and obtained provincial colours in all 3 disciplines. Sport has taken a back-seat in his life now and only plays for the Wits Engineers Rugby team (they are the defending champions). He is a Christian with impeccable qualities and as his nick-name (Caleb) suggests; he shows a positive outlook on life and places his current successes on God and his faithfulness. He leads his church's youth worship team where he plays lead guitar. His hobbies apart from sport and music are fooling around in laboratory with his mates’ bac-and-teria; collecting top music pieces. Science has always intrigued him and being part of this IGEM competition has become an exciting adventure for him.As young as he is (or isn’t), he shows great promise and is confident that the Wits-RSA team will do extremely well in the competition and will prove to be a stepping stone for each of the team members in their respective fields.  Oh, did I mention he’s handsome... He often wonders the halls of his campus preying on beautiful women with his suave and bedroom eyes so if you are a promising bacteria loving girl,and If you just happen to read this and you're confident you'll fit me like a glove...Drop me an email
