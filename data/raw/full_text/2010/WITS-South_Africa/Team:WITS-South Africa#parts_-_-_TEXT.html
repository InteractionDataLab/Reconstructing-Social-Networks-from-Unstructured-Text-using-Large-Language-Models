Mission Statement
Here at WITS, we’re serious about our synthetic biology; we like knowing that when you shove your (nitrile-gloved) hand into our box of bio bits you emerge with a fully-functional nut for your bolt.  So, hence, therefore, as a result we have decided to provide the entire life cycle of our BioBricks - over and above their behavioral characterization. From their genesis to gene synthesis, we’re giving you it all: snapshots of their sequences to our many guesses at their gels. Finally, you can rest assured that they sit happy in their bubble-wrapped plasmid packaging as we submit them off into the great lake of science - The Registry.
