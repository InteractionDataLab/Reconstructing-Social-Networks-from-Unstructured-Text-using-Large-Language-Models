Byron is the team glue, binding the team into a cohesive unit serving as a social lubricant while keeping up with the Modelling. Byron has a somewhat unhealthy love for Mathematics. This started in High School probably through sheer boredom, it grew and inspired him to complete a BSc degree in Computation and Applied Mathematics. This year he furiously pursuing his Honours in Applied Maths.
Byron likes to keep people in good moods and loves to laugh. He also enjoys making music through a variety of instruments and is not fond of writing bio's, hence this is written in the third person.
