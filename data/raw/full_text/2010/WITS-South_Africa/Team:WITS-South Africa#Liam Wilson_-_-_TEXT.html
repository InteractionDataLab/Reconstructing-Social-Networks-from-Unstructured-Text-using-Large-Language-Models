Hi there,
My name is Liam Wilson. I am currently studying philosophy. I am the only BA student on the team. In terms of philosophy, I am very interested in epistemology, logic and philosophy of science.
I am an extremely dedicated tracuer, that is a practitioner of parkour, and an avid road runner. I hope to run in the comrades marathon next year. I also brew my own beer and, time allowing, hope to sample some of Boston's finest beers.
