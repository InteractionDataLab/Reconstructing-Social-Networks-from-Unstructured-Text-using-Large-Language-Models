Our team consists of students from various disciplines such as molecular biology, mathematics, engineering and philosophy. Whilst the biologists will focus on building the machine in the wetlab, the mathematicians and engineers will model its predicted behaviour and effect in vivo whilst the philosopher will focus on the ethics of creating such a machine for medical application.

Where we're from
The iGEM team is made up of students and lecturers from various faculties from the University of the Witwatersrand. Situated in Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa, Wits (as it is affectionately called) boasts a wide array of activities and achievements. Check out the promotional video to get a feel for the Wits way of life.

A small portion of the team comes from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) situated in the city of Pretoria, a mere 50km north of Johannesburg. The CSIR Biosciences division is participating in this competition. The CSIR overview can be seen in the link below as well as the overview for the biosciences division itself.
