</LI><LI>The OD600 was 0.651 which was low, but used in order to speed up the experiment. 
</LI><LI>The PMKV005 loxKanlox Plasmid (McCusker 2005 Yeast, 21: 163-171) was used into transform wildtype yeast.  
</LI><LI>The plates used were Kan positive plates created on 6/24.  
</LI><LI>However it was later found that these plates might not correctly select for drug resistance.  
</LI><LI>Two plates were made, one with the transformant and one with a control.

</LI><LI>Two colonies had grown on the Sample plate and none showed on the control plate.  
</LI><LI>The low colony number could be due to a low OD600 (0.651) used in the transformation.

</LI><LI>Brian: The FY5 freezer stock was accidentally allowed to thaw and therefor a second freezer stock was started by growing an overnight culture inoculated from the original freezer stock.  
</LI><LI>The freezer stock was made according to protocol from the cohen lab.

</LI><LI>A freezer stock of FY4 was made according to protocol from an overnight culture of the FY4 strain since the original stock was destroyed when plating on 7/12.
</LI></UL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="2010.2F07.2F14">2010/07/14</SPAN></H2><UL><LI>Yeast colonies were observed on the FY4 plated on 7/12 from the FY4 freezer stock. This plate was brought to the Cohen lab along with liquid YPD-4 and they were used to inoculate a 5ml overnight culture.
</LI></UL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="2010.2F07.2F15">2010/07/15</SPAN></H2><UL><LI>Yeast Transformation
</LI><LI>Alice and Brian went to the Cohen Lab to preform a yeast transformation. 
</LI><LI>Ilaria showed us how to use the nano-drop using the following procedure:
</LI></UL><PRE>1.	Wipe the nanodrop with a kim-wipe
2.	Click the shortcut on the computer that is identicle to the logo on the nano drop
3.	Choose Nucleic Acid in the program
4.	Put on 1 μL of dH2O to clean it
5.	Cleantop and bottem with kim wipe
6.	Put on 1 μL of blank 
7.	Clean with Kim wipe
8.	Put on 1 μL of plasmid
9.	Make sure sample type is set to DNA 50
</PRE><UL><LI>Looked at the graph, a spike at 130 is due to salts, a spike at 260 is due to DNA, a spike at 280 is due to protein. *Record the 260/230 ratio and 260/280 ratios, you want then both to be above 1, somewhere between 1-2 is good
</LI><LI>A DNA concentration of ~1ng/ μL was measured which is extremely low, and therefor the plasmid should not be used to preform a yeast transformation. 
</LI><LI>This could be a poissible explination for the extremely low transformation efficiency of Transformation-1. 
</LI><LI>Because of this it is necessary to amplify the plasmid in <I>E. coli</I>.
</LI><LI>Amplification of PMKV005
</LI><LI>The PMKV005 was to be amplified in <I>E. coli</I> to increase its concentration. 
</LI><LI>Vorachek-Warren et. al. 2004 showed that PMKV005 was derived from the pAG26 plasmid which had ampicillin resistance.
</LI><LI>The competent cells were obtained from NEB thawed on ice and transformed with the following protocol.
</LI></UL><PRE>1.	Pipette 1 μL of plasmid into the cells. Flick the tubes very gently;
2.	Let them site on ice for 10 minutes;
3.	heat shock at 42 degC for 45 seconds;
4.	Return tubes on ice;
5.	add 250 μL SOC media (LB works too but SC was used);
6.	grow cells at 37 degC 225 rpm for 1 hour; Placed in incubator directly to the left of the shaker in the cohen  lab
7.	Plate 50 μL on a antibiotic resistant plate (which you have warmed up with the lid slightly open for about 20  minutes);
8.	incubate overnight at 37 degC.

</PRE><UL><LI>Our first round of Kan Plates were used to plate the colonies.
</LI></UL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="2010.2F07.2F20">2010/07/20</SPAN></H2><UL><LI>Attempted to conduct a transformation back at our lab.  
</LI><LI>However we were unable to get an OD600 reading.  
</LI><LI>The nano-drop gave inconsistent and negligible results.  
</LI><LI>Using a spectrophotometer an OD of just 0.004 was recorded, on two separate trials. 
</LI><LI>The following procedure was used for the spectrophotometer. 
</LI><LI>An o/n culture of the FY4 strain plated on 7/12 was made.
</LI></UL><PRE>1. Turn on the instrument by rotating the 0%T dial clockwise.
You should hear it click when it turns on.
2. Allow the spec to warm up for at least 15 minutes.
Given the long warm up time we will likely be leaving this device on during periods of heavy use.
3. After the warm-up period, set the wavelength to 600 nm (top knob). 
4. Set the filter lever to the appropriate position for the selected wavelength (bottom).
5. Press the MODE button until the display mode is set to FACTOR.
6. Using the INCREASE/DECREASE buttons ensure that the factor is set to 1.0.
7. Press the MODE button until the display mode is set to TRANSMITTANCE.
8. With no cuvette in the holder and the lid closed, turn the 0%T knob until the measured transmittance is 0.0. 
   This is zeroing the device.
9. Fill a cuvette with 3.0 mL of the medium used to grow the cells (e.g. YPD) and wipe the sides with a KimWipe to eliminate fingerprints and dust particles.
10. Place the cuvette in the compartment.
11. Align the guide mark of the cuvette with the guide mark on the compartment.
12. Close the lid of the compartment.
13. Adjust the TRANSMITTANCE to 100.0 using the 100%T knob (right).
    This is essentially the equivalent of when you TARE a balance.
14. Remove the sample.
    You may choose to leave this cuvette of YPD for other users as they will likely be performing the same procedure.     
    Note: the spectrophotometer must be blanked for each user even if a common cuvette is being used.
15. In a new cuvette add 3.0 mL of your cell culture sample.
16. Wipe the cell with a KimWipe and insert into the compartment as in Step 10. 
17. Record the value shown in the data display (make sure MODE is ABSORBANCE).
    Absorbance is a synonym for OD (optical density).
18. When all measurements are obtained, turn the O%T (left knob) counterclockwise to switch the spec off.
19. Clean your cuvettes thoroughly and dry them completely.

</LI><LI>Spectrophotometer gave a reading of 1.220
</LI><LI>Nano drop gave readings of .282, 0.347, 0.360
</LI></UL><LI>The nanodrop has a 1mm pathlength while the spectrophotometer has a 1 cm pathlength so there is an expected factor of 10 difference
</LI><LI>We later became aware that the spectrophotometer cannot measure saturated cultures accurately so we conducted a more thorough experiment.  
</LI><LI>The culture was diluted 5 fold and the absorbance of both the saturated and diluted cultures were measured.
