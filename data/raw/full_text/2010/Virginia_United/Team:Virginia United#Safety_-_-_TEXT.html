Virginia United
All students in the Virginia United regional iGEM team  received biosafety training at the iGEM boot camp and signed safety contracts.
VT/BSC subteam
Students attended Virginia  Bioinformatics Institute’s mandatory Student  Groups Health & Safety Orientation.
Students received ethidium  bromide training from Virginia Bioinformatics Institute to ensure safe handling  and disposal of this chemical.
The subteam worked in a  BSL-1 laboratory which met practices, safety equipment, and facility  requirements for this biosafety level.
Students were supervised at  all times in the lab by a faculty advisor with microbiology experience and  considerable laboratory safety training. In addition, a molecular biologist and  laboratory manager at Virginia Bioinformatics Institute and a laboratory  manager at Fralin Biotechnology Center provided safety counseling.
All subteam members were  provided Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – laboratory coats, gloves, and  safety goggles. PPE was used appropriately. Team members were required to wear  appropriate clothing in the lab - no open toed shoes and no clothing above the  knee were permitted.
No food or beverages were  permitted in the lab.
Biohazard waste was  properly handled and was autoclaved on a regular basis.
Material Safety Data Sheets  (MSDSs) were reviewed before chemicals were used. Chemicals were handled  according to MSDS instructions. A fume hood was used to perform work involving  volatile chemicals.
Hazardous chemical waste  was labeled and stored properly. This waste was picked up by Environmental  Health Safety Services for proper disposal.
Flammables were stored in a  flammables cabinet.
Bunsen burners were turned  off when not in use.
The laboratory facility was  cleaned daily and kept organized.
University of Virginia team
