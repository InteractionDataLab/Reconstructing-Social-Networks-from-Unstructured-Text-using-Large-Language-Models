Where we're from
Virginia United is a regional team between Virginia Tech, University of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Bluefield State College, and Virginia State University. The team members spent their summer spread between labs at Virginia Tech, University of Virginia, and Virginia Commonwealth University working towards a common project.
Regional Team
The Virginia United Team was created as a collaborative effort between five schools, University of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Bluefield State College, and Virginia State University. We divided up and worked on separate parts of the project in three different locations in the state and maintained communication through constant emails, Skype calls, and face to face regional meetings.  Collaboration for a project of this magnitude with this many people was in itself an experimental endeavor that challenged us to develop a project and maintain strong communication and organizational skills that are vital to the interdisciplinary component of synthetic biology.  Not only did each individual offer a unique perspective to the team, but each university, based on access to variable resources and instruments, provided different approaches and angles to completing our project.  Perhaps one of the most vital components of this project was learning how to work together as a team in a research environment.  Having gained a better understanding of how research can be conducted in a multi-institutional setting has provided us with an experience that will be instrumental for development of our futures in research and beyond.  As collaborative efforts between universities, states, and even countries becomes a normal part of the research world, our team members are now better equipped to handle and solve future scientific problems.
Collaborations with Other Teams
We helped the software team create a program that can analyze a construct's DNA sequence and design oligo primers that can be used for USER fusion.  Our team helped by explaining how USER fusion works, explaining optimal length of primers, and explaining optimal melting temperatures for the primers.  USER fusion is a method for splicing together long strands of DNA and is convenient for construct assembly.
VA United Boot Camp
In order to become acquainted with the members of each sub team, the Virginia United team held a "boot camp" at the beginning of the summer starting June 1 and ending on June 4.  In addition to getting to know one another the team also discussed an overview of our project.  To bring each team member up to speed in the field of synthetic biology, daily laboratory projects were planned including construct assembly, screening, and analysis.  Each day, guest speakers, including advisors from each institution, lectured on important points in the growing field of synthetic biology and instilled excitement in all the students.  The FBI visited the Virginia United students to lecture on safety and discretion while participating in research and provided a workshop to help conceptualize their lecture’s importance.  In summary, the boot camp provided an exciting environment for team bonding and offered an environment conducive for thinking and learning.

Assembling
The goal is to assemble a simple device using BioBricks. Since we only have 1 week, the BioBrick parts have already been transformed and grown on plates. During the week, students will start liquid cultures for each part, miniprep the plasmids, digest the plasmids, ligate the digested DNA, transform the assembled device, grow the new cells, and measure their results.
The device contains three BioBrick parts: a TetR generator (BBa_I732084), a Ptet controlled GFP (BBa_I13522), and a vector expressing RFP (BBa_J04450). The TetR generator expresses the TetR transcription factor, which represses the Ptet promoter. The inducer aTc can be added to the growth media and block TetR from repressing the Ptet promoter. Thus, the Ptet controlled GFP will show a response in GFP level based on the presence or absence of aTc. The RFP expressing vector provides a positive control for the assembly because those vectors that do not properly digest can be identified by their expression of RFP, which can be seen by eye.

Not only did we have the opportunity to meet all the team members at the boot camp, but we also learned a lot of important elements that helped us throughout the summer.  Each speaker helped us understand a different aspect of the field, and each day we worked in the lab we became more familiar with the techniques that we were using throughout the summer.
