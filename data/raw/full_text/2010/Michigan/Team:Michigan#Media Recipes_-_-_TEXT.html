General Recipes
LB media
10 g LB medium
500 mL DI water
autoclave to sterilize
LB media with agar
10 g LB medium
7.5 g agar
500 mL DI water
autoclave to sterilize
add antibiotics after autoclaving when warm to touch (about 50°C)
pour plates when warm to the touch (about 50°C)
0.1 M CaCl2 solution
0.735 g of CaCl2*2 H20
50 mL of DI water
filter sterilize
1.0 M CaCl2 solution
7.35 g of CaCl2*2 H20
50 mL of DI water
filter sterilize
1.0 M MgSO4
12.323 g of MgSO4*7 H20
50 mL of DI water
filter sterilize
Ampicillin Antibiotic Stock Solution (100 mg/mL)
1 g of ampicillin
5 mL of DI water
5 mL of ethanol
filter sterilize and make 1 mL aliquotes to store in the -20°C freezer
Kanamycin Antibiotic Stock Solution (50 mg/mL)
250 mg of kanamycin
5 mL of DI water
filter sterilize and make 1 mL aliquots to store in the -20°C freezer
Tetracycline Antibiotic Stock Solution (50 mg/mL)
250 mg of tetracycline
2.5 mL of DI water
2.5 mL of ethanol
filter sterilize and make 1 mL aliquots to store in the -20°C freezer
IPTG stock solution (1 M)

1049 uL of DI water
filter sterilize with .22 um filter
40% glucose solution
20 g of glucose
50 mL of DI water
filter sterilize
0.1 M NaOH solution
BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN MIXING! SOLID NaOH BURNS YOUR SKIN BUT YOU MAY NOT FEEL IT AT FIRST! MAKE SURE ANY SPILLS ARE CLEANED UP VERY WELL!
0.2 g of NaOH
50 mL of sterile water
Filter Sterilize
10mM dNTP mix for PCR
MAKE SURE ALL REAGENTS ARE WELL MIXED BEFORE STARTING BY PULSE CENTRIFUGING OR FLICKING
100 uL of 100mM dATP
100 uL of 100mM dTTP
100 uL of 100mM dGTP
100 uL of 100mM dCTP
600 uL of ultra pure water
aliquot into 50 uL volumes (this will take 20 1.5mL eppendorf tubes)
Oil Sands Recipes
1.5 mg/mL Cyclohexanecarboxylic acid solution
Cyclohexanecarboxylic acid is volatile and should only be used under a hood.  For accurate measurement, use a covered scale with sliding doors (in the hood).  Store in the corrosive cabinet.
0.075 g cyclohexanecarboxylic acid
50 mL of DI water
filter sterilize
Bushnell-Haas Salts (w/out carbon source)
0.4 g of KH2PO4
0.4 g of K2HPO4
0.4 g of (NH4)2 SO4  or NH4NO3
0.002 g of FeCl3
318 mL of DI H2O
Autoclave at 15 psi and 121°C for 30 minutes
After the media has cooled completely add:
665 uL of 1 M MgSO4 solution
72 uL of 1 M CaCl2 solution
Bushnell-Haas Media with glucose
39.75 mL of Bushnell-Haas Salts
2 mL of 40% glucose solution
8.25 mL of sterile DI water
Bushnell-Haas Media with cyclohexanecarboxylic acid
39.75 mL of Bushnell-Haas Salts
4 mL of cyclohexanecarboxylic acid solution
6.25 mL of sterile DI water
20 mg/mL Casamino Acid Solution
0.18 g Casamino acid
9 mL of DI water
Filter sterilize
Bushnell-Haas Media with glucose and casamino acids
39.75 mL of Bushnell-Haas Salts
2 mL of 40% glucose solution
2 mL of sterile DI water
6.25 mL of casamino acid solution
Bushnell-Haas Media with cyclohexanecarboxylic acid adjusted to pH of 9
39.75 mL of Bushnell-Haas Salts
4 mL of cyclohexanecarboxylic acid solution
6.25 mL of sterile DI water
Test how much 0.1 M NaOH must be added to 1 mL of media to raise it to a pH of 9 (add 1 uL of base at a time)
Scale up the amount of  0.1 M NaOH solution to add to the remaining volume of media (approaching final amount slowly)
On 8/3/2010, approximately 20 uL of 0.1 M NaOH had to be added to 1 mL to get to a pH between 8 and 9 (tested with pH paper) and 675 uL of 0.1 M NaOH was added into the 45 mL of remaining media.
