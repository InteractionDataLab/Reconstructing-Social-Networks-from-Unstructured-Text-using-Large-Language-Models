Our goal in this part of the project is to increase the H2  production by modifying the carbon flow through the pathway of the mixed acid  fermentation (MAF). The pathways of this fermentation are quite simple.  Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which is produced by the glycolysis, is transformed  into pyruvate or into oxaloacetate. Those two molecules are then transformed  into several products after a chain of reactions. Hydrogen is one of those  products. It is produced from formate to regulate the intracellular pH of the  bacteria <A href="#R1">[1]</A>.</P><P>Here is a simplified global overview  of the mixed acid fermentation (fig.1):</P><DIV align="center"><TABLE border="0" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD align="center"><P><LEG>Fig. 1 : Mixed acid fermentation pathway <A href="#R2">[2]</A>.</LEG></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P> Each reaction is controlled by  one or several enzymes.

The hydrogen is produced from formate by the formate hydrogenase lyase system (FHL), an intracellular membrane-bound complex composed of the formate dehydrogenase (FDHH) and the hydrogenase 3 
<A href="#R1">[1]</A>. This complex catalyzes the following reaction:</P><P align="center">

Several steps of the MAF pathway are irrelevant for hydrogen production (fig. 2). To inactivate these reactions, the genes encoding enzymes that catalyze these reactions have to be deleted using the technique described in the homologous recombination module.
After exhaustive analyzes of the literature, we decided which genes we would overexpress and which we would disrupt. 
Here is the list of all the genes that we planned to delete. By using the KEIO Collection database, we checked that none of those genes were essential 
 <A href="#R4">[4]</A>.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>ppc</STRONG></LI></UL><P>The <EM>ppc</EM> gene encodes the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase enzyme (Ppc). This enzyme  catalyzes the following reaction  <A href="#R2">[2]</A>:</P><P align="center">

Deletion of the <EM>ppc</EM> gene will therefore prevent the PEP to be transformed into  oxaloacetate which is not interesting for our application. As shown on figures  1 and 2, the left part of the MAF pathway does not lead to hydrogen production.  Thus, deletion of <EM>ppc</EM> will inactivate  this part of the pathway and all the PEP will be transformed into pyruvate.</P><UL><LI><STRONG>ldhA</STRONG></LI></UL><P align="center">Pyruvate is transformed into  (R)-lactate or into formate + acetyl-CoA.

As  this method is described in great details in the ‘homologous recombination  module’, we will briefly summarize it here. This method consists in the  production of a gene-specific PCR fragment which contains an antibiotic  resistance gene and site-specific recombination sites (FRT) flanking this gene.  This PCR fragment is then electroporated in a strain containing the plasmid  helper λ (PH λ) (see homologous recombination module). This plasmid encodes the  genes of the Red system. The target gene is replaced by the resistance gene  through homologous recombination using the Red system. We worked with two  different antibiotic resistances: chloramphenicol (cm) and kanamicine (kan).
The antibiotic resistance  cassette is eventually removed by site-specific recombination using the Flp  recombinase. This method leads to the ‘clean’ deletion of the gene of interest  without any traces of antibiotic resistance gene. It is also adapted to delete  genes in operons since the resistance-FRT cassettes used in this work also contain  translation signal (RBS). This allows a proper expression of the genes  downstream of the deletion (no polar effect). The  primers used deleting the 5 genes of interest are listed in Table 1.  </P><LI><U>Phage P1  transduction</U></LI><P>P1vir stock :
  Overnight cultures of the donor strain are  diluted 100 fold in 20 ml of LB medium supplemented with MgSO4 10-2M  and of CaCl2 5.10-3M and grown at 37°C. At an optical density at  600nm of 0.2, 10µl of a P1 vir stock is added (approximately 109  pfu/ml). Once the bacteria are lysed, 1/20 (v/v) of chloroform is added and the  culture is vigorously shacked. The mix is centrifuged at 4°C at 3,700 g and the  supernatant is conserved at 4°C. 1/20 of the total volume of chloroform is  added and vigorously shacked, then centrifuged again in the same conditions.  The surnageant containing the P1 particles is stored at 4°C. 
  P1vir  transduction :
  Overnight culture of the recipient strain is  pelleted and resuspended in the same volume of MgSO4 10-2M and of  CaCl2 5.10-3M. To 100µl of the resuspended pellet, 100µl and 10µl of  the P1 lysat is added. The mix is conserved 30 min at 37°C. 3 ml of agar 0.7%  is added as well as 100µl of Na citrate 1M. The entire mix is plated on  selective plates at 37°C for 16h. The candidates are streaked 3 times on  selective plates and a PCR is then performed to confirm the transduction of the  marker of interest.  </P></OL><P> </P><P><GH2>Results</GH2></P><P> </P><LI><U>Deletion  of the <EM>ldhA</EM> gene by homologous recombination</U></LI><P>
  The amplification of the resistance cassettes with  the primers specific to our 5 genes of interest by PCR took us a little more  than a week. Because of the size of the primers used, we had to try several  times the PCR and vary the parameters. 
Here is the picture of the electrophoresis of  those PCR for the 5 genes: </P><P>
  For each genes we tried to obtain both  chloramphenicol (about 1100bp) and kanamicine (about 1500bp) resistance  cassettes. From left to right we have the genes <EM>ldhA</EM> (1 and 2), <EM>focA</EM> (4  and 5), <EM>ppc</EM> (7 and 8), <EM>hybC</EM> (10 and 11) and <EM>hyaB</EM> (13 and 14). The sinks 3, 6, 9, 12  and 15 are the five negative controls.
        Once  we obtained these cassettes, it took us about 1 month to obtain our first  deletion candidate. The electroporation efficiency of the MG1655/PHl strain was not good. We obtained a lot of false-positive deletion  candidates (i.e. clones growing on the selective medium). As explained in the homologous  recombination module, we had to purify at least three times each candidate  (this process takes therefore at least 3 days) before checking the  deletion/insertion of the resistance cassette. Using primers complementary to  the flanking regions of the genes of interest, PCR were performed on candidate  colonies (data shown below). Unfortunately, the candidates were most of the time  wild-type for the gene of interest. Our hypothesis is that the resistance  cassette was inserted at another location in the genome. The reason for that is  unknown since the genes of interest are not essential for <EM>E. coli</EM> viability, at least in the conditions we used.  
After  several weeks of unsuccessful attempts, we finally obtained the MG1655 <EM>D</EM><EM>ldhA::cm</EM> strain. 
Here is the picture of the  electrophoresis where we tested different deletion candidates:</P><P>The sinks we are interested in are the 4 first  ones. The wild type version of the gene <EM>ldhA</EM> is in the third sink. The two first sinks are the deletion candidates for <EM>ldhA </EM>with the cm resistance cassette<EM>.</EM> The fourth sink is the negative  control for this gene. For information, the other sinks are the tests for the 4  other genes: 5 and 6 are the deletion candidates for ppc; 9 and 10 are the  deletion candidates for focA; 17 and 18 are the deletion candidates for hybC:  21 and 22 are the deletion candidates for hyaB. Unfortunately, the cm  resistance cassette (about 1100 bp) and the gene <EM>ldhA</EM> (990 bp) have approximately the same length. In order to  testify if we really had the MG1655 <EM>D</EM><EM>ldhA::cm</EM> strain,  we did a test with a restriction enzyme which cut the gene <EM>ldhA.</EM>
The  result of this test is shown here:</P><P>After the purification process, we had 4 candidates  for the MG1655 <EM>DldhA::cm</EM> strain. For those 4 candidates, we did a PCR on  the gene <EM>ldhA </EM>(not knowing if it  really was <EM>ldhA</EM> or the cm resistance  cassette that we amplified) and we digest the product of the PCR with an enzyme  which cut <EM>ldhA.</EM> The digested gene <EM>ldhA</EM> is in the sink 7, the digested cm  resistance cassette is in the sink 6. The four digested candidates are in the 4  first sinks. The result is therefore a success, because the candidates are not  digested like <EM>ldhA</EM>. The wild-type  version of the gene has been successfully replaced with the cm resistance  cassette.

Three steps in the mixed acid fermentation pathway are of  interest:

As stated above, the FHL complex is  regulated by FNR, a transcriptional regulator that mediates the transition  between aerobic and anaerobic growth, and repressed by HyaC. It has been showed  that FHL activity is not the limiting step for hydrogen production. We decided  not to over-express the two enzymes of the FHL complex <A href="#R3">[3]</A>.
  On the basis of these three  reactions, we decided to overexpress the following genes:</P><UL><LI><STRONG><EM>fnr</EM></STRONG></LI></UL><P>        <EM>fnr</EM> is quite an obvious choice for the first gene to overexpress.  FNR is the main transcriptional regulator that mediates the transition from  aerobic to anaerobic growth <A href="#R2">[2]</A>. The concentration of the FNR protein is similar  under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The regulation occurs at the level of FNR  activity: in the presence of O2, FNR is inactivated. Under anaerobic  conditions, FNR is functional and activates expression of hundreds of genes  involved in anaerobic metabolism. In these conditions, FNR represses genes  involved in aerobic metabolism <A href="#R2">[2]</A>. Over-expressing the <EM>fnr</EM> gene should increase FNR concentration and should thus enhance  the anaerobic metabolism.

The reasons to overexpress  this gene are the same as for <EM>pflB</EM>.</P><P><GH2>Materials  and methods</GH2></P><P>
  To over-express these three  genes of interest, we decided to insert them into plasmid pSB1C3 with a strong  RBS, a constitutive promoter and a terminator. We decided to work in the  BioBrick standard assembly 10 because it is compatible with pSB1C3.  
  First of all, we had to  obtain the three genes to ligate them with the RBS, the promoter and the  terminator. Unfortunately, the <EM>fnr</EM> gene contains an EcoR1 restriction site. Therefore, we had to introduce a  silent mutation in the sequence of this restriction site and ordered the  modified <EM>fnr</EM> on mrgene.com. 
  The <EM>tdcE</EM> gene was obtained by PCR using specific primers and the wild-type  genome of <EM>E. coli</EM>. 
  The <EM>pflB</EM> sequence contains a restriction enzyme present in the standard  assembly 10: Pst1. We could have also introduced a silent mutation in this sequence  and ordered it on mrgene.com. However, due to the size of the <EM>pflb</EM> gene (2283 bp) and our limited  budget, we were not able to afford it.
  The RBS, the promoter and  the terminator that were selected are the same for the three genes and are  described as being the ‘strongest’ ones received in spring 2010 distribution.
  The promoter is: BBa_J23100 
  The RBS is: BBa_B0034
  The terminator is: BBa_B0024
  After obtaining the gene  sequences either by PCR or by <EM>in vitro</EM> synthesis, the plan was to ligated them into the plasmid containing the RBS  opened with Spe1 and Pst1 in order to clone the genes downstream of the RBS.  The genes were also digested by Xba1 and Pst1. The second step was to ligate  the part RBS + gene with the promoter. The third step consisted in extracting  the construction promoter + RBS + gene and inserting upstream of the  terminator. The last step was to extract the promoter+RBS+gene+terminator and  insert it into the pSB1C3 plasmid. 
  Unfortunately, due to lack  of time, we were unable to do all these constructs.
  We managed to obtain the  gene <EM>tdcE</EM> by PCR as we can see here:</P><P>The gene <EM>tdcE</EM> is in the sink 3  and 5. The two sinks correspond to two different PCR programs. The sinks 2 and  4 are the negative controls for those PCR.

The formate dehydrogenase-O is active under aerobic  conditions. We can therefore avoid deleting <EM>fdoG</EM> simply because our bacteria will be used under anaerobic conditions. The  formate dehydrogenase-N needs a source of nitrate to be active. In the  laboratory, it is easy to work on a medium which does not contain nitrogen and  we can avoid deleting this gene. In reality, in a sewage treatment facility,  this could be much more problematic. We can propose that our bacteria will be  used to produce hydrogen after the nitrogen removal step. Deleting <EM>fdnG</EM> would be necessary if we want to  produce hydrogen in a medium that contains nitrogen. Moreover, the formate  dehydrogenase-N is a much more effective enzyme than the FHL system. Most of  the formate will thus be consumed by the formate dehydrogenase-N instead of  being transformed into hydrogen.</P><P><GH2>Table  1</GH2></P><P>

  For FocA, we didn't  try to delete the entire gene because FocA is located next to pflB (one of the  genes useful for hydrogen production, see above). The RBS and the promoter of  pflB are included into the sequence of FocA. We decided to remove only the half  of FocA, leaving the RBS and promoter of pflB untouched.
