The Extra-Scientific issues of Hydrocoli
Issues  of intellectual property rights
 
The following chapter examines  the question of intellectual and industrial property. This is one of the core  issues of the IGEM competition.  This  pragmatic aspect of science and technology is relevant for every person taking  part in the contest. As we’ve already mentioned, synthetic biology is a young  field which is expanding at an incredible rate, making property rights a major  issue.
Firstly, what exactly does the  term “intellectual property” refer to? Intellectual property is anything that  the human mind creates which takes a material form. It includes artistic  creations in general and author’s rights, on the one hand, and on the other  hand, industrial property.  Patents,  brands, logos, models, and controlled designation all are intellectual  property. Anything that can be patented will be referred to as an “invention” in the epistemological analysis that follows. An invention, as opposed to a  discovery, can be patented. Discoveries concern pre-existing phenomena whereas  inventions are the product of an innovative intellectual process. Among others  things, products, processes (for example biological processes) and information  technologies can be patented, whereas recipes and mathematical proofs  cannot. 
IGEM is mainly concerned with  directly applied research, but theoretical research can also lead to results  with potential commercial value.  In any  case, IGEM brings up certain questions surrounding patents. Patents are a very  interesting epistemological subject, both from a practical and a philosophical  point of view. They are what links theoretical science to applied science.  valorization, both industrial and commercial, is in fact one of the primary  goals of universities, along with research and education. The valorization of  research often contributes to the societal good. This valorization is not a  secondary goal, it is present as a driving force from the start, and is evident  in the call to tender and the search for sponsors. This issue is present from  the first results, making protection of these results imperative until they can  be exploited.
Depending on the expected  economic end result of a project, the funds which finance it will come from  different bodies. Obviously, private firms will be more likely to finance  research which leads to commercial applications. Intrinsic research conditions  are thus not always sufficient for it to be carried out. Very often, the  successful accomplishment of the research depends on exterior conditions.
Three criteria must be  fulfilled if a result is to be patented: firstly, the invention must be  innovative. Secondly, the invention must have a technical effect which is non  evident or resolve an old problem which remained unsolved. This is known as “inventive activity”.        Lastly, the  point of an invention patent is to make the invention exploitable industrially.  For example, a new surgical technique does not fulfill this last criterion  because its application is not industrial.
The results of research  conducted at a university are the property of that university. However, the  researchers are named as inventors and have the right to a third of the  financial returns. To be considered an inventor, one must furnish proof that  one’s contribution played a crucial role in the development of the patented  product. Students and technicians alike can be inventors.  The university may have the property rights  on all results, but this goes hand in hand with being responsible for all fees  accruing from the patenting process.  
Declaring an invention is a  lengthy and costly process. A patent has extremely important advantages though.  Firstly, it protects the inventors’ rights from unscrupulous competition. This  is one of patent law’s raison d’être, because it encourages economic growth by  providing an incentive to innovate. An exploitation monopoly is rarely the goal  of the patenting process though, mostly, firms want to be compensated in the  form of monetary permits. [11] Patents also encourage partnerships between the public  and the private sectors. The first, universities generally, get financing from  these partnerships, the second, businesses, get access to innovations.  Patenting records also serve as a performance indicator and are used as  criteria for allocating research contracts. Patenting also ensures financial  returns from an innovation and makes the creation of spin-offs possible.
Obtaining a patent involves a  complicated process which must be followed closely. If the innovation has been  divulged, be it orally or in writing, to anyone before patenting, obtaining a  patent is extremely difficult. Divulgation refers to any description detailed  enough to make it possible for a member of the profession to recreate the invention.  Depending on the field, divulgation can consist of a single sentence or several  pages of complex instructions.
IGEM promotes open source  knowledge, relying on intellectual honesty. However, certain unscrupulous  businesses actually hire spies whose job is tracking down any unwary  information leak which can make patenting difficult for the innovator. This  involves tracking  the internet, posters,  articles, thesis, papers but also calls to tender and contests. This means that  any team who presents their project at IGEM risks compromising the exclusivity  of their research if they haven’t done the necessary paperwork beforehand.
Orally, divulgation can happen  during a speech, a congress or even a professional conference if a  confidentiality clause has not been signed. A tour of a laboratory or mailing  of equipment can also be ways of revealing too much. Divulgation removes  information from ownership and puts it in the public domain. Anyone is then  free to use it and share it. Secrecy until the patent is applied for is thus  the best way to avoid this problem. Ideally, any information published prior to  the research should contain no more information than what is in the patent  application. Once a patent is applied for, there is an 18 month delay before the  invention can be safely fully divulged.
 
The laboratory journal
                This is a reference book which  allows researchers to date and record their research. It must mention the name  of the users and of its owners and can serve as proof when invention paternity  is contested.  It is an extremely  valuable tool for the valorization of research on every level. This journal  also plays an important internal role, making coordination  and development easier.
 
Declaring  an invention involves several steps. A form describing the invention must be  filled out in order to determine if the innovation is covered by a previous  patent. This is made possible by the existence of databases. Once this is  ensured, the inventors are named. this process relies on the laboratory manual.  An invention patent is characterised by the following caracteristics :
- It is an intellectual property title, giving the  inventors the right to authorize or not the exploitation of the invention by  another party. The right conferred is not a right to exploit, but a right to  stop others from exploiting.
- It is limited geographically. The inventor  determines which national markets must be covered by the patent. For thirty  months prior to the choice of countries, the patent covers the entire world.
- It is limited in time. 20 years is the standard  period for all inventions except drugs which have five extra years to make up  for the time lost on trials.
- It is non-renewable; once its time has run out, the  invention automatically becomes a part of the public domain.
Patents  are usually applied for with the aim of getting monetary returns from  inventions. There are different ways in which patenting helps to achieve this  goal. Through licensing agreements, the invention can be exploited by a second  party who “rents” the property rights. Patents can also be sold, or spin-offs  created. Spin-offs are new firms which can exploit the patent but which depend  on the mother firm. New research contracts are also more likely if successful  patents have been applied for in the past. Monetary compensation can take three  forms: upfront payments, royalties (a percentage of the profits), or  milestones, which are fixed amounts to be paid when certain benchmarks are hit.  The inventor can thus ensure that his or her licence will benefit him or her even  in the case where the other party doesn’t manage industrial exploitation of the  product. 
To sum up, patenting is a  difficult process and as such, may seem like a burden to engineers.  Furthermore, the fact that the driving force of research is pecuniary means  that research without industrial applications can sometimes be left by the  wayside. However, without the legal protection of intellectual property rights,  there would be no incentive to innovate and hence no demand for engineers. 
 
A  few words of caution for engineers: the difficulties of marketing the products  of biotechnology
 
 
 “There is nothing more difficult to plan, more  doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage than the creation of a new  order of things… whenever his enemies have the ability to attack the innovator  they do so with the passion of partisans…”
Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince [12]
 
The purpose of  this chapter is not to provide a complete marketing plan for hydrocoli. This type of market study  requires quantitative data that our team cannot fund. The purpose here is to  show the difficulties of marketing even a seemingly sure thing and to give  entrepreneurs food for thought. On today’s “small is beautiful” business  horizon, many R & D professionals attempt to save money by bringing their  products directly to the market, without consulting management and marketing  professionals. This is not inherently dangerous, but it is always useful to  stop and think before attempting to patent and sell a good. In this paper, we  review a series of articles and case studies which we hope will provide an  overview of the main issues of marketing biotechnologies. we have focused on  those which relate to our team’s project, in the hope that bio-engineers will  come away with a sense of the complexity of consumer attitudes and the  difficulties of getting consumers to accept an innovation.     
 
Some  useful lessons from consumer attitudes towards genetically modified foods
 
The following  analysis of likely consumer attitudes towards the end result of the ULB project  is largely based on consumer attitudes towards genetically modified foods. The  reason for this is that a lot more research has been done in the area of food  production than in other areas where synthetic biology is applied.
The focus on  foods in the literature can be explained by the fact that what consumers eat  affects them directly, and they are therefore likely to have stronger, and  easier to measure, opinions on this subject than on more obscure applications  of biotechnology. Extending the research on GM foods to hydrocoli seems reasonable however when you consider that a fair  share of consumer dissatisfaction with GM foods stems not from the experience  with the product as such, which is in fact likely to be on average more  satisfactory than experience with non-GM foods, but from concerns about genetic  modification and biotechnologies generally.
These concerns  range from a vague uneasiness with the idea of genetic manipulation to  full-blown terror of the consequences for the environment and for our health.  Consumer attitudes towards gene technologies, even if originally studied in the  context of foodstuffs, can clearly be extended to include consumer attitudes  towards hydrocoli. Furthermore, as a technology that could eventually be  directly applied by individual heads of households, it could be argued that hydrocoli fits into the category of consumer goods and services.
Concerns about hydrocoli are likely to stress risks to  bio-diversity and the environment rather than health risks, but the risk aversion  analysis remains relevant. Having said this, perceptions of what is unhealthy  to ingest are not straightforward but depend on complex cultural conditions,  which means there may be consumer concern over drinking water which was  purified using genetic technology. These specific concerns are therefore  directly relevant to the research on GM foods. 
While many  activist environmental groups are lobbying against genetically modified foods,  most members of the general public do not seem to have strong opinions on the  subject (Scholderer and Frewer, 2003). This is true especially in the US, where  GMO’s are mostly regarded neutrally or favorably. In Europe, public opinion  tends to be more firmly against GMOs, which explains the partial moratorium on  their cultivation and sale
 
The  European view
 
Although the use  of transgenic crops was approved in the EU in 1995, following the “mad cow” outbreak in the late nineties, food origin became a major public concern. This  resulted in a halt on approving new GMOs for import and cultivation in 1998.  The ban was partially lifted in 2004 after protest from the US, who claimed the  ban was a protectionist measure, violating trade agreements between the two  powers. Despite these protests, the EU is still moving slowly and reluctantly  to approve the cultivation of transgenic crops. European pressure groups, made  up mainly of bio-tech firms and farmers, are now lobbying for an easing of  anti-GMO measures.
Things are  moving slowly, but they are moving. For now, even if only one kind of  transgenic seed is currently legal for cultivation in the EU, the farmer’s  unions have been adding steadily to the list of permitted transgenic imports,  despite powerful lobbying from NGOs such as Greenpeace.  European farmers argue that the partial ban  on GM crops makes it impossible for them to attain sufficient yields to keep  their prices competitive.
 
The  US view
 
US consumers  look upon GMOs much more favorably than their European counterparts, making the  US the leading pioneer in terms of novel food technologies. Before the public  outcry at the beginning of the millennium, biotechnology was seen by many as a  panacea which would end food and energy shortages as well as pollution of all  stripes. Executive Order 13134, signed by President Bill Clinton in 1999,  stipulated the goal of tripling the US’s use of bio-based products by 2010  through an increased use of biotechnologies. Indeed, since 1990, bioengineered  products have been a part of the consumer landscape.
The FDA is  currently looking into the approval of the first genetically modified animal to  be marketed: the salmon pioneered by AquaBounty, referred to by critics as “frankenfish”, is destined to appear on supermarket shelves in as little as two  years. All is not smooth sailing however on the biotech horizon, as there  remains significant difficulty regarding the commercialization of “frankenfoods”, due to lobbying from environmental groups and to consumer  unease.
Such  environmental activism is not difficult to understand, as the true risks of  biotechnologies for biodiversity are not currently known. Consumer unease  leaves some baffled, but it is generally considered that it stems from a lack  of information, which leads biotech firms to emphasize the information-deficit  aspect in their advertising.  Since less  than 2% of the US population is currently involved in the agricultural  production process, it stands to reason that a large portion of the general  public feels left out of the food production realm and perceives itself as  insufficiently informed. Indeed, many aspects of biotechnology remain  mysterious to the general public. Many laymen even believe that, following  widely mediatised issues such as the monarch butterfly controversy [13] biologically engineered foods are not  sold commercially to the general public. This is clearly not the case, as it is  estimated that up to 70% of processed foods sold to American consumers contain  at least one ingredient produced through biotechnology. In fact, corn and  soybean crops rely heavily on bioengineered strains which are more pest  resistant. In addition, cheese production relies on an engineered enzyme and  bioengineered yeast is widely used in breads. The fact is that misinformation  or information gaps tend to drive perceptions and slow the potential payoffs  from R&D in bioengineering.
 
Recognizing  information asymmetry in bioengineering as a driver of attitudes
 
The science  behind bioengineering is complex, but questions of regulation, labeling and the  risks inherent to synthetic biology are no less hazy for the average consumer  than the organic chemistry behind the product. There is clearly an  informational asymmetry [14] here which may indeed explain in part  the public’s resistance to the notion of bioengineering. One could, and many  do, argue that there has been insufficient effort made to educate consumers  about bioengineering, when a sincere discussion of the risks and benefits of  such technologies would perhaps have led to a more favorable image.
Some studies  support the idea that fear of biotechnology is a direct consequence of an  information asymmetry (see Traill et al.,  2004; Baker et al., 2001). Traill  used experimental auctions in the US, England and France, to show the effect of  information shocks on willingness-to-accept [15] money in exchange for consuming GM  foods. Subjects were recruited and given two cookies, one clearly labeled as  containing GM foods. Researchers then measured, through bidding, how much money  the subjects demanded in exchange for having to eat the GM cookie. The subjects  were then randomly assigned to one of four treatments: information focusing on  the environmental benefits of biotechnologies, information concerning health  benefits, information concerning a world benefit in the form of drought  resistant crops or no information at all. Following these treatments, their  willingness-to-accept was measured again. Traill found that information about  world, health and environmental benefits significantly decreased the monetary  compensation that subjects demanded to eat the GM cookie. The primary  conclusion of this study was that information concerning the benefits of GM  foods makes consumers more willing to consume them. This is perhaps not  surprising; it gels with the common sense view that if consumers do not want to  eat GM foods it is because they just don’t know how good they really are.  However, this study also found that the influence of attitudes adopted by the  subjects before the study began had a significant influence on their reaction  when faced with information treatments.
Another study  supporting this standard view is Boy, 2001. Boy surveyed the attitudes of  European consumers by using the Eurobarometer results to establish the relative importance in attitude formation of the perceptions  of utility [16] and risk. He found that, no matter how  great or small the risk perceived, consumers will not even consider a product  if a minimum of utility has not been shown. The econometrics used by Boy  clearly showed that the perception of utility is more important than the  perception of risk in forming attitudes towards products which result from  biotechnologies.
This view  explains the lack of consumer enthusiasm for first-generation biotech goods  entirely with the lack of directly perceivable benefits for consumers, making a  case for the usefulness of the traditional biotech marketing strategy which  aims at informing consumers of all the benefits in store for them (Marris,  2001). This position can be linked to the “deficit model” of public  understanding of science, which basically assumes that any failure of consumer  attitudes to align with those of R & D professionals can be blamed on an insufficient  effort to “educate” an ignorant public. 
 
Dealing  with information asymmetries
 
There are many  tools available to those who wish to close an information gap. Assuming that  information is the way to consumers’ ‘hearts’, choosing the public-consultation  mechanism is no simple task for the policy maker. Special committees are often  established to make these decisions. These are usually made up of technicians,  scientists, ethical experts and laymen. Their main roles are testing public  opinion, informing the public if requested to do so and consulting the public  when necessary.  There are different  mechanisms one can use to accomplish these tasks. For an analysis of these  mechanisms and their respective advantages, see Leroux et al, 1998. 
Putting aside  the question of how to consult and inform the public effectively, research from  sociology and consumer science shows that the solution to consumer mistrust may  not be as simple as designing communication mechanisms that will reach a  maximum of consumers. The literature shows that attitude formation is a highly  complex process. Scholderer and Frewer (2003) reached the highly  counter-intuitive conclusion that consumers will actually be less likely to  choose GM foods after an information shock, regardless  of whether the information highlights the risks of GM foods, their benefits or  both in equal measure. This communication paradox highlights the important  difference between product choice and attitudes.
Scholderer and  Frewer found that information brought about no significant change in attitude,  be it positive or negative, whereas it did affect willingness to choose GM  products. This willingness turned out to be negatively correlated to  information received, regardless of what kind. This can be explained by an “attitude  activation process”. This means that information, negative or positive,  activates attitudes that were already held prior to the confrontation.  Moreover, those who hold positive attitudes are found to be more likely to  accept new information than those who hold strong negative attitudes. Putting  aside the econometrics involved, this can be explained by a cursory examination  of human nature. It seems obvious that adoption of a negative attitude can be  both a consequence and a cause of mistrust of the authorities involved. The  findings of this team seem to indicate that current biotech advertising  strategies may in fact increase consumer aversion to buying bioengineered  products, without having a significant influence on their attitudes.  
 
Consumer  rights: a look at agency
 
We do not mean  to suggest that consumers should not demand and receive relative transparency  concerning biotechnologies, but merely that constantly bombarding the public  with reminders of the benefits of biotechnologies is perhaps not an efficient  marketing strategy.  Anyone who can  potentially be affected by a new technology should be allowed to express  concern, request information and be involved in the decision-making process. To  deny this basic right is to deny the merits of democracy. The problem arises  because this decision-making process is not clearly defined in time or in  space. Our society is ruled by supply and demand. Whether one accepts this as  beneficial to us all or sees it as a nail in our collective coffin, it is  undeniable that we are seeing the end of big government, and markets are taking  its place. Ultimately, the market will determine what can or cannot be produced  and consumed.  We do not mean to adopt a  holistic approach; the market is made up of individual consumers. However, in  terms of consumer concerns, the rule of supply and demand has the same basic  flaw as democracy: namely, majority rule is not synonymous with representation.  This fundamental issue makes it almost impossible for concerned consumers to  take any real action in the face of global acceptance.
This is a  serious quandary in the case of biotechnology because it may have the potential  to change the world by providing resources that are so renewable as to be  virtually inexhaustible. At this stage, many reason that we cannot afford to  ignore this kind of opportunity. Others however fear biotechnology. Whether  this fear is justified remains to be seen, but either way, in practice, it is  no match for the imperative of change.
It is interesting  to note that some more or less harmful technologies slip by potentially  influential consumers without causing a stir, whereas others, such as  biotechnology and nuclear energy, fall prey to negative buzz. While we in no  way wish to denigrate the concerned consumer or her right to play a part in the  debate, it is interesting to note that the appearance of, for example, the SUV  raised no ruckus at first, despite risks of possibly the same magnitude, at  least when applying the precautionary principle [17] , as those of biotechnologies.
Standard dogma  explains this with the hypothesis that agents are more likely to accept risk  when it is perceived as being voluntarily taken. Empirically, the illusion of  agency or lack thereof when it comes to risk taking has a huge impact on risk  aversion. Wildavsky (1998) points to the example of a socially minded public  health worker who will gladly work intimately with patients infected with HIV  and AIDS, but expresses absolute refusal when it comes to GMOs in her food intake.  The standard interpretation of this phenomenon is as follows:  the public health worker accepts any risk  inherent to her chosen activity because she feels responsible for those risks;  she alone has weighed the pros and cons and made her decision. However, the  attempted introduction of GMOs on the market without an ex-ante public discussion leads to the loss of this feeling of  agency, leaving the consumer feeling as though a force stronger than her has  been trying to “put one over” on her and consequently to an overestimation of  the risk involved.
Wildavsky  modifies this standard interpretation of risk aversion, pointing out that the  line between a voluntary and an involuntary risk is very fine. He states that  the way one perceives risk depends in fact on ones ‘culture’ [18] and that according to the adopted culture,  the agent will define her risks a  posteriori as voluntary or involuntary. This is interesting because in the  standard interpretation of risk aversion, the consumer can be the object of an  involuntary risk and the subject of a voluntarily taken risk. Once she notices  the risks she did not sign up for, she will resist being subjected to them.
In Wildavsky’s  interpretation, the crucial difference is that the consumer exercises a  subconscious agency in her determination of which risks are voluntary or not.  For example, the public health worker in question is likely to be politically  left-leaning; in Wildavsky’s terms, she believes in a non-hierarchical culture.  She perceives big business as being more powerful than she is and this in turn  bothers her. The products of this business will be subjected to closer scrutiny  than for example someone she perceives as needing her help. In this scenario,  her non-hierarchical belief system will lead her to take greater risks and she  may gladly stand between them and a bullet.
Our purpose here  is to show that the issue of consumer mistrust is far from being a simple one  and is not easily solved; the image of a product, of the business which  produced it, the area in which it is produced and the market it is aimed at are  all factors that can have a significant influence on the levels of transparency  and accountability that the public will expect, demand, and for which they will  lobby. 
 
Labelling  goods to reduce aversion
 
A lot of  legislation exists to protect the consumer’s right to relative transparency,  but consumers are seldom fully informed. Despite this, a vague awareness of the  existence of labeling restrictions may give them the illusion of agency. We can  read the word “organic” on a label, and then decide to put that object into our  cart or to opt for a cheaper brand. We then accept the health risks of  non-organic food because we it was our decision to buy that product.
However labels  refer to ingredients and nutritional content, and in certain cases origin, but  not to method of production. This is a central issue in the case of biotech  products, because studies have fa€iled to find any unwanted difference in the  actual composition of the foodstuff, hence in the health risks, making labeling  a moot point under current directives. In the EU however, any food containing  more than 0.9% of GM ingredients must be labeled as such.
 
Technophobia
 
In addition to  perceived health risks, there is the issue of general technophobia. Bernett et al (2009) point to two prevailing  myths surrounding technology. One of the two prevailing myths about technology  is that is it can lead only to evil. The argument goes something like this: Man  was born in a state of purity, close to nature, and was then brought  increasingly further and further away from this innocent state by technology and  science, leading to the imminent extinction of a fallen species. While this  position does not rely on hard facts, it should not be dismissed or  disrespected. Researchers and those responsible for the commercialization of  the products of technological research should accept part of the responsibility  for consumer mistrust. In fact, historically, the consumer has had no agency in  the appearance of innovations on the market; her agency relies solely on her  actions as a buyer.
Moreover,  Bernett makes the important point that the other prevailing myth is just as  false, just as dangerous and also to be avoided: that which states that  technology is the panacea, the perfect way to work out the kinks of modernism.  This position is exemplified by the current enthusiasm for “bridging the  digital divide” [19] .
Bernett argues that the hard  data does not point to the introduction of technological innovations as  necessarily bringing social benefits. In fact, case studies showing the  opposite are not hard to find (see Dutton et  al., 2005 or Saint-Paul, 2008).  In  his seminal book, Diffusion of  Innovations, Rogers (1995) uses several important case studies [20] to show that innovation can have devastating effects  and makes a case for the need for a complete study of the circumstances of said  innovation before implementation.
 
Innovation,  the “industrial religion“
 
We make this point not only in  the interests of avoiding unexpected social costs, but also from a purely  commercial point of view. Consumers resist innovation; in laymen’s terms,  people do not like change. This is the point made by the introductory citation  and the quantitative data support Machiavelli in this. This phenomenon is known  as inertia. Decisions and attitudes, once made, are hard to turn back, although  certain influential agents can aid this process, which explains the focus on “buzz” [21] advertising and attempts at garnering the favor of “e-fluentials” [22] . Brand image is inert, and genetically modified  products currently have a negative brand image, especially in the face of the  growth of the market for “organic” or “natural” foods.
For any business, innovation  can mean survival. Innovation has even been  called the industrial religion [23] . In view of this, it seems that biotech entrepreneurs  and businesses should have no trouble sailing prosperously through the 21st  century in a context where the old ways have proven unsustainable and the stage  is set for new ways.
The validity of the innovation  itself however, does not guarantee prosperity or even survival. Public resistance  is hard to predict, and start-ups do not tend have the marketing expertise or  resources needed to gather all the necessary data or to put this data to good  use. Examples of seemingly sound investments which did not deliver as expected  include the Concorde and the Dvorak typing keyboard [24] . Why wouldn’t consumers want to travel twice as fast?  Why not switch to a more efficient keyboard?
 
Why  innovations fail
 
Rogers’ book opens with a case  study which is particularly relevant to us, that concerning the attempted  introduction of boiling water prior to drinking it in a village in Peru. The  Peruvian government planned to significantly reduce the incidence of  water-contamination related diseases in the country by sending social workers  to isolated villages to teach the locals to boil their water before  consumption. The plan seemed straightforward enough; the technology was simple,  accessible, free and had clear benefits to the policy makers. However, the  attempt at introducing water boiling failed. Two main issues, ignored by the  planners, contributed to this failure.
Firstly, local customs and  beliefs included a complex understanding of food temperature. Some foods were  perceived as inherently hot, others as inherently cold. The idea of germs as  explained by the social worker was not as convincing as these age-old customs.  This mistrust of new information was aggravated by the second cause of failure:  the insider-outsider phenomenon [25] . The social worker, as a native of a big town, was  perceived as intrusive and her attempts at advising the locals as sheer  arrogance. Indeed, this is perhaps understandable after a long history of a “daddy knows best” approach to humanitarian aid. The level of trust that people  place in the innovator is perhaps the most important factor influencing  adoption or refusal.
This case is directly relevant  to hydrocoli for two reasons:  firstly, because in this case, cleaner water was made available through the use  of a straightforward technology, but this presumably fail-proof innovation  still failed. Secondly, the importance of trust in the innovator has direct  consequences in the case of big biotech businesses, whose profit-seeking nature  causes many to suspect their motives at all times, even when they are involved  in humanitarian work.  It has been shown  that French consumers actually mistrust companies who engage their social  responsibility by doing charity work more than those whose stated goal never  varies from pure profit-seeking (Hamilton et  al., 1990).
The importance of marketing an  innovation properly can therefore not be underestimated, no matter how positive  the consequences for the consumer may be. It is not enough to provide a more  efficient, healthier, more sustainable or better quality good or service;  consumers are not always fully aware of these qualities. Even if told, they may  mistrust the teller.
The question of adoption or refusal  of an innovation cannot be answered simply and it is not our purpose to explain  the complex reasons for the refusal of adoption of seemingly sure things. We  merely cite these examples as a warning to engineers: it takes more than  venture capital and a great idea to be a successful entrepreneur. Common sense  is not sufficient to explain or predict consumer actions and attitudes. We  cannot stress the importance of a market study enough.  A firm’s viability in the market can depend  solely on its ability to market its products efficiently. To take an example  from another rapidly developing sector, IBM is a striking instance of the  importance of marketing for survival; IBM’s personal computer, in many ways  inferior, in terms of performance, to substitutes on the market, survived,  perhaps solely, thanks to brilliant commercialization and marketing strategy  (Dodgson, 2000).
 
Is saving the environment the way  to consumers’ hearts?
 
Marketing is not to be  confused with advertising. Marketing includes all processes that aim at meeting  consumer needs. Sometimes, a market study may find that there simply is no  market for a developed good or service, leading to a discontinuation of the research.  Standard marketing dogma points out the  following steps: identifying consumer needs, developing a product which can  fulfill those needs, then advertising the product (in this modelised world,  advertising is reduced to informing the public of the product’s existence);  naturally, once consumers are aware of the existence of a way to make them more  comfortable, they will buy the good or service until their needs are met, at  which point the market is saturated and businesses will need to identify a new  consumer need, etc. (Gauthy-Senechal and Vandercammen, 2010, or almost any  marketing manual).
However, although Western  consumers with spending power may currently be feeling the effects of food and  energy inflation to a certain extent, they are still basically in a comfortable  position. Biotechnology offers solutions to problems that we may be aware of,  but that are not (yet!) pressing in our day to day lives. We may be conscious  of global warming, but there is still a market for South African grapes and  sports vehicles. Therefore, while the potential demand for environmentally  friendly products should be huge, as we mentioned previously, these products  still need careful marketing.
There is a serious asymmetry  of information problem here, because to the consumer, while two pears might  taste alike and two plastic bags may carry the same load, the environmental  impact of one can be much lighter than that of the other. Businesses can thus  not rely on the standard marketing dogma, which aims to identify what customers  want and then to provide it. Indeed, it is safe to assume that people want to  survive on this planet without serious sacrifices in terms of living standards.  This may be achievable through biotechnology, but how to integrate this long  term effect into the consumer’s choice between two similar tasting pears? In  fact, while it may be obvious that people prefer a product which is  environmentally friendly, sustainable and healthy, these three product  characteristics cannot actually be experienced through consumption of the  product. Fazio et al (1989)  highlighted three conditions which need to be fulfilled in order for this type  of characteristic to influence consumer choice:
access  to external cues which link the product to the quality (product  labeling and advertising);
positive  perception of the quality and activation of this perception when considering  the product (this is extremely difficult in the case of biotechnologies because  some studies show that GMO’s may be perceived as “inherently harmful” by  consumers (Scholderer et al., 1999));
the  belief that there is in fact a link between the product and the quality in  question.
These conditions, in short, refer to internalization,  in the eyes of consumers, of the benefits of sustainability, environmentally  friendliness and health into the good itself as found on the supermarket shelf.  It is delicate, but if a good or service is to be marketed solely on the basis  of its sustainability or health benefits, these criteria must be met.
 
Conclusions
 
In conclusion, while gene  technologies may offer a way out of the mess the human race is undoubtedly in,  if they are to become commonplace, it is absolutely essential that engineers  work closely with all factions of society and   with professionals from various fields to undertake a complete analysis  of the ramifications of their innovation. The ramifications which must be taken  into account include those elucidated through economic, environmental or  sociological analysis. This must be done not only to avoid harmful applications  of the developed good, but also to avoid the real or perceived issues that are  a source of concern to consumers. All these elements must be taken into  consideration by the innovator, if only in the interests of seeing his or her  good succeed in a market which is increasingly complex. 
 
Economic  and investment opportunities of Hydrocoli
 
Despite the slow rate of  change in both technology and consumer habits, it is now widely accepted that  energy is one of the biggest issues faced by humanity today. Over the last  fifty years, the world’s population has more than doubled, and its energy  consumption has followed suit. Moreover, the economic growth of the BRICs [2] means  higher standards of living for billions more people. This increase in living  standards goes hand in hand with an increase in the demand, and hence the production,  of energy.
Since the industrial  revolution, the production and storage of energy, as well as their byproducts,  have been problematic, causing huge costs which prices rarely reflect. The  damages wrought upon natural resources and human lives have consistently been  left out of market mechanisms. This type of situation in which the price for  consumers and the cost for producers fail to reflect the actual social cost is  known as a negative externality. The textbook example is that of a steel  producer who dumps sludge up the river from fishermen, affecting the fish  population upon which the fishermen’s livelihood depends. Externalities arise  when markets fail to internalize the actual costs or benefits of a good, hence  their name.
The main sources of energy  throughout history have all presented negative externalities. Coal could be  extracted cheaply but the release of greenhouse gases and the damage to the  underpaid miners’ lungs constitute important negative externalities. Sperm  whale oil is another good example; again, whaling was an incredibly dangerous  profession and the near-extinction of whales is a potential threat to  biodiversity. The most striking example for our generation is, clearly, fossil  fuels and global warming. Oil is still relatively cheap despite its actual  costs being through the roof, in terms of the environmental debt we will leave  our children and, albeit debatably, the wars being fought to insure that oil is  available in plentiful quantities.
Governments are scrambling to  find a solution to the energy crisis, but traditional policy tools fail in the  face of the problem. The problem of climate change is global, leading to  negotiation costs that are through-the-roof and to property rights debates that  can never be satisfactorily resolved. Vaguely defined property rights make  adequate regulation impossible, be it through price or quantity fixing,. Some  theorists draw a parallel between the current environmental crisis and the  Great Depression and express concern that a “green dictatorship” will arise  (see Radcliff, 2002), much as communist dictatorships arose in the face of a  keenly felt economic crisis. Barring that drastic outcome and assuming that  consumers and businesses are not likely to spontaneously change their ways, no  matter how serious the risks we face, it seems the most viable solution to the  energy crisis is not less of the same but more of something different. As  possibly the only way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and land-use, the  development of alternative sources of energy is a crucial issue for humanity.  Government action may be able to influence our habits, but at too slow a rate,  as governments are concerned first and foremost with the instant gratification  of the electorate (Mankiw, 2008).
Besides the democratic state’s  inherent inability to take drastic action,  generally speaking governmental power is  dwindling throughout the developed world as the range of what is perceived to  be the public arena is reduced through the privatization of services. This  privatization trend has many worried, but several authors show that it can lead  to important gains in efficiency (see Estache et al., 2001). We will discuss the case of Argentina where the  privatization of water utilities has been shown to increase social gain by  decreasing child mortality.
Neo-classical economics holds that  negative externalities can be internalized in the market under certain  conditions, and it is only when these conditions are not met that the State  must step in and use tax and subsidy instruments to reach a social optimum.  This standard dogma holds that there is a socially optimal level of pollution,  different from zero, because the social cost in terms of jobs and other social  benefits which arise from industry is at some point higher than the social gain  from reducing pollution. However, in the presence of a competitive market for  alternative energy sources, might not these issues resolve themselves? Private  entrepreneurs are working on developing ways to produce clean energy in order  to be competitive in what is possibly a very profitable emerging market. The  competitive market may, in this case, manage to remove the reliance on altruism  and long-term planning which the human race finds so difficult to survive on. 
In 1970, while giving a talk  at the General Motors Technical Center, John Bockris coined the term “hydrogen  economy”. He was referring to a future of moving away from fossil fuel  dependency towards an economy in which the main energy source would be  hydrogen. Forty years later, we still rely heavily on fossil fuels. Hydrogen does  indeed present many advantages when compared with other energy sources but it  is an energy carrier, not a primary energy source, so the energy in question  must be generated through wind, solar, or fossil power and then stored in the  hydrogen molecules. These technologies are thus a better, but not an ideal,  alternative to petroleum-based energy. However, biotechnology may, in the not  too distant future, provide a way to produce clean hydrogen from elements that  are otherwise undervalued, in our case, wastewater. If we are to accept the  fact that our fossil fuel economy is no longer sustainable, the potential  demand for non fossil energy sources is enormous. The development and  implementation of Hydrocoli is thus potentially a very  profitable investment.
Besides the undeniably sound  future of the alternative energy source market, Hydrocoli presents other investment advantages. Access to clean  water is an essential standard for survival, making the demand for clean water  inelastic when incomes face a downward trend (Galiani et al., 2003). While some uses of water are among the first  luxuries to go in the case of shortage (recreational services such as golf  courses and swimming pools), there remains an incompressible level of water  demand for drinking and hygiene purposes. Moreover, the  possibility of future scarcity of this most basic resource is increasingly  obvious and the consequences of such scarcity would be drastic for every sector  of the economy. This impending scarcity leads some to refer to water as “blue  gold” (Barlow and Clarke, 2002) meaning of course that those who retain the property  rights to clean water would effectively be the oil magnates of the future.
Because of the link between  water and health, the market for clean water generates positive externalities  for all concerned. Many water washed diseases as well as diseases carried in  polluted water can be eradicated through access to clean water, reducing health  costs and making for a healthier and larger labor market. Moreover, inefficient  treatment of waste can lead to the pollution of other resources when it is  released into the environment. Stagnant pools of waste are also breeding  grounds for various disease carrying insects, and the treatment of the waste  can thus reduce the risk of such diseases, particularly malaria.
Traditionally, another  characteristic of the water utility market is the huge fixed costs involved.  The infrastructure needed for water treatment, evacuation and distribution is  considerable and costly, under current technological conditions. It is  estimated that, in 1994, fixed costs represented over 80% of water service  costs in the UK (Armstrong et al,  1994).
These characteristics of the  water market mean that traditionally, water utilities have been considered part  of the State’s responsibility, and have been financed and regulated by the  authorities. This system is generally perceived as being more efficient in  terms of social costs and gains. However, the increasing deregulation over the  last thirty years has led certain countries to privatize as many sectors as  possible. There remains a lot of mistrust in the face of this deregulation, as  privatization is, to many people, synonymous of higher prices, lower quality  services and more inequality. As a utility which demands the presence of large  infrastructures, and in the presence of such important positive health  externalities, water treatment may seem like the perfect example of a service  which should be regulated by the state. Studies show however (Estache et al, 2001) that privatization, under  certain circumstances, can lead to significant gains in revenue and well being.
Galiani et al studied the impact of privatization on water network  connection rates and child mortality rates in Argentina in the 1990’s. This  study showed a negative relationship between child mortality rates and the  privatization of water utilities. Galiani controlled for unbiasedness,  robustness and statistical significance of his conclusion, and found that this  negative relation holds, with decreases of child mortality rates varying between  4% and 10% for an increase in privatization, depending on the econometrics  involved.
These results may surprise  some, because as mentioned above, privatization is expected to lead to less  equity, not more. It is clear that these results cannot be generalized without  caution as the basis of a case for privatizing water treatment and provision.  However, they do highlight the important fact that the assumption of social  gain obtained from the intervention of the State in markets relies on the  assumption of a relatively functional, transparent, efficient and well-meaning  State. Barring this, privatization can logically be the most beneficial,  cost-effective and egalitarian solution.
Clearly, in the case of a monopoly  or oligarchy, the consequences of deregulation can be absolutely disastrous.  The word disastrous is not chosen lightly, as, in the case of Argentina, among  many others, there is a direct impact of water provision on child mortality  rates. These potential ramifications of insufficient competition on the water  market partially explain the reluctance to privatize it. Monopoly and oligarchy  situations are more likely when the fixed costs of the activity are high and  when the infrastructure needed is considerable, because high fixed costs make  exiting and entering the market more difficult, leading to static prices.  However, to the extent that hydrocoli needs no specific infrastructure, and as the costs are exclusively linked to  research and development, this technology makes privatization an easier  alternative and guarantees competitive prices, assuming of course that the  relevant intellectual property is rendered open-source. These characteristics  of hydrocoli mean that when reliance  on the State fails, water treatment can be privatized efficiently, cheaply, and  quickly.
The characteristics that make hydrocoli easy to privatize also make it  possible to create self-sufficient agricultural systems in rural areas. Farmers  could set up a hydrocoli facility,  thus having access to clean water and organic fertilizer with little or no  transportation costs. Quasi abandoned areas could thus return to their former  state of agricultural and economic activity.
Rural exodus and brain drain  are often linked to the isolation of an area from networks which we take for  granted, including the internet, electric grids, gas mains and water  facilities. An area which is without these and without the means to build them  tends to become more and more cut-off from the hyper-centers and consequently  from any and all economic activity. The possibility of creating an autonomous  agricultural system could reduce rural exodus, often linked to insufficient  water provision for agriculture, and hence the problems that go with massive  emigration on the one hand, and immigration on the other. Problems linked to  emigration include a collapse of the local economy, brought on by an  insufficient labor supply. This is particularly true when you take into account  the fact that the demographic faction that is most likely to leave is young  people, who are also the strongest workers. Immigration can cause over-taxation  of a city’s resources which the authorities do not have the means to deal with.  This can be linked to the formation of ghettos and an inefficient waste treatment  system which in turn are linked to the spread of disease.  Brain drain can also lead to a flooding of  the labor markets in certain areas, which can threaten workers’ rights through  the increase in the number of people competing for a single job. From a  Keynesian point of view, a decrease in wages and hence spending power can lead  to an economic slump. In contrast, the decrease in rural exodus is linked to the  development of areas that are currently marginalized or even forgotten, thus  curbing a phenomenon which is a serious economic drain.
In conclusion, we do not for a  moment doubt that in the face of increasing deregulation and water scarcity,  the characteristics of hydrocoli or  similar water treatment biotechnologies will make it the most efficient choice  in terms of costs, public health, sustainability and safety. We hope that in  this perhaps small way we may contribute to a safer and more egalitarian  future.
 
Conclusions
 
Our proposed goal was to show  how issues stemming from synthetic biology were taking showing up in various  fields. We hope to have reached this goal. The field of synthetic biology  remains a closed one, and the details are still mysterious for a large portion  of the public. However, thanks to international events where synthetic biology  takes center stage, such as IGEM, it is becoming more familiar to people  outside the field. As we have seen, there are numerous issues, more every day,  that must be resolved. This process is difficult but society as a whole must  reach for the light at the end of the tunnel.
The birth of a new scientific  discipline and its road towards becoming commonplace must be dealt with  responsibly in order for humanity to benefit without causing damage to the  environment. This must include education, and, more importantly, consultation,  of the general public because it is consumers who ultimately make a technology  successful or not. Researchers, as well as the guardians of bio-safety and  bio-security, must also take responsibility to ensure that uncontrolled and  dangerous dissemination of these technologies is not possible.  Just as certain plants have both healing and  dangerous properties, synthetic biology can benefit humanity, or damage  humanity if misused. Our position is neither alarmist nor utopian; in fact, a  happy medium between technophobia and technophilia must be struck, especially  when dealing with such highly complex matters as those concerned by synthetic  biology.
We firmly believe that this  technology has the power to do good, all the while bringing significant  financial returns to investors. This can happen if, and only if, those  responsible for its commercialization and implementation proceed with caution. On  the one hand, from a human point of view, caution must be used in the face of ethical  concerns, safety and the economic analysis of humanitarian aid. While they must  be addressed, these concerns will not even have the opportunity to see the  light of day if the product is not successfully commercialized. From a  commercial point of view, care must be taken to avoid the pitfalls of negative  consumer attitudes and culture shock, leading to the rejection and hence the  failure of the innovation.
