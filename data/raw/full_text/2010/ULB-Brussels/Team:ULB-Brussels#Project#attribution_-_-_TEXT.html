Attribution & contribution
The host lab never worked on hydrogen production; it helped with basic protocols and materials. It works with toxin-antitoxin systems, which gave us the idea to use one to kill the escaping bacteria.
The advisors Laurence Van Melderen, Johan Timmermans and Gilles Vanwalleghem helped with the design and refinements of the project; they also gave technical advices. Pierre-Alexandre Drèze brought his technical expertise to our PCRs and manipulation of E.coli.
All the students were involved in the choice of project and design; Justine Laverdeur, Baptiste Dumont,Aurelie Merckx, Thomas Gosset, Denis Loozen, Alix Delville, Maxime Iwaszko, Hubert Michaux were the wetlab team and tried to build this awesome machine.
Jonathan Frisch and Justine Laverdeur worked on modeling of hydrogen production and cell death
Eleanor Miller, Yasemin Onal and Quentin Hiernaux were our extra-scientific experts, working on the human practice and economic part of the project.
