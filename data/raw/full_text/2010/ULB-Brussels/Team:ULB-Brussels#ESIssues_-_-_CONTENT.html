We believe that if synthetic  biology is to become a part of our daily lives, it is necessary to expand  research to questions which are raised by this field but cannot be answered  within this field. In this way we hope new perspectives can be explored outside  of the usual and often restrictive frame of reference of “hard” science.
  The <EM>hydrocoli</EM> strain that the  ULB Brussels team has been working on for IGEM is designed to produce energy  from waste. Specifically, the research concerns the production of <EM>hydrogen</EM> (in exploitable quantities)  from <EM>wastewater</EM>. If the project is  successful, Jules Verne’s “Coal of the future” may  well be water, not as a composite body, but as the vehicle of the components  from which hydrogen can be harvested. 
  This  project has far reaching implications.   The fact that it focuses on the treatment of wastewaters and the  production of clean energy means that it has potential repercussions which go  above and beyond the scientific merit of the challenge. This is why a more  pluridisciplinary approach seemed necessary. 
  This paper, which will examine the non-scientific issues surrounding the  project, is made up of five parts. We begin with an examination of the ethical  and philosophical questions raised by <EM>hydrocoli</EM>.  This first chapter includes a brief explanation of the project in laymen’s  terms: as it was written by philosophy and economics students, we wanted it to  be accessible to our peers. Moreover, it is important to render the content of  this type of competition accessible to anyone who is interested, particularly  as biotechnologies concern everyone. The chapter on ethics also includes a  cursory overview of the possibilities for humanitarian aid. This is developed  more in depth in the fifth chapter, which is concerned with the possible  economic consequences of its implementation. Chapter 2 concerns a pragmatic  aspect of ethics, bio-safety, and includes a brief overview of the relevant  legislation. Chapter 3 examines issues of property rights. Property rights, as a  field which concerns both ethics and economics, makes an ideal segue into  chapter 4, which examines the marketing of <EM>hydrocoli </EM>and of the products of biotechnology in general. The last chapter, as we  mentioned, explores the economic possibilities of the implementation of <EM>hydrocoli.</EM>
  For the purposes of this paper, we consider all the potential  ramifications of the project, including those which may not be an issue in the  immediate future. The importance of this approach needs no explanation in the  wake if such ecological catastrophes as the hole in the ozone layer. As the  saying has it, “better safe than sorry”. Besides the ethical reasons for this  approach, the importance of taking into consideration every conceivable  consequence, be it a question of an ethical, philosophical, economic, social or  ecological nature, cannot be overstated if we hope for a successful use of <EM>hydrocoli</EM> in the future. A complete  analysis of the project is thus a useful tool for our team if we hope to see  our research applied one day. </P><P> </P><GH2><A name="_Toc275816601">Ethical  and Philosophical aspects of the implementation of <EM>Hydrocoli</EM></A></GH2><P> </P><P><STRONG><EM>&quot; Oui,  mes amis, je crois que l'eau sera employée un jour comme combustible, que  l'hydrogène et l'oxygène qui la composent, utilisés ensemble ou séparément,  fourniront une source inépuisable de chaleur et de lumière, et d'une intensité  que la houille ne saurait avoir.

We will then go on to explore the possible applications  in terms of humanitarian aid and energy production. Lastly, we will take a more  purely philosophical approach, exploring the implications of biotechnologies  for Man’s place in the world through a heuristic approach.               
  In order for the reader to understand the full implications of certain  technicalities, it is essential to introduce a minimum of scientific lingo.  Three of the technical aspects of the project bear mentioning for the purposes  of this paper:</P><UL><LI>The use of <EM>Escherichia coli</EM><A href="#box1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><STRONG>[1]</STRONG></A>as the  bacterial base. </LI><LI>The fact  that this new strain of E coli will aim at providing a complete water treatment  process, through the inclusion of several modules, such as cellular death or  heavy metal detection.  </LI><LI>The  association of wastewater treatment with hydrogen<A href="#box2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2] </A> production. </LI></UL><P>These three aspects are important for several reasons:
  Firstly, because the use of E. coli as a base makes our modified  strain easy to use and to improve upon: E. coli is the best-known and most  commonly used bacterium in laboratory research. </P><DIV align="center"><TABLE width="500" border="1" cellspacing="0"><TBODY><TR><TD><P><EM>* Escherichia coli: </EM></P><P><EM>E Coli is originally present in the digestive systems of mammals .In  people it makes up 80% of the aerobic flora.

Escherich) and because its culture is so easy: cellular division takes place  every 20 minutes at 37°. The genetic makeup of non-pathogenetic laboratory E  Coli was entirely sequenced by 1997. These characteristics make this bacterium  the perfect tool for research in molecular biology</EM></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P> </P><P>
  Secondly,  developing and exploiting this bacterium is not costly in terms of time or  money because the technology needed is not particularly sophisticated. This is  an important advantage for <EM>hydrocoli </EM>when  compared with other water treatment processes. 
  Thirdly,  the fact that, through synthetic biology, E. coli can be modified to include  new characteristics is a non-negligible advantage. This makes it possible to  transform E. coli into a strain capable of breaking down and neutralizing most  matters commonly found in wastewater. 
  Your run-of-the-mill strain of E. coli  can break down certain matters that are commonly found in waste. However, the  modified strain will be able to break down organic matters such as cellulose,  signify the presence of heavy metals<A href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3] </A> (perhaps even denitrify its environment<A href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</A>)  and even eliminate methanogeneous bacteria which would otherwise curb the  production of hydrogen by consuming said hydrogen through fermentation.  Having said this, if we are to follow the  precautionary principle<A href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</A>, it is safer to repress the methanogenous bacteria  than to destroy them. In this case, following the precautionary principle means  preserving biodiversity in the environment surrounding the water treatment  facility. In fact, certain bacteria which we could inadvertently destroy could  be essential components of the eco-system at the exit of the water treatment  facility.  </P><DIV align="center"><TABLE border="1" cellspacing="0"><TBODY><TR><TD width="551"><P><EM><STRONG> Hydrogen and its many advantages:</STRONG></EM></P><P><EM>-  </EM><EM>    The hydrogen atom is one of  the most abundant on Earth.</EM><EM>-      Dihydrogenous combustion is  very energetic (120MJ/kg, or 2, 2 times more than natural gas. 1kg H2 = 33, 33 KWh = 120 MJ = 2,855 kg petroleum  equivalent).</EM>

  If we were to opt for the elimination of the  methanogenous bacteria, 10% of the water would have to be left in its natural  state in order to preserve the biodiversity of the water source at the exit of  the utility. Either way, precautions must be taken to preserve biodiversity  because, as well as being an essential ethical principle, the preservation of  biodiversity is a legal imperative. 
  The destruction of the E. coli strain after it has completed its tasks  can be integrated as an automatic fail-safe into the bacterium itself,  increasing its practicality and avoiding contamination risks. The risk of  polluting the outside environment and modifying the eco-system are thus  practically non-existent thanks to the poison-antidote system which the  engineers are attempting to put into place in the cellular-death module.
  The modification of E. coli in such a way as to give it the ability to  fulfill several functions presents real advantages when compared to traditional  water purification methods. Traditional methods require several different  bacteria that must be monitored in a purification station. This is clearly a  more complex, and therefore more costly, method.
  Lastly, this strain is also modified in such a way as to produce  hydrogen while fulfilling its other tasks. The production of hydrogen will be  integrated into the water treatment system and it would be produced using the  elements broken down from the waste present in the water. Moreover, synthetic  biology actually makes it possible to increase the strain’s production capacity  (by deactivation and over expression of certain genes) making it a possible  cost-effective alternative to current energy generation methods. At this point,  the team lacks sufficient information concerning energy production rates but it  is very likely that the energy produced will at least be sufficient to run the  treatment facility. Moreover, it is a very real possibility that the amount of  hydrogen produced would exceed the amount necessary for a self-sustaining  utility. The excess hydrogen could then be stored in sufficient quantities for  domestic and/or industrial use. Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that  even if the hydrogen production rates are small at first, our strain is a  prototype that can be improved upon in the future. In any case, this project  signifies real progress on an ecological and environmental front. No matter  what the levels of hydrogen produced, any gain of energy in the process of  waste treatment is in fact progress. 
  Hydrogen is non-polluting and its combustion emits only steam but this  does not mean that hydrogen production techniques are environmentally sound. For  an energy source to be truly clean, the production process itself must be  clean. The most promising technologies are those which do not create any  carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide because greenhouse gases are currently our most  pressing concern. Our outlined method thus presents a serious advantage when  compared to other methods because it creates no greenhouse gases at any point. <EM>Hydrocoli</EM> is even more advantageous than most energy sources that fall under the heading  “renewable”. For example, the production of electricity through photovoltaic  panels or windmills is less advantageous, qualitatively speaking, because the  infrastructure relies on polluting or exhaustible resources, such as terbium,  dysprosium and neodymium which are ‘rare earths’<A href="#box3" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</A>.  When you add the fact that the maximum period of exploitation of these  technologies is not sufficiently long to justify their energy costs, it is  clear that they are not energy solutions for the long term. The  aforementioned problems are non existent with technologies which rely on  synthetic biology because it uses living elements, bacteria, which produce  absolutely no waste and are exploitable in existing infrastructures. 
  Besides the advantages for energy production, <EM>hydrocoli </EM>could have positive consequences for water access: new  filtering and purification facilities that run with technologies relying on  synthetic biology could revolutionize humanitarian aid and development. Running  water is so common in industrialized nations as to be taken frequently for  granted, but in developing countries water is an extremely problematic issue,  so much so that the United Nations made “the decrease by half of the percentage  of the population without access to drinking water<A href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</A> or basic cleaning facilities” one of their urgent “goals for the Millennium<A href="#box4" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</A>”  to be reached by 2015. Furthermore, the issue of access to drinking water goes  hand in hand with the issue of the purification of wastewater.  In fact, contaminated water is responsible  for the deaths of 5000 children per day (one death every twenty seconds) and ingested  wastewater can cause diarrhea, making it is the main cause of mortality in  children under five.
              The ubiquitous and difficult nature  of the wastewater treatment problem arises from its complexity. The fixed costs  of water purification are huge, meaning developing areas do not have access to  the kind of global water treatment means that are commonplace in the west. This  is why the development of our simple water treatment technology could have a  revolutionary effect on humanitarian aid. 
  Indeed, the infrastructure needed is  minimal, making this technology potentially cost-effective and easy to use for  groups on a small scale, such as families. Water purity is a problem especially  in warm weather areas, because that is where bacteria survive and breed. Our  innovation in fact takes advantage of this fact, because the modified strain of  E. coli is well-suited to just such areas. </P><TABLE width="500" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TD><P align="center">
      Rare earths </P><P>These are chemical metallic elements extracted from minerals. This  category includes scandium, yttrium and 15 lanthanides. The elements have  particular properties and are highly coveted in the alternative energy  development field. 
    Terbium, dysprosium and neodymium are lanthanides used in hybrid cars,  in wind turbine generators and in solar technology. Their demand is constantly  growing. This poses a serious problem. It is estimated that terbium 65 stocks  will be depleted in 2012. Moreover, mines where they are extracted are often  extremely polluting. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>
  Another major water contamination problem arises due to the absence of  toilets. Once our technology is implemented, wastewater could be evacuated and  treated on the spot even in the most isolated areas. 
  The difficulty of access to clean water is an important factor for  economic development because the difficult task of finding water takes several  hours a day. Generally the task falls to women and children, who may miss  several hours of school fulfilling the chore.
  Access to clean water is also absolutely essential in the fight against  many diseases which can be simply eradicated if adequate wastewater facilities  are provided. Currently, water purification tablets or filters are distributed  by several NGO’s but these methods don’t have the added economic and social  value of the implementation of a water utility and an integrated distribution  circuit and are not a long term solution because reliance on foreign aid  creates new problems.
  The ideal end result of our team’s project would be the easy  installation of a water network, on any scale (village, city, country) through  the implementation of small purification centers. The water purification would  be linked to the production of electricity from hydrogen for areas that are cut  off from the main energy networks. In this way and on a local scale, these  utilities could provide clean water and energy from a self-sustaining source.
  The  possibilities for developing countries are the driving force behind this idea,  but this technology is also potentially very advantageous for industrialized  nations. We have already mentioned the advantages of this technology when  compared to traditional methods. In addition to those characteristics which  were already mentioned, E. coli has the added particularity of treating  nitrates and heavy metals which are more particular to industrial nations.  Due to the vast quantities of wastewater in  industrials lands, one can also imagine that water treatment would create a  hydrogen surplus which could be used for industry.
  For  almost a century, petrol has dominated the energy sector and hence many industrial  sectors, notably transport. Developing alternatives is difficult in the face of  the petroleum monopoly, especially when it comes to classical methods of  producing hydrogen which are not as cost-effective as fossil fuels.  However, synthetic biology gives us another  way to produce hydrogen, but, unlike other ways, it is actually potentially  competitive enough to make serious headway on the energy market.  
  The  IGEM competition may fulfill a valuable role in encouraging the development of  alternatives to traditional methods which always involve a trade-off between  financial costs and environmental costs. Could it be that with synthetic  biology we could have our cake and eat it too?</P><TABLE width="500" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TD><STRONG><EM>Millenium  goals</EM></STRONG><EM>The 189 members of the  UN have set a series of objectives to be reached by 2015:</EM><EM>Reducing extreme  poverty and hunger.</EM><EM>Ensuring primary  school level education for all.</EM><EM>Promoting sexual  equality and the autonomy of woman.</EM><EM> Reducing child mortality rates.</EM><EM>Tackling the health  conditions for childbirth.</EM><EM> Tackling HIV, AIDS, and a series of other  illnesses.</EM><EM> Promoting sustainable development.</EM><EM>Putting into place a  world-wide partnership for promoting development.</EM><EM>These 8 objectives are  specified in quantitative terms; for example, </EM><EM>reducing unemployment  or poverty by a specific percentage.</EM></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P> </P><P>If  we put aside ethical and ecological concerns for the moment, we can see that  industry and other profit seeking activities can also be conquered by this  technology (for further development, see chapter 4). All the concerned parties  could continue to pursue their selfish interests without doing damage to each  other. This could lead to the deconstruction of the traditional polarization of  industry and ecology, at least where energetic resources are concerned. If we  were to philosophically deconstruct these opposed poles, developing this  alternative could even reduce the traditional gulf between the corporate  world’s interests and philanthropic interests. 
  It  must be said though that the ideas developed here are not meant to be  normative. We are fully aware of the dangers of idealism, and mentioning all  the possibilities of this technology is merely a way to underline its potential  power. Moreover, the mention of this deconstruction of the polar opposition is  pure speculation and aims at highlighting the latent strength of the concept of  a society governed by the production of clean hydrogen. In practice, this kind  of social revolution is not likely and could even lead to concerns about  utopianism. If positive change is possible, it will come about little by  little, taking the form of a trend rather than a complete discontinuity. Indeed,  sudden and extreme social change is usually best avoided. 
  As we have seen, the ethical issues are numerous. Philosophically, there  is also much to be said. In fact, if this technology were to be rendered  functional, it could change the position of the human subject in his  environment. Currently, when it comes to ecological concerns, the traditional  distinction between Nature (and its flora and fauna) and Man is as follows:  Nature, as opposed to Man, produces no waste; everything changes but nothing is  lost. Nature is a delicately balanced system which is constantly recycled and  renewed. Philosophically, Man can be seen as the element which breaks nature’s  cycle, disturbing the system. This rupture with his environment is one of Man’s  essential characteristics and can be linked to a self-consciousness which is  constructed in opposition to what is outside of the self. 
  The awareness of being an element in the environment is a fundamental  difference between Man and plants and animals. Plants and animals can be seen  as one with their environment, the essential building blocks that make up  Nature. Animals live in an ecosystem to which they are indebted. They live in  the ecosystem, but are also a part of the ecosystem, as essential to its make  up as trees to that of a forest. In contrast, Man does not pay tribute to a  specific ecosystem; he does not even live in an ecosystem, in the strictest  sense of the word. An ecosystem is defined as follows: “the association of a  community of living species (biocenos) and a physical environment (biotope) in  constant interaction with each other”<A href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</A>.  Man has managed to adapt to almost every type  of weather and geographic conditions. However, even if not indebted to a  specific environment, Man, as an inhabitant of planet Earth, depends on the environment,  taken as a whole. 
  Nature can be compared to a huge perequation in which all the elements  are constantly adjusting to maintain equilibrium. In this metaphor, Man is the  unknown quantity which disturbs the equilibrium. The fact that Man produces  waste is the crucial issue here. The idea of waste itself is entirely  anthropocentric, as made up of artificial or artifactual and thus non-natural  objects. Generally, waste refers to everything that nature can not break down  and recycle in order to achieve its all important equilibrium. The vast  majority of these elements are byproducts of Man’s activities. 
  If we were to push our team’s project to its logical conclusion, we  would witness a new paradigm for the conceptual place Man can occupy in Nature.  In fact, the almost complete treatment of waste present in used water is used  here to produce energy directly, reproducing the kind of self-sustaining cycle  found in nature.  Through the decrease of  the direct exploitation of natural resources and of the quantity of waste, Man  can minimize the disequilibrium that he creates in the system.   To go back to our comparison, Man could then  create a new equilibrium in which he plays a part comparable to that of other  species. He would then tend towards the equilibrium of a new system on an  individual scale, rather than throwing the entire global system out of order,  and what is a system at rest but the sum of its sub-systems which are all at  rest? To return to our  metaphor, we can now say that Man could reach the optimal equilibrium in his  own system, contributing to maintaining, and not destroying, the natural system  which is an extremely complex equation. 
  From this point, we can go on to a more heuristic philosophical  development. If we accept the conclusions of the previous paragraph, their  counterfactual is also true, implying that the disturbance of each sub-system  can disturb the system, in this case, Nature, as a whole. This somewhat basic  and obvious axiom makes it possible to develop a prospective reflection based  on a fear heuristic<A href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</A>.  What this means is projecting ourselves into a future, more or less distant, by  imagining the various consequences that may arise from the current situation.  To a certain extent, this method is commonly used, notably in climate studies.  The real philosophical interest here however lies in the interpretation of the  results from an extra-scientific point of view.   Basically, this consists in taking into consideration the results of our  thought experiment from a human standpoint and not merely from the Cartesian  standpoint. This method can be seen as a sort of philosophical modelization. 
  If we imagine the future and the result is fear or anxiety, the future  we are headed for must be contrary to the aspirations of humanity. This is true  because fear has proven to be the most efficient tool when it comes to avoiding  the pitfalls of utopianism and hubris. If we take the current parameters of  resource exploitation and the resulting pollution and interpret them, from a  purely scientific point of view, to imagine the coming century, what we have  may be sustainable for the human race but instills fear in our hearts. While we  may manage to survive in a world where the air is compromised, the weather  thrown out of whack and the majority of animal and vegetable species destroyed,  the picture this paints is met with horror. 
  This alone is a sufficient reason to make an effort to escape the  terrible inertia which pulls us closer and closer to the center of the  ecological black hole, to the point of no return. Patching up the wooden leg  that we are currently standing on will not help us; our inertia must be  reversed as soon as possible. Despite this urgency, the current trend is to  follow an ostrich policy, as evidenced by the continued massive exploitation of  non-renewable fossil fuels, the use of which is already compromised itself and  may soon compromise our very existence.  
  While it may seem that we have gotten off track, we believe that IGEM  and our project specifically are directly linked to the energy and  environmental issue, as they offer alternatives which are infinitely more  advantageous than what is currently on the table. The beginnings of this  project which concerns waste and hydrogen are a wonderful way to address, and  perhaps even resolve, two of the major problems of the 21st century:  the energy crisis and the intimately linked need to reduce pollution. By  encouraging research in this area through the development of our prototype we  hope to reconcile these two staggeringly huge challenges and solve them  together. </P><P> </P><GH2><A name="_Toc275816602">Bio-safety,  bio-security and synthetic biology</A></GH2><P> </P><P>Besides the ethical analysis  that any genetic modification project demands for deontological reasons, the  IGEM competition requires that we take the ethics of synthetic biology into  account on a more formal level through the analysis of bio-safety and  bio-security.  
  Bio-security is an issue which  stems directly from bioethics. It refers to a series of established procedures  designed to avoid the sanitary problems that can arise from synthetic biology  and that are called into play by ethical concerns. Bio-security gives us the  legal framework which is necessary to preserve the environment and public  health in the face of the possibility of misuse. 
  Legally speaking, bio-security  refers only to genetic engineering involving genetically modified organisms or  pathogenetic organisms. In Belgium, bio-security regulation falls under the  heading of work environment safety but bio-security and bio-safety standards  vary from country to country. There are however some which are enforced on a  European level or internationally. 
  In practice, bio-regulation is  enforced by the prevention council and the bio-security head. The law requires  that every laboratory where genetic modification or the use of pathogenetic  organisms take place must appoint people to fill the two aforementioned  positions. The legislation also requires the existence of a local bio-security  committee whose job is to deal with the daily problems faced by the relevant  institutions.  Belgian law doesn’t  contain specific requirements concerning the composition of these committees,  but they are generally made up of professionals who work in the field. </P><P>First thing, all laboratories  must obtain an environment license, delivered by the competent regional  authorities, before they can begin operations. The authorization is delivered  after appraisal by the Bio-security and Bio-technology Service, a federal body.  As an example of the concepts and instruments relevant to bio-safety we will  now discuss the procedure that a lab must follow in Belgium. 
  Firstly,  any installation where a confined activity involving micro-organisms or  dangerous or modified organisms takes place must register with the competent  regional authority. According to the installation and the level of risk of the  activity, the business may need written authorization. Moreover, a legal decree  stipulates that any request for an environmental license must include a risk  evaluation of the research to be conducted. The SBB then plays the role of  technical expert and expresses an opinion on the risk evaluation. The SBB  report must be given in with the licensing request. The file containing all the  relevant information for a notification of confined use constitutes the  bio-security report. 
  In  order to make the information and authorization procedures easier and to reduce  the amount of paperwork, the SBB has come up with notification forms and a  user’s guide. These are based on the relevant legislation but also on field experience  in applying the laws. 
  Before beginning a new  research project, the researchers must complete a detailed description of the  project and its goals. Their description is then the object of a risk  evaluation. The level of risk is measured on a scale going from 1 to 4. This  risk estimate is based on the type of organism used (inoffensive bacteria,  animal, virus, etc) and on the goals that the research is aiming for. The risk  evaluation aims at identifying risks intrinsic to the activity but also the  possible consequences for Man, for flora and fauna or for the environment  generally speaking (for example, when using bacteria which are essential to  biodiversity or in preserving topology). </P><P>The protection of the  environment has its own enforcers, the environmental inspection agency, which  is responsible for checking licenses and authorizations: the inspectors are  authorized to seal a laboratory if it has been found guilty of illegal  research.  Refusing to respect the  sealing order can lead to punishment and even to imprisonment of the guilty  party. Belgian bio-security and safety legislation was reviewed in 2002, as was  the legislation concerning environmental licensing. 
  In addition to the regulation  concerning laboratory research, the development of genetically engineered  organisms for industrial use requires a specific authorization process.  Specific emergency and intervention measures have been established for  genetically modified micro-organisms. These procedures can be implemented  quickly thanks to the information contained in the forms that the researchers  must fill out before beginning activities. This information is in fact crucial  in case of emergency and includes such essential points as the type of  organisms being modified, the safety measures of the lab, quantity, etc. 
  The policies we have listed  are largely applications of European Union directives. EU directives  are mainly established to avoid one country having to suffer the  consequences of a neighboring country’s activities, for example in the case of  contamination through the exchange of goods. A number of international treaties  have also been put into place, along with the mutual control needed to ensure  that they are respected. This type of regulation is necessary if these treaties  are to be respected, and their enforcement is in everyone’s interest, as  bacteriological contamination, once started, is virtually impossible to  control. The relevant legislation on an international level is contained in the  “Cartagena Protocol”.
  This protocol was ratified by  the UN in 2000 and has been active since 2003. It aims at avoiding  biotechnological risks and at gathering the data concerning these risks on an  international level thanks to an information exchange center. This center  encourages transparency and accessibility of information, allowing for example  for a healthier and more efficient management of commercial activity in  developing countries. 
  The Cartagena protocol demands  respect of the precautionary and prevention principles in the absence of  scientific certainties in order to limit the risk. This is an understandable  precaution because these risks, in certain cases, as in the development of GMOs  for industrial use, could have repercussions that resonate on a national scale  or beyond.    To put it another way,  French law puts it as follows: “the absence of certitude, given a specific  state of scientific and technical knowledge, should not slow down the  implementation of effective and appropriate measures which aim at avoiding  serious and irreversible damage for the environment at a reasonable cost”. 
  The precautionary principle  entered into the legislation in 1992. It is not merely a philosophical concept,  but a normative imperative. Let us add that legally no one is authorized to  manipulate organisms for pathogenetic goals, not even defense forces.  Bacteriological weaponry is thus an area of research which is theoretically  forbidden by law. 
  Bio-security and bio-safety  norms include, beyond the legal aspects, a series of more technical directives  aimed at the scientists who conduct laboratory research. These directives are  the practical applications of the federal law on a more concrete level. They  are mainly concerned with the management of biological decontamination.  Biological decontamination involves treating air through the use of specific  filters, treating liquid which may contain biocide solutions or detergents, the  treatment of solids which must be incinerated and the treatment of elements  which may be radioactive. 
  Despite these measures, zero  risk situations do not exist. This is one of the reasons why it is so all  important to evaluate and compute the risks. The precautionary principle is  always meant to be applied in the field of biotechnology because the  technicians are working with organisms which are often invisible to the naked  eye and which can be dangerous because of their instability. 
  The bio-safety manual and the  waste elimination manual are two deontological guides which include the legal  imperatives to be respected when conducting research.  They are not included in interior law but are  necessary for the correct application of the directives in a specific  institution.
  This concise section on bio-safety and  security is meant to be a short guided tour of the different practices in use.  The extent of the measures concerned shows us to what extent biotechnologies  are supervised. The most important point is to ensure that bio-safety is not  taken lightly because inadequate risk management could lead to a catastrophe  the likes of which we’ve never seen. It remains true that synthetic biology has  much to offer us but in order to ensure that it does not become a poisoned  chalice, it is important to be careful. Norms and a surveillance and  peer-review principle are essential tools in avoiding the misuse of science.  The risk of instrumentalization is particularly present in the case of  synthetic biology because this is a relatively young field. This means it  remains obscure for many but is ever more ubiquitous. Bio-safety and  bio-security regulations are absolutely necessary if we are to avoid, inasmuch  as possible, scenarios in which a sorcerer’s apprentice or mad scientist would  have the ability to create a diabolical alchemy involving the worst poisons and  most ravaging plagues.</P><DIV><DIV id="ftn3"><P> [3]The detection of heavy metals is prefered to bioaccumulation  because it presents less environmental risk.
