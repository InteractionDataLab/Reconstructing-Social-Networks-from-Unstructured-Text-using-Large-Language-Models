1. Construction of Chimeric AIP Receptor BACK
Johnsborg, et al.  reported in his study that the transmembrane  domain, other than the cytoplasmic domain, of a pheromone receptor would be  responsible for the inducing specificity of corresponding signal molecules [ 1 ]. A fusion  AIP sensor, AgrC (transmembrane domain) - PlnB (cytoplasmic catalytic domain),  is designed to sense AIP molecules released by S.aureus and thereby activate Lactobacillus endogenous response regulators.
We fused the  transmembrane domain of AgrC (amino acid 1-188, AIP receptor in S.aureus) with the cytoplasmic HPK  domain of PlnB (amino acid 212-441, pheromone receptor in L.plantarum WCFS1). The fusion point is Leucine, a conserved amino  acid in both AgrC and PlnB (186 in AgrC/212 in PlnB), linking the transmembrane  domain and cytoplasmic HPK domain. The AgrC-PlnB chimeric receptor was cloned  into the multiple cloning site of e.coli  - Lactobacillus shuttle vector pMG36e, which contains a constitutive  promoter P32.
2. Localization Test of Chimeric AIP Receptor BACK
To  first examine the proper localization of AgrC-PlnB on the membrane of L. plantarum WCFS1, coding sequence of  fluorescence protein mCherry was added after the chimeric receptor AgrC-PlnB. Since  the N terminal of AgrC and PlnB is putatively associated with membrane  localization, mCherry is fused at C terminal of the fusion construct, as  denoted below:
The localization  test will be performed by observing pMG36e-transformed L. plantarum WCFS1 under fluorescence microscope.
3. Functionality Test of the Chimeric AIP Receptor BACK
Experiment 1: Test in L.plantarum WCFS1
The GusA reporter  assay will be used in testing the functionality of the chimeric receptor AgrC-PlnB  in L. plantarum WCFS1. A gusA  reporter unit consisting of an inducible plnA promoter and a gusA reporter gene  was cloned into pMG36e at upstream of P32 promoter; the agrC/agrC-plnB was  cloned into the multiple cloning site of pMG36e which is at the downstream of  P32 promoter. As for the control groups, an empty pMG36e and a pMG36e which  1has only the gusA reporter unit were prepared. The construct-inserted shuttle  vectors will then be transformed into L.  plantarum WCFS1.
Each of the four  groups aforementioned will be treated by 1) AIP (inducing peptide for S. aureus) induction 2) IP (inducing  peptide for Lactobacillus) induction  and 3) control without pheromone induction.
Due to the  existence of endogenous pln locus in L. plantarum WCFS1, response regulator  PlnC would possibly bind to the plnA promoter in shuttle vector pMG36e as well  as the plnA promoter in L. plantarum WCFS1  genomic DNA. PlnA in the genomic DNA would then synthesize inducing peptides IP,  which could bind to the original transmembrane sensor PlnB. Consequently,  phosphorylated PlnC would result in background noise for testing our designed  constructs. In another word, the natural pathway of pln quorum sensing and the introduced pathway of AIP signal transduction  would interfere with each other; the gusA expression level could not directly  indicate the response from chimeric AIP sensor.
Once synthesized IP, synthesized AIP or placebo was applied, GusA expression level would be examined every 1 hour for consecutive 10 hours. Group 3)  is expected to give the highest level of gusA expression among all AIP-induced groups.
Experiment 2: Test in L.sakei Lb790
To  reduce the noise brought by the cross talk between the natural pathway of pln quorum sensing and the introduced  pathway of AIP signal transduction, modified constructs will be built and  transformed into L. sakei Lb790, a Lactobacillus strain which does not have  the pln locus. A new part of plnC  following RBS is added to the construct to enable the proper signal  transduction.
GusA expression  level will be measured 3 hours after pheromone induction. Compared with the  control groups, the chimeric receptor AgrC-PlnB would be proved to be  functional if the GusA expression was comparatively high.
4. Construction of RIP Production Cassette BACK
An expression cassette (Construct 1) is designed to express the hybrid  peptide DD13-RIP and drive its secretion to extracellular environment. A signal  peptide is introduced to the construct to direct the secretion process since  there is no evidence showing that DD13-RIP can be automatically secreted out by L. plantarum. Another construct (Construct 2), with only  P32 promoter and the hybrid peptide DD13-RIP, serves as a control for the test.
Construct 1 consists of signal peptide lp_0297, a linker and the hybrid  peptide DD13-RIP. The whole construct is cloned into plasmid pMG36e, a shuttle  vector in E. coli and Lactobacilli [ 2 ]. P32 promoter, a constitutive  promoter in E. coli and L. plantarum is located at the upstream  of this construct [ 3 , 4 ]. Signal peptide lp_0297 is selected here due to its  high efficiency in secreting peptides and proteins in L. plantarum WCFS1 [ 5 ]. The linker is to ensure that the separation  of signal peptide and hybrid peptide DD13 – RIP operates well and does not  affect the normal function of the hybrid peptide. The original terminator in pMG36e will stop  the transcription process. The whole construct is under the regulation of P32  promoter and the aforementioned terminator.
5. Secretion Test of Hybrid Inhibiting Peptides BACK
Since the hybrid peptide DD13-RIP is a 21-residue peptide, for which the secretion efficiency of lp_0297 is unknown, a function test is designed to determine the secretion efficiency. Two constructs will be made in this experiment:
In both constructs, FLAG-tag is added before hybrid  peptide DD13-RIP. After transformation and selection, L. plantarum containing either Construct 2 or 3 will be harvested  at the late exponential or early stationary phase. Western blot will be applied  to examine the amount of peptide secreted.
6. Bio-assay of the Reporter Plasmid BACK
Plasmid pRN6683, a P3-blaZ fusion plasmid serving as a  reporter gene of RNAIII, is commonly used in bio-assay for RNAIII synthesis [ 6 ] P3 promoter in AgrBDCA system is the promoter of RNAIII, and blaZ is a S. aureus β-lactamase encoding gene [ 7 ] With  P3 promoter and blaZ gene, pRN6683 could reflect the activity level of RNAIII  by synthesizing β-lactamase. The activity of β-lactamase is measured by through  its reaction with nitrocefin [ 8 ].
Both pRN6683-transformed and normal S. aureus strains are exposed to  nitrocefin in early exponential phase [ 8 ]. The cells are then harvested for optical density  test. Only pRN6683-transformed cells are expected to have strong degradation effect  on nitrocefin.
After confirming the positive transformation of  reporter plasmid pRN6683, bio-assay of DD13-RIP can be conducted. According to  the methods described above, the supernatant of L. plantarum (transformed with Construct 1 and 2) will be added to S. aureus culture (transformed with  pRN6683) at their early exponential stage [ 6 , 9 ]. A standard curve of the concentration decrease  of nitrocefin vs. time can be used to estimate the inhibitive effect of  DD13-RIP.
7. Functionality Test of Hybrid Inhibiting Peptides BACK
Both Construct 1 and 2 are also designed to test the inhibitive effect on RNAIII of secreted DD13-RIP. These two constructs will determine the secretion and function of DD13-RIP. After replacing P32 promoter with plnA promoter, this new construct will be made into a new construct with the chimeric AIP receptor.
