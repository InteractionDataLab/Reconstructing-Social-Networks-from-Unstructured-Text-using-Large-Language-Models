Hi folks!
Welcome to HKUST Team Wiki Page!
We are the 2010 iGEM team from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) . This is the third year for HKUST to participate in this international synthetic biology competition.
On this Wiki page, we are presenting how synthetic biology could contribute to health and medical studies. We are here introducing an idea – an interspecies quorum-quenching system in which non-pathogenic Lactobacillus could sense and reduce the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus. Such a model system should not yield a strong selective pressure for development of resistance, and would therefore be an attractive concept for preventive medicine.

Thanks to our experienced instructors, considerate advisors and every team member from HKUST iGEM 2010 family, we enjoyed a fantastic summer working cooperatively and effectively towards our goal. The logo below demonstrates our project idea: having non-pathogenic Lactobacillus (left) ‘working’ against virulent S. aureus (right):
Let’s now enjoy our Wiki page and see how health and medical issues might be better addressed by synthetic biology!
