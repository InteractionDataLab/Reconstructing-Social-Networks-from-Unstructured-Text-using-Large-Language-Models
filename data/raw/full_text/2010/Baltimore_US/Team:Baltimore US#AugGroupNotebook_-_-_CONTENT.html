Notes from Robert Buck: 
Today, we have re-run the gel on the two fragments of the modified TAQ part, and the results show the 
experiment to be ready to move on.  We have the modified pieces and have started running a gel to purify the 
products before PCRing them together.  I am uploading a picture of the gel re-run (which needed re-running 
due to some bad buffer the last time.)  The first two lanes are 1kb and 100 bp ladder, the third is prefixed TAQ, 
and the fourth is suffixed TAQ.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="August_30"> August 30 </SPAN></H3><P>@ Burkett Lab 
WOOHOO!!! Once more into the fray...
</P><P>It was a great meeting. The enthusiasm of fall semester starting filled the halls of the school, and created a warm environment to reconnect with the group after a month's downtime in a land of transport troubles.
</P><P>Progress is continuing to be made on PoliColi. Some buffer problems have been addressed, and we're hoping to have successful results showing within the next week or so. We still need to ligate the ignition and then we'll need to put the whole thing into the C3 plasmid, and test it. We have had a NY iGEM team volunteer to test, but we'll need to test compared to commercial product, and folks within DIY-Bio have offered to test as well. We'll also need to show our purification protocols and write up our characterizations.
</P><P>Some work on the wiki is needed. We still need pictures uploaded, and even taken of the participants. Please update days with your journal entries of what has occurred and your reflections in regards to troubleshooting so we can show a path to those without these experiences. The simplistic modeling flowcharts need to be constructed for the various parts as well.
</P><P>More supplies were identified and acquired for the TraJ focus experiments being conducted at the Towson laboratory, where Liz, Lisa, Patrick and Duke will be toiling away in between classes.
</P><P>Tom also discussed the ideas of working with the local high school teachers, forensic academy and DIY-Bio contingent to make up some of the kits, Miles has been working on in connection with some small experiments. Patrick and I have proposed an smaller dry run for the DIYFest coming up in October. We'll need input from Miles to see if this might be doable, in conjunction with the Harford Hackerspace contingent. 
Ryan, Tom and Bernadette discussed the BioSafety Review Board and the questions iGEM has presented us with in this self-audit. Ryan also brought up his recent enrollment in ABSA and invitation to this years conference in Denver at the tail of September, suggesting it may be a perfect opportunity to show our level of commitment to proceeding cautiously and in good measure. He also reminded folks of the Public Presidential Summit on BioEthics in two weeks on the 13th &amp; 14th in Philadelphia, to see if anyone might be interested in going. 
We're awaiting permission from CCBC and TU public affairs officials still to find out whether we're clear to have the documentary folks from Germany here at the end of October that will be following us in our last few weeks up to the jamboree at MIT. Another intriguing development in media exposure. 
We will continue to schedule Strategy Nights from 8-10 on Mondays at the CCBC lab (room d206) and will have workbench hours in the lab on Mondays from 12 - 5pm, as well as Tuesdays from 1 - 5pm, for those of you whom might be able to join us to work on your technique and get some of this out of the way. With this in mind, we need to keep our workflow in mind to make certain our projects will be at state that can be put away for a few days when we walk out on tuesday afternoon, since Tom's schedule is booked up with active classes throughout the week. We need to keep this in mind in regards to the equipment and supplies we're using as well, since the novices will be playing on off-hours. 
This has been your BioMore Update on your Baltimore - US iGEM 2010 team....

New dNTPs and Primers for PCR received and aliquots made of each. 
PCR optimization can be started back up once again, now that uncontaminated 
materials are available again.  Testing the necessity of a 2:00 minute denature time 
at the start of the PCR program, as well as testing three parts  
(J23056, J23031 &amp; J23008) for DNA after boiling mini-prep from a few days ago. </P><P>For the PCR, I am using concentrations of .5 uM for primers and 200 uM for dNTPs, 
a 1:1000 dilution of the three parts for boiling prep DNA, and for the other
