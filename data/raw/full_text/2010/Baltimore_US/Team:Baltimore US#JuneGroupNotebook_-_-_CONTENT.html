Evening: Gary, Liz, Tom, Patrick, Duke, Ryan 
During the day-shift Robert continued to work on the PCR optimization, with the second set of Gels showing a continued contamination of one of the main components, pointing possibly to the template mixing into the dNTP's. Patrick helped Tom with some Thermophilic cultures, and Ryan completed the Plasmid Transformations of T3, K3, &amp; C3 along with the Batch prep of the CAT8 plasmids.
We caught tonight's attendees up to speed as to where the group stands on it's individual projects. Then together we discussed in detail how to break up the foundational work-flow and what steps need to be accomplished to make them happen.
Patrick detailed some of the foundational work previously performed by the earlier iGEM teams on Artificial Neural Networks.

After a roughly a week's break from official activities the team met to discuss
strategies and tactics. 
A few hands have been taking up the lab tech training from Tom and Duke throughout the lazy summer days, while doing so they revisited the basic procedural steps of ligation, gel-phoresis, transformation, as well as the tasks
of mixing and pouring media, basic chemical preparation, as well as safety and hygeine in the lab. Tom has also been introducing us to the concepts behind workflow and how to divide and stage the various processes towards a greater project concept. 
Miles suggested that he will be working towards several ideas in hardware project construction from a PCR unit to a DNA synthesizer. We discussed in depth Patrick's idea for the creation of a cellular automaton. He broke down the
previous tactics in DNA computing where everything is synthesized then re-sequenced for the answer, then posited the creation of an Artificial Neural Network type approach in utilizing various signaling proteins to reach consensus
and establishing some way to create back propagation of error. 
We've decided to restrict lab nights to Monday and Tuesday from 7-10pm, with a floater strategy meeting on Thursday nights so we can stimulate thought with a change of environment. With that in mind we are back tonight and look forward to
seeing those of you who can make it in to keep cranking on our technique.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="June_16th.2C_2010"> June 16th, 2010 </SPAN></H3><P>In attendance: Lisa, Ryan, Tom, Colin (for a short time), Duke (for a moment)

Tom says results seemed to have worked for all of the transformations this time. Some better then others. 
Steve asks the question.. &quot;Why did transformation work better this time?&quot; 
Tom discusses differences in attempts. 
Plasmid contains part a, another contains part b, another part c is simply a linear piece of DNA representing a Tet resistant backbone with the EcoRi and PstI restriction sites. 
We cut Part A with EcoR1 and Xba1. 
We cut Part B with Spe1 and Pst1. 
We cut the Linear Backbone Part C wit EcoR1 and Pst1. 
Then we combined everything into one tube using 2 ul of each part into 1 tube, and added t4 DNA ligase, hoping to get a Part A joined to Part B, because the Spe1 combines with the Xba1. And the Part A would join Part C with the EcoR1 and the Part B with Part C at the Pst1 site. 
(See photo of board - ) 
Last week, we got nothing, so why? 
Where could things go wrong? 
They could go wrong at the restriction digestion reaction (less likely as process is fairly robust, and had been tested the day previously.)
Ligation reaction may not have worked.. (again less likely, process is fairly robust). If the buffer isn't mixed well it may separate. 
How do we test? we could perform pcr to see if the ligation took place, using primers to amplify the ligated segment checking with gel electrophoreis to identify. </P><P>Transformation reaction - (Except we ran positive controls successfully) 
Still possible to have mixed up the media, since positive used Amp instead.. 
Tom checked the media and found that wasn't the case. 
Amount of Plasmid may not have been accurate. (The only thing we didn't physically check ahead of time.) 
Pure operator/Pipetting action - such as the 30 second heating followed by
kill cycle. </P><P>

50 nanograms 
(50 x 10-9) / 2,340,000 = 2.1 x 10-14 moles 
Transformation rxn is 1 x 10 (-8/-9), still fairly efficient.
We did 2 things last night, we did the transformations into the stocks.. 
By using assembly strategies that don't use the same resistance as the parts, we can more efficiently screen out non-transformed pieces. </P><P>Previously in Genetic Engineering all parts and pieces had variorus resistances where as bb tries to create a standard. </P><P>Cells can be lost in replication due to metabolic costs, and new generations lacking the Costly programming tend to outgrow the special cells. </P><P>When designing the assembly strategy try to use a plasmid backbone with a different resistance to allow the filtration/screening of parts that didn't transform correctly.</P><P>Gel-Electrophoresis Prep Review for tonights run. </P><P>Agarose 2Â % for smaller parts will create a more viscous environment.

When reviewing the tubes from last evening left in PCR there was difficulty in identifying the tubes that were done by each individual. We spent a little time using the process of elimination. Knowing Patrick, Steve, Miles, Ryans and Gary's without issue, we had to guesstimate which was Roberts, and which was David's. The reason we needed differentiation was to create a loading template, in one of the two different agarose preparations. </P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="June_14.2C_2010"> June 14, 2010 </SPAN></H3><P>In Attendance: Tom, Duke, Patrick, Robert, Steve, Gary, David, Ryan, Miles

1. Template

4. Polymerase (limiting by heatcycle) Using Taq which tends to transcribe more errors. 
5. Buffer (mg++) (limiting) </P><P>Primers are 18-30 bp long. Have to be at least 15 bp long. Primers bind to template DNA, one primer for each (5'/3' strands).
Review: What is a base..? Sugar with A, C, T or G is a nucleotide. BP are the matching set of 5' and 3' hydrogen bonded nucleotides.
</P><P>Polymerase links free dNTP's to the opened strand edges of basepairs. 
Denaturation 95 - 98 degrees c... DNA Melts 
Anealing 40 - 65 degrees c... Primer Binds 
Extension 72 degrees c... Strands Extend 
30 second cycles... </P><P>As the DNA heats it denatures then as it cools the primers anneal and polymerization takes place creating twice as many strands. The strands are held together only by hydrogen bonds, making it very easy to melt and reform. The polymerase acts like a little machine stitching the free dNTP's into the template.
</P><P>BioBrick plasmids have bb prefix and suffix. Primer binding sites vf2, vr.
Theoretically any area can become a primer site.
</P><P>With PCR we can identify and amplify particular strands/compositions. You have to know how much of the requirements to use.
Gary asked if Tom could show us where to find the optimized volume information at, and he agreed to pull out the research to show how to optimize.
</P><P>With PCR you can also design primers and introduce mutations. If primers are too short they can bind to the wrong spot.
Actual reactions may vary based on bp length and combination. Usually they are tweaked for the optimal over a series of trials.

</P><P>Tonight we tested the hypothesis that the plasmid did not code for the antibiotic resistance/that we did not use enough DNA.  A Restriction Digest reaction was set up on the ligation reactions completed on June 7.  The reactions were cut with EcoR1 and Pst1.  The reactions were allowed to incubate at 37 degrees C for one and a half hours.  The digests were then ran on a electrophoresis gel.  No DNA was present as there was not enough DNA, thus proving Duke's hypothesis.

</P><P>Is the media okay, is the antibiotic right. Positive tells you whether the cells themselves were capable of taking up our DNA. (Ideally, they should use the same antibiotic resistance, as our parts.
</P><P>Negative groups tells us whether the antibiotic and media was effective and that the cells were not resistant to the media.
</P><P>We know that cells were competent they were able to be transformed, and the antibiotic was effective. So the remaining question is whether they were able to be transformed.
</P><P>The ligation's are in question. Generally the restrictions and ligation's go smoothly.

Robert cut parts &lt;bbpart&gt;BBa_R0062&lt;/bbpart&gt; and &lt;bbpart&gt;BBa_I13507&lt;/bbpart&gt;, and the plasmid backbone &lt;bbpart&gt;pSBIT3&lt;/bbpart&gt;. 
Collin/Miles cut parts &lt;bbpart&gt;BBa_F2620&lt;/bbpart&gt;, &lt;bbpart&gt;BBa_I13507&lt;/bbpart&gt; and the plasmid backbone &lt;bbpart&gt;pSBIC3&lt;/bbpart&gt; (labeled w/green marker). 
The next step is to ligate them.
</P><P>After which we had a round table discussion about what kind of projects we may follow up with and the process of using the NCBI databases to discover pre-existing sequence information related to our various ideas.
One idea we have discussed was the option of creating a smoother introductory curve for fellow DIY-Bio commmunity members and the creation of home-brewed enzymes that might be to pricey for the amateur scientists.
We ended the night with the beginning of the various ligation reactions, as seen above.
