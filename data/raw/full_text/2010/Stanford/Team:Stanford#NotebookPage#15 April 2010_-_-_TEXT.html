DNA-ligand binding
d[DNA-L]/dt = k_on*[DNA][L] - k_off*[DNA-L]
If we define: [TotalDNA] = [DNA] + [DNA-L]
Then: d[DNA-L]/dt = k_on*([TotalDNA] - [DNA-L]) - k_off*[DNA-L]
Solving, we get: [DNA-L] = [TotalDNA][L] / (k_off/k_on + L)
Usually, we define the dissociation constant to be: kD = k_off/k_on
So we end up with: [DNA-L] = [TotalDNA][L] / (kD + L)
Other oscillators
Repressilator
Did not end up working too well in the long run, but ground-breaking for its time.
