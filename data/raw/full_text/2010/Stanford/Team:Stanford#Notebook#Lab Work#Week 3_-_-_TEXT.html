Christopher's Notebook
Run Gel of Restricted Digested RBS+GFP+Terminators (I746908 partial)
Gel Extract
Run Gel of Gel Extracted Digest Products from Friday:
3C5     E/P 2738 bp (buffer 3) F2620   E/S (on pSB1A2) 1061 bp
I746908 E/P (on psb1A2) 2093 bp-can’t separate
B0034 X/P (on psb1A2)  12 bp-do NOT run on gel
J23100 E/S (on psb1A2) 35 bp-do NOT run on gel
Karina's Notebook
Goal: We couldn't extract the terminators because they were too small and ran off the gel. After discussing with Laura and Francisco, we decided to clone GFP and RFP into the plasmid in which the terminators come (pSB1AK3).
Make BSA
BSA comes as 100x
made 1 mL of 1x solution by adding 900uL H20 and 100 uL BSA
Cut the GFP and RFP linearized plasmid (prev. cut at S and P) at EcoRI restriction site
used recipe as described on July 9, 2010
only used 1 enzyme, therefore used 27 uL H20
put in waterbath at 10:30 am, and plan to take out after lunch.
Results of diagnostic gel
left to right: 1 kb ladder, GFP plasmid (cut at S, P),  RFP plasmid (cut at S, P), GFP plasmid (cut at S, P, and cut again at E), RFP plasmid (cut at S, P, and cut again at E) Note: GFP lanes have no visible bands
Observations/Troubleshooting:
no DNA bands for GFP
not enough DNA?
will double DNA concentration during digests
bands are too large to be RFP
possible partial digest?
leave digests overnight
Digests
Digest miniprepped GFP, RFP and Terminators.
Cut GFP and RFP at E and S
Cut terminators at E and X
Recipe
25 uL DNA
1.0 uL enzyme 1
1.0 uL enzyme 2
5.0 uL NEB Buffer 2
5.0 uL BSA (10x)
13 uL H20
Total Volume: 50 uL
We used twice as much DNA than the usual protocol because our DNA concentrations from the minipreps were very low.
Prepared 3 reactions for each RSID; ran 6 PCR reactions total.  Ran digests overnight
Francisco's Notebook
Reran the diagnostic gel (see Karina's Notebook):
left to right: 1 kb ladder, GFP and RFP  plasmid (cut at S, P), GFP and RFP plasmid (cut at S, P, and also at E)  Note: GFP lanes now have (faintly) visible bands
Lessons learned:
When loading small volumes, use narrow wells.
When suspecting there are no bands, increase the exposure time to confirm.
Greg's Notebook
Ran gel with pSB3c5, F2620, I746908
I746908 didn't work, extracted pSB3c5 and F2620
Worked on MDV powerpoint presentation
Ran diagnostic gel of gel extraction results
pSB3c5 worked, F2620 left only a faint line
With Alex, miniprepped pSB1k3, I746908, I0500

Streak bacteria
Back inoculate bacteria 500 ul
Christopher's Notebook
Run Gels (0.8%) of Restriction Digests:
1M, 2M, 2J (X/P)  F2620 (E/S)  3C5 (E/P)  I0500 (E/S)
Note: for PCR of I746908: after first  gel of PCR product, gel extract, and then do a restriction digest. After restriction digest, do a reaction cleanup; pieces are ready for ligation.
Laura's Notebook
restreaked plates from 7/1/10 (with Karina)
for each plate, pick 8 colonies and streak, starting at the center of the "pie piece," and working towards the perimeter of the plate
plate ID's:
Greg's Notebook
Made gel, ran digests from yesterday
Extracted pBAD (I0500) and pSB3c5
Practiced primer design
Inventoried my box

Laura's Notebook
plates restreaked yesterday look good- bacteria grew well, some individual colonies
helped Francisco with minipreps (Promega kit) of : terminator, GFP, RFP
Francisco set up liquid cultures yesterday afternoon
Francisco poured, ran 0.8% gel

Francisco's Notebook
We've decided to cut out GFP and RFP inserts and ligate them into a linearized terminator plasmid. GFP and RFP inserts are fairly large (~700 bp) and would be easier to gel extract than a terminator insert. The terminator we are using is B1006.
Mini-prepped GFP, RFP and terminator plasmids. Mini-prep results:

Alex's Notebook
Check plates; streak new ones; back dilute for a third time. Practice PPT for MDV
7/16 Friday
Recap Meeting Notes
No recap meeting- presented at MDV this morning.
Alex's Notebook
Due Monday morning:  Cloning scheme; check list on wiki for Christina and Drew.  Create a timeline for our own use. Deadlines as well.
Francisco's Notebook
Ran a diagnostic gel of the digestion done on Wednesday
GFP and RFP plasmids (cut at E, S); Term plasmid (cut at E, X):
left to right: 1 kb ladder, RFP (cut at E, S), GFP (cut at E, S), Term (cut at E, X). Notes: Loaded every other lane, RFP lane has extremely faint band (but not visible in this image). Ran at 95V for 45 min.
Results: the terminator backbone has a bright band, but the gel extracted GFP and RFP inserts had very faint bands (low concentrations). When we ligate, we may need to use larger volumes of the inserts.
