Goals For the Week
Chris & Alex
need to make 50x TAE
complete plasmids as far can get w/o kinase and phosphotase
order DNA sometime this week
Francisco & Karina
Run orginal and new designs by Christina
design standard sRNA designs and place order by the end of the week
2:00 Meeting with Christina (Karina, Francisco, Laura)
to test: sRNA complementary to ID-RBS-scar; another sRNA centered across RBS as control (to see if shifting will affect efficiency of sRNA)
To Do:
check registry for shorter pBAD promoters? PCR own modified version?
finalize ID's
RNA folding: avoid local strong structures, > -10kcal/mol good: look at free energies of individual hairpins
BLAST to make sure not in E. Coli genome
Alex's Notebook
Restriction Digests:
Take the part out completely, and/or take out either prefix or suffix.
KEEP SOME DNA FOR GEL CONTROL!!!

7/8 Thursday
Alex's Notebook
Prepared a bunch of restriction digests. Realized some parts are way too small to follow normal BioBrick assembly.
32, 34 (X/P), J0, J7, F2620, I0500 (E/S), 1A3, 4A5, 2K3, I8, and T9 (E/P).

Gel Extract the Fragments Running a Gel of PCR Product:
first need to PCR cleanup
then run on 1.4% agarose gel (0.7 g of agarose in 50 ml of TAE)
this is necessary because of the 800 bp size of the fragment

Today's Goal: Digest GFP, RFP, and Terminators. Will do (GFP + T) and  (RFP + T) ligations on monday.
Part #'s:
GFP: E0040 (cut at S and P)
RFP: E1010 (cut at S and P)
Term: B1006 (cut at X and P)
Recipe
12.0 uL DNA
1.0 uL each enzyme
5.0 uL NEB buffer 2
5 uL BSA (10x)
Sterile H20 to fill up to 50 uL
Mix and put 37º waterbath for 2 or more hours.
Making Gel
To make 50 mL of  0.8% agarose gel, add:
.4 g agarose
50 mL TAE (1x)
10 uL EtBr
Loading the Gel
add 10 uL loading dye (6x) to digests
add 40 uL of dye + digests to wells
don't forget to include wells with controls! (uncut plasmids)
load 10 uL ladder
run at 95 V for about an hour
!!note sizes of plasmids/inserts
GFP plasmid (pSB1A2) --> 2079 bp
GFP insert --> 720 bp
RFP plasmid (pSB2K3) --> 4425 bp
RFP insert --> 681 bp
Terminator plasmid (pSB1AK3) --> 3189 bp Terminator insert --> 39 bp
Gel Results
left to  right: 1kb ladder, GFP ctrl, GFP digested, Term ctrl, Term digested, RFP ctrl, RFP digested
All bands look fine except for, there were no bands for the terminators. They were so small they ran off the gel. We are considering using PCR purification to isolate these parts.
Gel Extraction
Follow QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit Protocol , skip isopropanol step and elute in 50 uL H20.
