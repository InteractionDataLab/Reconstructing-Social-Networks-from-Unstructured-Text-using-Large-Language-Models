Laura's Notebook
helped Francisco aliquot competent cells (thaw main tube- 1 mL- on ice, transfer 50 uL to each of 20 pre-chilled 0.5 mL microfuge tubes)
7/27 Tuesday
Alex's Notebook
Continue w/ PCR.  100 seems okay. Nothing from 107, since sequence is messed up. I5 and F26 look ok.  I0500 (1255 bp)  Good  F2620 (1106 bp)  Good enough.
J100 (98 vs 62 bp) Good enough.  J107 (98 bp)  Nothing.
AfsS C (123 bp)  Good    AfsS NC (104 bp) Good
 Next steps:  PCR purify (regular and MinElute). Nanodrop.  RD: E/P. Spacer should be enough.  Heat inactivate (80 C for 20 min, 75 C for 20 min for Klenow), RD cleanup. Nanodrop.  Ligate. Ratios: 20 uL total: 1 uL ligase, 2 uL buffer, 8 uL, 8 uL insert, 375 ng vector.  Heat inactivate (65 C for 20 min.) and transform.
 New scheme for AfsS assembly:  1+2, 3+4, gel electrophoresis to get rid of primers. Use -------------- for primer concentration.  Gel extract wanted product. Mix in a single reaction. Use same as above.
Check plates.  Some grew. Culture O/N and do colony PCR.   Focus on parts needed.  RD today. All parts. Get extra RD enzyme (BglI). Control: 1A2 @ EcoRI, and use blunting enzyme from Ryan.  100 uL total: 24 uL DNA, 52 uL H2O, 10 uL BSA, 10 uL NEB buffer (check which to use), 4 uL enzymes.  Gel electrophoresis and extract.  Ligate and heat inactivate (as above). Transform.  Use brown stripe or use new ligase buffer. NEED MORE LIGASE!!!  1.5 uL DNA, incubate on ice.
Prepare more electro-competent cells.   Use DH5 alpha 21. Check for space in the incubator.

Goal: We want to try BioBrick 3A Free Assembly! Protocol found here.
Miniprep DNA
Helped Chris miniprep plasmids that contain ccdb to use for 3A assembly. Used Wizard Plus Protocol (note: Procedure takes the whole morning!)
Forgot to concentrate cells at resuspension stage (crap) so concentrated them at centrifuagtion stage. Akin to the way I do so for PCR cleanup.

Miniprepped (ProMega kit): RFP, GFP, B1006 terminator, F2620 (pBAD didn't grow)
all 18 mL (2- 9mL cultures) combined into one miniprep for each
Francisco did nanodrop: he has concentration data
set up digestions for both types of ligations (two-part and 3a protocol)
RFP and GFP: cut with EcoRI, SpeI (2 digestions each)
B1006 terminator: cut with EcoRI 2 hours, heat kill 80oC 20 minutes, then add XbaI overnight
B1006: cut with XbaI and SpeI
4C5 backbone: cut with EcoRI, PstI
for two part ligations: use GFP or RFP from #1, terminator from #2 (2 ligations- one for GFP, one for RFP)
for 3a ligation: use GFP or RFP from #1, terminator from #3, 4C5 backbone from #4 (2 ligations- one for GFP, one for RFP)
Meeting with Rayka- suggestions for Friday's (tomorrow's) meeting:
include a brief review/overview of project for clarification
basic schematics of the two sides of the project
details of each, including the devices we plan to build
ligation schemes in visuals
for digital, analog: 1. overall plan  2. ligation scheme (home slide)  3. troubleshooting/challenges (including potential solutions)
suggestion for ligations: add ATP (is most likely to go bad in buffer) include plans for next week: minimum and ideal agenda again after lab stuff Twitter slide: change title to Gold Medal Requirements (add Facebook?) Lab Logistics: suggestions to collaborate in lab more efficiently

Friday Lab Meeting:
Troubleshooting
Ligations not working
Put in enough DNA in mass
AT LEAST 200 ng, if below 200 ng, its not worth doing a ligation reaction
cells may not be electrocompetent enough
spike ATP to ligation buffer?
1 uL of 1mM ATO for 10 uL ligation reaction
sRNA_C PCR assembly
retrace what we ordered and check concentration of primers (may not be enough)
Flow Cytometry Info
Introductory training sessions take a couple of months (eek!)
can't get access everyday of the week, so don't depend on it
Scanford machine: an older maching that only reads GFP, less popular, could probably get access to this one more easily!
Kathy Crumpton: technician we need to talk to, need to check that the Scanford can read E. coli
Laura's Notebook
9am iGEM meeting
in attendance: team (Chris, Karina, Alex, Francisco, Laura), Christina, Ryan, Rayka, Anusuya, Graham
Things to accomplish/address by next week:
potential names of circuits (Laura, Rayka)
flow cytometry: Does Scanford work for E. Coli? (Chris, Graham)
get ligations to work! (everyone)
make sure DNA concentration is high enough
when looking at gel to estimate concentration, look directly at gel (not at image on computer screen)
use fresh ligase buffer (or add ATP)
get successful ligation to use as positive control (from Ryan?)
get RSID1C PCR working
check concentration of primers: mix well, make new working stock
double check annealing temperatures, correct sequences
4 piece PCR (Alex)- order as 2 pieces?
circuit diagrams, including levels of abstraction, consistent formats
Twitter:
list/group
record audio (in as many languages as possible)

Francisco's Notebook
GFP, RFP - terminator ligations:
Miniprepped GFP, RFP and Term B1006
Used Promega miniprep kit. Eluted with 50 mL water (?) for each of the 2 microfuge tube. Combined volumes into one tube.
! Tip: if planning on making freezer stocks, save some liquid culture before miniprep.
! Tip: use one microfuge tube per glass tube. Decant culture into microfuge tube, spin down, decant supernatant, and repeat. This gets all the cells into one pellet in one microfuge tube and saves tubes.
! Tip: vortex before lysing cells to thoroughly resuspend cells. Do not vortex after lysing, but invert tube with some force to mix.
Miniprep Gel Diagnostic
Used unknown percent gel, 95V, ~30 minutes. DNA concentration estimates from bands:
GFP: ~ 50 ng/uL
RFP: ~75-100 ng/uL
Term: ~50 ng/uL
! Tip: Set up two 15-well combs in a diagnostic gel, run the lower lanes first and then the upper lanes to get the most out of a gel.
Digestions of GFP, RFP and Term
Based on the estimated, and a target of 2 mg of DNA in a digestion, we set up these digestion recipes:
Term: 34 uL DNA, 5 uL NEBuffer 4, 5 uL 10x BSA, 3 uL EcoRI, 3 uL XbaI*
GFP: 34 uL DNA, 5 uL NEBuffer 4, 5 uL 10x BSA, 3 uL EcoRI, 3 uL SpeI*
RFP: 25 uL DNA, 9 uL water, 5 uL NEBuffer 4, 5 uL 10x BSA, 3 uL EcoRI, 3 uL SpeI*
Do digestions sequentially, add first enzyme, heat inactivate, take 1 uL sample for diagnostic gel later, and add second enzyme.
First enzyme added 1pm, heat inactivated 9:15pm
Second enzyme ran overnight.
Freezer Stock of GFP, RFP, Term B1006
Back dilute 350 uL of liquid culture into 5 mL of LB and incubate in shaker for around 4 hours (until cells are in late exponential phase).
Add 0.5 mL of glycerol and 1.5 mL of culture to a cryovial, invert a bunch of times, and store in the -80 deg C freezer.
Use sterile technique throughout.
Promoter - RSID, sRNA ligations
Miniprep Gel Diagnostic of pLux (F2620)
Miniprepped by Laura earlier
estimated pLux concentration: 50 ng/uL
Karina's Notebook
Make Freezer Stock from innoculations
The technique is called "Back dilution"
Get new test tubes for liquid culture
add 5 mL media + 5 mL cell sample
put back in shaker, leave for a few hours
Miniprep
Use 2 tubes for each cell tube
to concentrate the 2 tubes, add sample to microcentrifuge tubes, spin, dump out supernatant and add more sample
before resuspension spin, asparate any extra media in tubes. The extra media can mess up digestions.
When resuspending, vortex cells to make sure that the pellet is in solution
When adding buffers, work quickly and invert with force
Sunday August 1
Francisco's Notebook
GFP, RFP - terminator ligations Digestion Diagnostic Gel
0.8% w/v agarose gel
Bands for terminator, RFP, and GFP look good. First digestion of GFP (EcoRI) was slightly incomplete.
Estimated digested DNA concentrations:
RFP/GFP: 30-40 ng/uL
Term: ~30 ng/uL
! Tip: If taking samples from water bath, quickspin to get condensation down. If taking samples from the freezer, thaw, flick to mix, and quickspin to get all liquid down. ! Tip: Scrunch kimwipe to stopper gel flask. ! Tip: < 1 min microwave time should be sufficient. ! Tip: When loading, set up 4 uL beads of water on parafilm first, then add 1 uL dye, then add sample -- minimizes pipette tips used.
! Tip: For gels of digestions, run uncut, singly cut and doubly cut next to each other.
