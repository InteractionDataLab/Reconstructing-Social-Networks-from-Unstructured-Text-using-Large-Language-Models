General Meeting Notes
Wiki stuff
Everyone should sign up on 2010.igem.org website
Take advantage of the new calendar system
Need to transfer current website over
Current wiki needs a new vision
Francisco + Alex assembling wiki committee
Transform the first wave of cells
Pick colonies
Colony PCR
Sequence parts to validate
Use the Smolke sequencing network
Characterize promoters
Digest, ligate
Need to acquire enzymes
Need an PO account.
Email Jeanne
Get competent cells
Getting DNA
Assembly PCR
PCR from host cells
Synthesize de novo
RNA team
Use RNAstructure
Maybe use ViennaRNA or dinamelt
Talk to Arkin and Berkeley Postdocs
Finalize sRNA library
9kb plasmid
Meeting scheudle
Monday morning is good for logistics
Group meetings for presentations
One person presents their work in the context of everything else
Journal club

Transformations using DH5alpha cells from Graham (also have TOP10)
Protocol:
1) Take out competent E.coli cells from –80 C freezer.
2) Turn on water bath to 42 C.
3) Put 50 ul of competent cells in a 1.5 ml tube (Eppendorf or similar).
4) KEEP EVERYTHING ON ICE UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED.
5) Add 50 ng or 2.5/5 ul of circular DNA into E.coli cells. DO NOT PIPETTE UP OR DOWN; STIR INSTEAD! Incubate on ice for 15/30 min.
6) Put tube(s) with DNA and E.coli into water bath at 42 C for 20 seconds.
7) Put tubes back on ice for 15 minutes to reduce damage to the E.coli cells.
8) Add 1 ml of SOC. Incubate tubes for 1/2 hour(s) at 37 C.
9) Spread about 100/200 ul of the resulting culture on LB plates (with the appropriate antibiotic added – usually Ampicillin or Kanamycin). Grow overnight.
10) Pick the colonies about 12-16 hours later.

LB agar plates
Recipe (per 500 ml bottle):
5 g  Bacto-Peptone
2.5 g  Yeast Extract
2.5 g  NaCl
6 g Agar
From recipe, measure bacto-peptone, yeast, NaCl, and agar into each bottle. Add 450ml of water from the millipore filter in the washroom and add a stir bar. Mix on the stirplate. Remove stirbar with stirbar retriever and pour most of the mixture into a graduated cylinder. As you get to the bottom of the bottle, swirl the mixture and pour. Bring up to final volume of 500ml and pour back into the original bottle. Swirl and pour as you transfer to make sure as much of the mixture is returned to the bottle.
Adhere autoclave tape. Loosely cap bottle and set in autoclave tray with 2 inches of water. Just prior to closing the door, give each bottle another swirl to ensure mixture has not settled out.
Autoclave on Liquid 60.
Individually remove each bottle and gently swirl contents. Let cool until it can be held in your hand for a minute, add antibiotics, and pour into plates.

Laura's Notebook
made LB agar (with Alex and Chris)
made 1 500 mL bottle, 3 250 mL bottles, then autoclaved
6/30 Wednesday
Laura's Notebook
Re-try failed transformation (failed 2X for Alex and Chris)
Protocol followed:
get competent cells from -80oC freezer
set H2O bath to 42oC (already done)
add 50 uL cells to a 1.5 mL tube (keep tubes on ice)
add 50 ng or 2.5 uL circular DNA to E. Coli (variation: used 5.0 uL I0500 this time)
on ice 30 min
24oC H2O bath 20 sec.
on ice 15 min
add 1 mL SOC, 2 hours at 37oC (rotating)
plate100uL on appropriate plate (kanamycin this time), incubate 12-16 hours before picking colonies
variations: 200 uL plated this time, also plated on kan/X-gal/IPTG plate (plasmid inducible copy # by X-gal)
7/1 Thursday

helped Karina, Francisco with the transformations of parts
Francisco's Notebook
Learned how to transform using electroporation .
7/2 Friday
Recap Meeting Notes
Things to think about:
name of the device (see if electronic analogue exists)
decouple the small RNA binding from the target gene ("RSID" tags)
leadership structure for the team (weekly leader order on Google Calendar)
analog sensor- redundancy at device level or component level?
July 16: presentation to MDV- potential donor of $
