General Ideas
One Idea to measure [B] / [A] (assume [A] ≠ 0)
input A induces expression of GFP mRNA
input B induces expression of GFP sRNA (sRNA that targets the GFP mRNA transcript)
so for a given [A],
if [B] = 0, we should see glowing bacteria
if 0 < [B] < [A], we should see some glow
if [B] > [A], we should see no glow
Another Idea to measure [B] / [A] (assume [A] ≠ 0)
input A induces expression of GFP mRNA and YFP sRNA
input B induces expression of YFP mRNA and GFP sRNA
so for a given [A],
if [B] = 0, we should see GREEN glowing bacteria
if 0 < [B] < [A], we should see some glow that is more GREEN than YELLOW.
if [B] > [A], we should see some glow that is more YELLOW than GREEN.
References
here's a good reference: Engineering RNA-based circuits . It discusses different methods of regulation by RNA:
via base-pairing (small RNA)
shape-based (riboswitches)
catalytic (ribozymes)
engineered riboregulators (possible mechanism for us) Engineered riboregulators enable post-transcriptional control of gene expression
Note: apparently does not work well in practice
engineering those aforementioned sRNA's:
vague article Engineers meet small RNA
some specifics Quantitative Characteristics of Gene Regulation by Small RNA
