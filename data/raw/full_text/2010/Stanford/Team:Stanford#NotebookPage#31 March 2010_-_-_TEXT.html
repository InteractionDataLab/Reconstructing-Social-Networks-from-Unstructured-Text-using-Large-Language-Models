2. Personal Likes and Dislike and why
3. Using these presentations, how should we go about developing a project?
Consider other projects not listed above
Meeting Notes
'09 Cambridge:
Good Modeling and use of design tools
Great applicability and utility
Too many graphs resulted in distraction?
Good characterization
User-friendly color scheme
Good use of abstraction
Possible: unequal allocation of work
Noticeable systems out of parts
'09 ArtScience Bangalore:
Original idea from homeland
Sense of purpose?
Presentation seemed out of order
Succinct and clear presentation
Lack of data in comparison to other teams
Community Outreach (gold medal-related work)
'06 MIT:
Very interactive presentation
Good level of abstraction
Good decomposition
Technically advanced the field
Good diagrams
Physically proved their success (via samples)
Scent/fragrance applications are inexpensive
Synthetic biology can be fun
Needed a more contextual basis
Question posed by Prof. Smolke: Did they meet their goal?  Easily-defined milestones
'08 Caltech:
Equal allocation of work
Breadth and depth of project
Spent the right amount of time on hard data/graphs
2 types from 1 common precursor
Good idea of random differentiaton
Presenter exchange
Perhaps a better citation system for literary sources?
Was this project too risky or ambitious?  What is ambitious or simple?
Did the division of labor work well?
Take home messages:
Good characterization/analysis and modeling
High quality parts
Decomposition of project into milestones - easy to define successes or goals
Have some context or application area (before/after?)
Have an engaging presentation that involves audience involvement
Have an engaging or provocative project idea that engages the five senses?
Consider best work allocation and team knowledge
Project should advance field and provide foundational advances of some sort
Project should be communicated on various levels of abstraction (via diagrams)
Project should allow team members to have fun
