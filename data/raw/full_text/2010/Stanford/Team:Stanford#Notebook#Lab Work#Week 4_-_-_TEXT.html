Karina's Notebook
Goal: Laura will ligate GFP and RFP and ligate them to terminators. We received our RSID + RBS oligos in the mail, so I will work on the PCR. I first need to make freezer stock and working stock of oligos. Won't start PCR until after lunch because we'll leave them overnight with Chris' PCR reactions.
Make Tris-HCl
Need .01 L of  10mM Tris-HCl solution. So, add 15.76 mg Tris-HCl to 10 mL H20.
Hard to weigh out 15.8 mg, so instead got to 18.3 mg.
Determined that need to add this to 11.6 mL H20
Make Freezer Stock of Oligos
Want 100 uM solution of Tris-HCl solution
Amount of Tris-HCl to add depends on  how much of the oligo's we received.

PCR Assembly
PCR Protocol calls for:
1.25 uL reverse primer
1.25 uL forward primer
DNA Template
50 uL PCR supermix
For PCR Assembly, do not need DNA template. Also, add 4 times as much of each primer for PCR assembly.
Revised Recipe
5 uL Forward Primer
5 uL Reverse Primer
40 uL PCR Supermix
we'll be using awesome PCR supermix- KEEP ON ICE
Ran PCR with Chris, left running overnight

Alex's Notebook
1. Pick an isolated colony from an LB plate and grow overnight in 3–5 ml of LB at 37C. 2. Next morning, add 0.5 ml of the culture to 25 ml of LB in a 250-ml flask and grow at 37C to an OD600 of 0.50–0.60. 3. Transfer the culture to a 50-ml Falcon tube and spin at 6,000g in prechilled rotor for 10 min at 4C. 4. Wash the cell pellet with 20 ml of ice-cold H2O then centrifuge again as above. 5. Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of H2O and transfer to a chilled 1.5-ml tube. Spin at 10,000g for 30 seconds at 4C. 6. Wash the cells again with 1 ml of ice cold H2O and centrifuge as above. 7. Repeat the above wash and spin step. 1. Resuspend the cell pellet in H2O in a final volume of 100μl and keep on ice.
Made LB. Lots of it. Check primers for MT. Make more competent cells. Digested PCR products (E/P). Ran most of the gel. Gel extract. I0500+B0034, F2620+B0034, J23107+B0034, AfsS C, and AfsS N. Ligate onto 1A2. Transform, with the old samples as well. Ran another PCR: 3,3,5,5,5.

ran diagnostic gel for PCR-assembled DNA (Karina set up PCR rxns yesterday)
order on gel:
100 bp ladder
RSID1/RBS
RSID2/RBS
Karina's Notebook
Goals: Run gel of PCR Assembly Product, gel extraction, digest, then run PCR clean up.
Make Gel
Chris made me an 0.8% agarose gel
Load Gel
added 10 uL loading dye directly into PCR tubes
loaded 40 uL of each sample into wells
Gel Results
left to right: 1kb ladder, RSID1 PCR reactions A, B and C
left to right: 1kb ladder, RSID2 PCR reactions A, B and C
Analysis/Observations
Gel looked a little streaky to me, but we really only need the brightest bands (as circled). For next time:
use 100 bp ladder (instead of 1 kb)
Don't even bother with gel extraction after running a PCR. It is highly inefficient and a lot of DNA will be lost. Instead, run a a diagnostic gel to check that PCR assembly worked but then proceed to run a PCR cleanup and then digest.
Gel with 100bp ladder:
left to right: 100bp ladder, RSID 1, RSID 2

extracted and incubated each of the samples separately. To combine, loaded 1A and 1B into one spin column and 2B and 2C into another. Loaded up to 800 uL, spun down, loaded, then spun again. Then continued to follow procedure .
PCR Assembly
Set up another PCR assembly of RSID 1 and RSID 2 so that we have samples that have not been gel extracted. Ran another three samples of each. Will let run overnight.
Primers were designed to anneal at 55º, but set up a temperature gradient to test annealing at other temperatures.

7/21 Wednesday
Alex's Notebook
Redo ligations (3,7,7,2,1). Transform. Plate. Also run control. PCR: clean up, digest (FUCK UP: CUT w/ EP???), and gel electrophoresis (check lengths of DNA), ligate, and transform. Tomorrow.  Diagnostic:  I0500 (1255 bp)  Good  F2620 (1106 bp)  Bad => primers were incorrect.  J107 (98 bp)  Not seen. Not seen again either on second try (1, 1.5, 2 ul template, working, stock).  AfsS C (123 bp)  Good  AfsS NC (104 bp) Good
Redid PCR for J107 (6): 1,1.5,2 template, w/ stock or working primers. Made more RDs:  1A2 (2079 – 1069, EP),  3C5 (2738 – 1069, EP),  T9 (1945, use BglI, 936 and 1221, EP), and (also use natural minipreped stuff, just diluted, on 1A3, to check transformation growth) F2620 (1061 – 2079, ES) (also cut at just SP, since on 1A2) E24 (876 – 2079, ES) and (also cut at just SP, since on 1A2). Mistake. Minipreped more cultures.  Use above two for ligations to avoid red shit.
Laura's Notebook
today's digestions:
RSID1, RSID2 (gel extracted from first PCR done by Karina)- digest with XbaI, PstI
run overnight; started at 11:30am
promoters within backbones (I0500-from Greg's box, and F2620-from Chris' box)- digest with SpeI, then PstI (done by Francisco)
SpeI digest run for 3 hours, then heat killed 20 min. at 80oC, then PstI added overnight (to reduce enzyme competition for sites on the DNA, since recognition sequences are very close to each other)

Karina's Notebook
Goal: Left Laura to gel extract previous PCR product as I worked on the new PCR product. Today, must make and run a diagnostic gel, PCR clean up, then digest RSID 1 and RSID 2.
Make TAE
Need a 1 L solution; we have 50x TAE stock
20 mL 50x TAE + 980 mL H20
Make Gel
Want a 2% agarose gel because oligos are short (~220 bp).
1 g agarose + 50 mL TAE
10 uL EtBr
Also, made Chris an 0.8% agarose gel (to repay him for yesterday).
Load Gel
10 uL 100 bp ladder
1 uL dye + 1 uL DNA
Results
100bp ladder, RSID1 and RSID2 PCR reactions
Great! No difference in the annealing temperatures. All bands are clear and bright, can use all three samples for restriction digests.
PCR Cleanup
Used Qiagen MinElute PCR Purification Kit Protocol.
50 uL reaction, therefore use 250 uL buffer PB
Followed protocol and eluted in 10 uL water.
Restriction Digest
Cut at X and P
Recipe
10 uL DNA
5 uL NEBuffer 2
5 uL BSA
1 uL Xba
1 uL Pst
28 uL H20
Total volume: 50 uL
Let run overnight in 37º waterbath
Francisco's Notebook
Digested  RSID+RBS's and promoter backbones
RSID1+RBS: digested with Xba1 and Pst1
RSID2+RBS: digested with Xba1 and Pst1
pBad (I0500): digested with Spe1, then heat inactivated, then digested with Pst1^
pLux (F2620): digested with Spe1, then heat inactivated, then digested with Pst1^
^The restriction enzymes were added one after the other so that they would not compete when binding to nearby stretches of DNA.
Made 100uL of 10X BSA stock from 100X BSA stock.
Laura ligated GFP and RFP inserts to terminator backbones on Monday. Ligated terminator backbones to itself (no insert added) as a control to check that the terminator backbone was cut at both E and X.
Greg's Notebook
Ran restriction digest of miniprepped DNA
Inoculated 3 tubes each with 5 mL LB and F2620, T9002, pSB3c5, pSB1a2, I0500, E0240
Gel-extracted some stuff for Alex
Did two electroporations
Chris's Notebook
Run Gel of PCR Products (sfGFP and embCAB promoter)
See if Ligations Worked
Restriction Digests of:
Psb3C5: E/P
pSB1A2: E/P
F2620: S/P
pBAD: E/S
Did two each
Ligations did not grow-possibly because they were sitting for over 5 days at room temperature.
PCR of embCAB did not work-got multiple products, ran again:
Use PCR HF SuperMix
For each reaction:
5.0 ul of forward primer
5.0 ul of reverse primer
1.0 ul of DNA template (DNA miniprepped from today)
40.0 ul of PCR HF SuperMix
Primer Dilution-initially at 100 mM, bring to 10 mM
PCR of sfGFP worked-got expected bands; approximated 1200 bp
7/22 Thursday
Alex's Notebook
Do above.  Check plates. Re-streak some.  Gel electrophoresis for miniprep restriction digest. Gel extraction and ligation. Gel electrophoresis for restriction digest of PCR stuff. Gel extraction and ligation.   PCR cleanup for J107, check with Isis/Ryan first.  Inoculated J23100, J23107, and transformed J23119.   P1, 18A, Plasmid: pSB1A2
Make:  .8% gel with 15 wells. Run green.  3% gel with 15 wells. Run blue.

Francisco's Notebook
Digested RSID's did not show up in the diagnostic gel:
left to right: 1kb ladder, digested parts: pBad, pLux, RSID1, RSID2 (latter two not so visible)
Rerun diagnostic gel for the RSID's, using high percentage gel and 100kb ladder:
left to right: 100bp ladder, RSID1_KP, RSID1_LEO, RSID2_KP, RSID2_LEO. Notes: loaded every other lane, KP lanes do not have visible bands, LEO lanes have very faint bands under high exposure
Possible problems:
Gel extraction has low yield. Plan for next time: re-run PCR of RSID's, but forgo gel extract if PCR reaction is clean.
Not enough DNA was loaded in the gel. Plan for next time: try loading more volume of DNA
We have prepared GFP-terminator and RFP-terminator ligations on Monday, and a control ligation with the terminator backbone and no insert on Wednesday. Hope to transform bacteria with those ligations soon.
Re-aliquoted 1000uL of electrompetent cells Alex prepared into 20 tubes of 50uL each. Stored in 80 deg C freezer and will start transformations on Friday.

Ran e0240 and i0500 on .8% gel. PCR RD => do MinElute and record concentration, ligate, and transform as appropriate (DH5a). Run diagnostic; determine which is which and check for brightness. Primers. Redo PCR; gradient. Sequence J23107.
Karina's Notebook
Goal: Diagnostic gel of sRNA's. PCR cleanup ad digest.
Make 2% Agarose gel
And make .8% and 3% diagnostic gel for Alex
Four our diagnostic gel, Load 10uL 100 bp ladder, 1uL dye + 1uL sample
Run at 75 V for 45 min.
Redo PCR for RSIDs
Rayka says:
Keep samples on ice until very last minute, right before you place them in PCR block
make sure to preheat the block before you place samples in
want high specificity of melting and annealing temperatures
PCR Cleanup of sRNAs

Transformed E. coli BW strain with ligations prepared earlier in the week: GFP-terminator, RFP-terminator, and terminator ligated with no insert (negative control). 0.5 uL of DNA was used for each transformation and the settings on the zapper was 2000 V, 25 uF, 200 ohms. Some of the cells sparked and had to be discarded. Incubated for almost an hour after electroporation, spun down the cells at 3000g for 3 min. Transferred cells to plates, and left the plates to incubate overnight.
Saturday morning update: None of the plates had colonies. =(
