GFP, RFP - terminator ligations
Gel Extraction of Term, RFP, GFP
Used two tubes for GFP, RFP inserts. Elution volume per tube: 40 uL. Combined tubes.
Concentrated GFP, RFP inserts in vacu-fuge. Evaporated till 20 uL left.
! Tip: Chop up gel pieces before putting in tube  ! Tip: Use heat blocks filled with water to dissolve  ! Tip: Tape combs together to get a larger well for gel extraction
Diagnostic Gel of Gel Extraction
Concentrated GFP, RFP gel extracts using Vacu-fuge, evaporated 80 uL of gel extract to 20 uL.
Loaded 3 uL of DNA sample.
Estimated concentration: GFP, RFP = 15 ng/uL
Ligation of GFP, RFP to linearized terminator
Want: 150 ng of vector, 5 to 1 molar ratio of insert to vector. Resulting recipe:
6 uL vector (terminator B1006)
11 uL insert (GFP or RFP)
2 uL ligase buffer
1 uL ligase
total: 20 uL reaction volume
start: late afternoon, went overnight.
Promoter - RSID, sRNA ligations
Inoculated pBad
Two glass tubes, each with 6 mL LB
PCR assembly of RSID, sRNA (program FLK)
95 for 2 min, 94 for 30 s, 55 for 30s, 72 for 30s, (cycle last three steps 9 more times), 72 for 10 min, 15 for ever.
Greg's Notebook
Inoculated freezer stocks of most of our parts with Alex
Began planning for promoter characterization project:
Going to do 3A ligations of the form: promoter + superfolded GFP + Kan plasmid
Process:
Digest parts with at least 2 ug DNA
PCR cleanup
Diagnostic gel (remember to save uncut DNA for control)
Ligate in PCR tubes
Heat inactivate at 65 C for 20 min
Performed first digestion (F2620 + sfGFP + pSB4k5)

Ran diagnostic gel:
sfGFP digested nicely, F2620 yielded 3 bands corresponding to insert, cut plasmid, and uncut plamid
pSB4k5 gave only one band and a smudge, so I decided to redigest with only .5 uL of each enzyme, leaving it to run overnight
Karina's Notebook

Chris's Notebook
Transformations
Used DH10B electrocompetent cells from Isis (in 20 ul aliquots)
Time constants with 1 ul of Ligation were approximately 4.5-4.6.
For J23100+sfGFP and J23100+B0034 and 4C5: arced, so re-did with 0.5 ul of Ligation and got 4.6-4.8
Let shake in incubator for 30 minutes, then spun down at 4000 g for 2 minutes; took out 800 ul of the supernatant and resuspended in the remaining 200.
Electrocompetent Cell Prep
Inoculate DH5a21 electrocompetent cells before leaving, come back tomorrow
Ligations/Restriction Digests
If plates don’t grow, try again with more DNA.
Inoculations
F2620, I0500, I746908, 4C5 w/ccdb

GFP, RFP - terminator ligations
Transformed ligations
RFP-term: time constant 4.7ms, 1787 volts
GFP-term: 4.9, 1786 volts
Incubated in SOC for 40 minutes, spun down at 5000 g for 3 minutes, removed 750 uL of supernatant, plated the remaining 250 uL.
Edit: Colonies!!!
Promoter - RSID, sRNA ligations
Miniprep pBad
Eluted two 50 uL tubes, combined into one 100 uL tube.
Spin columns had no residual liquid after elution
Diagnostic Gel 1 of RSID’s, sRNA’s and pBad
Loaded 1 uL of samples
RSID and sRNA bands were not that visible, did not have 1 kb ladder for pBad
Made 600 uL of 100 bp ladder
60 uL 100 bp ladder (want to load 0.5 ug of DNA with 10 uL of ladder)
100 uL 6x gel loading dye
440 uL water
Diagnostic Gels, run 2
For PCR products:
Loaded 5 uL samples in 0.8% gel , RSID on top tow, sRNA on bottom row
Loaded bottom row during this second run - ethidium bromide may have leaked out
RSID bands looked good, sRNA bandswere not visible (possibly due to low EtBr)
For pBad
Loaded 1 uL DNA in 2.0% gel
Band was visible and in the right place
Diagnostic Gel, run 3
Karina and Greg PCR cleaned-up the PCR products
Loaded 5 uL RSID’s and sRNA’s in 2% gel
Bands were visible and in the right place
Digestions of promoters and PCR products
pBad, pLux will be cut at S, P
34 uL DNA, 5 uL BSA, 5 uL NEBuffer 2, 3.5 uL PstI, 3.0 uL SpeI*
RSID’s, sRNA’s will be cut at X, P
34 uL DNA, 5 uL BSA, 5 uL NEBuffer 3, 3.5 uL XbaI, 3.0 uL PstI*
First enzyme added in the evening, leave overnight. Heat inactivate next morning and take 1 uL sample for subsequent diagnostic gel.
Edit: Second enzyme added the next morning, after heat inactivation.
Greg's Notebook
Ran diagnostic gel of overnight pSB4k5 digest
Still didn't work; there were 3 bands, the smallest of which was about the size of the plasmid backbone, and there was no band corresponding to the ccdB insert
Decided to re-redigest pSB4k5 using .5 uL of each enzyme for only 1 hour
After running on a diagnostic gel, discovered that this, too, failed in the same way as the previous digestions had. I decided to try other Kan plasmids
PCR'd Chris's transcription factor promoter (pTFc)

GFP, RFP - terminator ligations
Colony PCR of RFP-term and GFP-term ligations
Primers (check plasmid): VF2, VR
Picked 5 colonies to PCR, streaked them on a plate (divided into a grid)
Streaked 20+ more colonies just in case
Positive band = ~ 1000 bp, Negative band = ~ 300 bp
9 uL PCR Supermix, 0.5 uL VR, 0.5 uL VF2 (unknown concentrations)
total: 10 uL reaction volume
Tubes labelled G1 thru G5, R1 thru R5
Promoter - RSID, sRNA ligations
Digestions of promoters and PCR products
Heat inactivated the overnight digestion and added the second enzyme.
Stopped second digestion around 5 pm
Diagnostic Gels of Digestions
Ran RSID’s and sRNA’s on 2% gel, 1 uL samples
Ran pBad and pLux on 0.8% gel, 1 uL samples
All bands visible, pBad was very faint
Greg's Notebook
Performed restriction digest of pTFc, J23100, J23106, J23109, F2620, pSB2k3, pBAD*, pSB1k3
*There wasn't enough pBAD, so I used all that was left (~20uL). Even if this digest fails I still have the previously-digested stuff at a low-ish concentration

Suggestions from Christina:
diagnostic gels from yesterday's digestions (done by Francisco)
run promoters (pBAD, pLUX) on 0.8%, RSID's (1 and 2) and sRNA's (1, 2, 1C, 2C) on 2%
gel extract everything (on separate gels), depending on how complete digestions look- if PCR cleanup, SIP treat
PCR cleanup inserts (PCR assembled parts)
use MiniElute columns use 10 mM Tris instead of H2O (water here is acidic, and elution is pH-dependant)
let sit 1 minute before eluting
load 1 uL on diagnostic gel
check enzymes to see if getting low: order more if necessary
colony PCR
primers: complementary to prefix and suffix or VF and VR? (VF and VR- further from ends to allow subsequent sequencing)
expected lengths with and without insert: ladder choice, gel %, extension time
10 uL reactions, run 5 uL on gel
setting up reactions:
make, aliquot master mix (SuperMix + primers)
pick colony with innoculating needle: inoculate PCR reaction, then streak on small square or wedge on a plate (make sure plates are dry)
screen (PCR) 5 colonies to start, but streak out 10-15 extras just in case/for further screenings
if no bands on gel, could be: not enough cells, not correct plasmid
if positive results, get sequenced
Plan for Colony PCR:
primers: VR (~175bases from insertion site), VF (~140 bases from insertion site)
insert lengths: GFP ~720 bp, RFP ~ 680 bp
expected lengths on gel: without insert- 355 bp, with GFP- 1075 bp, with RFP- 1035 bp
include positive control for PCR (from Chris- PCR reaction that has worked with this PCR mix)
Set up Colony PCR reactions (with Francisco): 0.5 uL each primer (VF and VR stocks from Alex) 9 uL PCR SuperMix
enough for 11 reactions made, aliquot 10 uL to each of 10 PCR tubes
pick 5 colonies each GFP-term and RFP-term- inoculate PCR reaction, then spread on small square of Kanamycin plate
15 extra colonies of each spread on plates

Francisco's Notebook
GFP, RFP - terminator ligations
Diagnostic Gel of Colony PCR’s
Ran at 95 V for 30 minutes
G1, G2, G3, G4, G5 all had positive bands
R1, R3, R5 had positive bands, R4 had a very faint correct band, R2 had a negative band
Inoculated G1, G3, G5, R1, R3, R5
Promoter - RSID, sRNA ligations
Gel Extraction of Digested pBad and pLux
Gel run at 75V for 50 minutes
Much of the pBad sample was stuck in the well. (Genomic DNA? But diagnostic gel of miniprep DNA had the correct band, without getting stuck in the well).
Eluted in 30 uL EB (elution buffer = 10 mM Tris-CL pH 8.5)
PCR clean-up of digested PCR products (Karina)
Used MinElute, eluted in 10 mM Tris-CL after letting it stand for a minute
Used vacufuge to concentrate, 60 deg C, final volume around 15 uL
! Tip: Remember to open tube lids when using vacufuge so liquid can evaporate
Diagnostic Gel of Gel Extracts, PCR Clean-ups, and Colony PCR’s
Ran at 95 V for 30 minutes
Loaded 3 uL of RSID’s, sRNA’s and promoters
Laura's Notebook
8:45am: put Chris' liquid cultures (8) in 4oC
helped Greg with minipreps
10:00 am: meeting with Saum (IISME peer coach)
10:45 am: check in meeting with team- discussed plan for today (me: pour 2% gel, run colony PCR reactions from yesterday)
11:00 am: RET interview meeting (IISME stipend grant requirement)
did gel purification with Francisco of pBAD, pLUX (I did pLUX, he did pBAD)
2% gel for colony PCR diagnostic- 95V, 30 minutes
Francisco loaded other samples in top wells (PCR cleanup products, gel purification products from pBAD and pLUX)
order of top wells: RSID1, RSID2, sRNA1, 100 bp ladder, sRNA2, sRNA1C, sRNA2C, 100 bp ladder, pBAD, pLUX
order (lower wells):  GFP-term 1-5 (5uL of 10uL PCR rxns from yesterday + 1 uL loading dye), 100 bp ladder, 1kb ladder, RFP-term 1-5
3:35 pm: off to IISME End of Summer Celebration...
Karina's Notebook
Goal: Run PCR cleanup of RSIDs and sRNAs. Use minElute columns (Check to see if we have them). If not, run the clean up and concentrate down to 20 uL using Speed Vac. Elute in 50 uL Tris-HCl.
MinElute columns have purple "lining" of filter, NOT white, and are stored in the 4ºC.
Don't have any, so run clean up and then use Speed Vac to concentrate.
DON'T MIX UP BUFFERS.
Digestion volume: 50 uL
Let Tris-HCl stand for 1 min before spin
Dreamweaver Workshop!
Left lab from 1:00-4:30 to learn how to update the website.
Greg's Notebook
Checked inoculations from last night
Miniprepped pSB4K5 from inoculations (all were cloudy), nanodropped and got concentrations between 70 and 120 ng/uL
Ran diagnostic gel of PCR products from yesterday(Chris's transcription factor promoter)
large smudges for all of them, but distinct bands present for the newly stitched ones
PCR-cleaned those and ran again on gel
newly stitched ones now had clear band and, when nanodropped, concentrations around 100 ng/uL
template ones had very faint bands, concentrations of 24 and 29 ng/uL
Digested pSB4K5 and one of the newly stitched promoters
promoter showed nothing in the digested lane, so I ran again using 5uL of sample
Figured out how to make the wiki do columns - hurray for CSS tutorials!

GFP, RFP - terminator ligations
Miniprepped G1, G3, G5, R1, R3, R5
Colonies with successful ligations
Used Promega Kit, eluted in 50 uL of the provided nuclease-free water
No water left in column after elution
Nanodrop results:
(Colony: 260/280, 260/230, ng/uL)
G1: 1.86, 1.18, 113.8

R5: 1.88, 1.34, 133.4
! Tip: Must elute in water if sending in DNA for sequencing
Sent in G1, G3, R1, R3 for sequencing
Promoter - RSID, sRNA ligations
Ligations with pLux
Did not attempt any ligations with pBad (low concentration). Started with the pLux ligations first.
Roughly aimed for a 10:1 insert to vector molar ratio.
Split the vector (pLux) DNA evenly between the three ligations.
All ligations:  2 uL 10x T4 ligase buffer, 1 uL T4 ligase
pLux + RSID2:  8 uL vector, 2 uL insert, 7 uL water
pLux  + sRNA1: 8 uL vector, 8 uL insert, 1 uL water
pLux +  sRNA1c: 8 uL vector, 5 uL insert, 4 uL water
Transform pLux ligations
Used 0.5 uL DNA. Zapper settings: 1800 V, 25 uF, 2000 ohms.
pLux + RSID2: time constant 4.6 ms, 1786 volts
pLux + sRNA1: 4.8, 1787 volts
pLux + sRNA1c: 4.6, 1786 volts
Plated overnight.
Edit: only one colony from the pLux + sRNA 1c ligation =(
Ryan’s advice:
Reduce volume of digestions to 10 uL.
Don’t ligate if DNA concentration is less than 15-20 ng/uL, if there is less than 100-150 ng of vector in a 10 uL ligation, concentrate the DNA first.
Laura's Notebook
Worked with Francisco to plan, set up ligations- From yesterday's gel, these were my approximate concentrations (3 uL loaded each lane, so band ng divided by 3 for ng/uL):
RSID1: 100 ng/uL
RSID2: 130 ng/uL
sRNA1: 13 ng/uL
sRNA2: 17 ng/uL
sRNA1C: 23 ng/uL
sRNA2C: 23 ng/uL
pBAD: barely visible- will redo miniprep, digestion, etc. before ligating
pLUX: 20 ng/uL

Greg's Notebook
Checked gels from yesterday - still nothing for Chris's transcription factor promoter
at least pSB4K5 had a faint band in the right place. Unfortunately there was a much larger band indicating that the plasmid had only been cut once
Summary: What I Have
weakly digested pSB4K5 (with ccdB)
some PCR'd (undigested) TF promoter of dubious quality
J23100, J23106, J23109 digested
F2620 digested
sfGFP digested from I746908
pSB2K3 (no ccdB) digested
Plan:
re-PCR TF promoter using stitched stuff as templates
3A assemble J23's + sfGFP + 4K5/2K3
J23's: 35 bp
sfGFP: 800 bp
4K5: 3419 bp, 2K3: 4425 bp
