Meeting Agenda
1.  Each team member independently brainstorms 3 ideas in each category for a total of 12 ideas per person.
2. We then go through and put all the 60 ideas on the board under particular categories
3. From each of the 60 ideas, team members rapidly generate as many related project ideas as possible (i.e. ways to implement the idea, branch-off ideas, etc.)
4. Once all the ideas have been generated, students will go through and pict their favorite ideas to flesh out for next time.
Meeting Notes
300-400 ideas were generated at the meeting.  Students ended up picking the ideas that intrigued them the most (see next week's meeting)
