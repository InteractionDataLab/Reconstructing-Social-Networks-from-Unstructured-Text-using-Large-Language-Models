Discussed the possible strains of bacteria/metabolic pathways that could be made us of in an oil spill
3 Strains of naturally occurring bacteria: psuedomonas putida, alcanevorix, cycloelasticus,
Each can break down certain compoments, e.g. PAHs, Toluene, Xylene, Straight Chain alkanes
Certain problems are detailed below.
Split the problems into 4 solutions:
Distributions/Large Scale Production
Nitrogen Fixation/Phosphorus Supply
Why better than what has naturally evolved
Choke points in the metabolism
Some offshoots of the oil spill idea came into existence:
Using the straight chain splitting bacteria in place of cracking in a refinery (Alcanevorix)
