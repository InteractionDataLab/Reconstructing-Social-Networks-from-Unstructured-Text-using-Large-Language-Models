Promoter - RSID, sRNA ligations
Retransformed pLux ligations
Tried using 1 uL of DNA this time.
pLux + RSID2: time constant 4.4 ms, 1786 volts
pLux + sRNA1: 4.3 ms, 1786 volts*
pLux + sRNA1c: 4.4 ms, 1786 volts
second try. first try sparked, TC = 2.5 ms
Incubated in SOC in the rotisserie for an hour, spun down at 5000g, 3 min, took out 750 uL, plated remaining (~130 uL) overnight
edit: no colonies =( =( =(

Karina's Notebook
To 3A or not to 3A... that is the question.
Amount of DNA in ligation is key!
For 10 uL ligation, never put less than 150 ng of backbone
Running low on stock of RSIDs and sRNAs, need to make more in order to proceed with assembly.
Also need to digest pBad and pLux
Make Antibiotic Plates
Recipe (per 500 mL bottle)
5 g Bacto-Peptone
2.5 g Yeast Extract
2.5 g NaCl
6 g Agar
measure out and add to each bottle. Add 450 mL millipore H20 and shake vigorously.
Total Volume --> 500 mL
Adhere autoclave tabe, LOOSEN CAP, and set in autoclave tray
Start program (autoclave liquid)
Once program ends, use GLOVES to remove bottles and let cool. Once cool enough to keep your hand on the bottle for at least 10 s, add antibiotic.
Antibiotic Concentrations:
A 50 ug/mL
K 20 ug/mL
C 34 ug/mL
T 20 ug/mL
From a 1000x stock, add .5 mL antibiotic to 500 mL solution. Pour plates and let solidify over night.
Sequencing Analysis GFP looks good! RFP has wierd, additional bases at the very end of RFP but before suffix. It could be part of the BioBrick part, will send E1010 for sequencing tomorrow just to double check.
Greg's Notebook
Colony PCR'd successful colonies from the weekend PCR'd some more sfGFP Inoculated some more J23106, J23109 PCR-purified pTFc, it looks good Inoculated some LB-Kan with J23109 + sfGFP + pSB2k3
Chris's Notebook
Colony PCR Round Two
F2620+sfGFP+psb4C5: 1.5 ul of F2620, 1.25 ul of sfGFP, 2 ul of psb4C5, 12.25 of mq
I746908+psb4C5: 2 ul of psb4C5, 3 ul of I746908 12 of mq
-embCAB+sfGFP+psb4C5: 5 ul of pemb, 1.25 ul of sGFP, 2 ul of psb4C5, 8.75 of mq
J23100+sfGFP+psb4C5: 2 ul of psb4C5, 5 ul of j23100, 1.25 ul of sfGFP, 8.75 of mq
Used 3 colonies from each; used toothpicks to inoculate (bad idea); restreaked AGAIN
Made LB Agar plates (chloramphenicol, kanamycin)

Francisco's Notebook
Promoter - RSID, sRNA ligations
Decided to try 3A assembly.
PCR assembly of RSID’s and sRNA’s
Doubled DNA volume: 10 uL fwd piece, 10 uL rev piece, 30 uL PCR supermix
total: 50 uL reaction volume
Set up 3 reaction tubes each for RSID1, RSID2, sRNA1, sRNA2, sRNA1c, sRNA2c.
Ran FLK program (see above)
Inoculate pLux, pBad
2 tubes for each promoter, 6 mL of culture.
Laura's Notebook
set up colony PCR for single colony from pLUX-sRNA1C ligation/transformation:
9 uL supermix, 0.5 uL of each primer (VF, VR)
cycling program as before: COLPCR72
3pm meeting with Drew, Rayka about device names, parameters
Karina's Notebook
Goal: 3A Assembly
We don't have enough DNA, need to redo PCR assembly. Upscaling:
10 uL of each primer
30 uL supermix
3 reactions of each product. 10 cycle PCR.
Greg's Notebook
Miniprepped J23106, J23109 Used liquid culture of J23109 + sfGFP + pSB2K3 to seed plates Nanodropped minipreps + sfGFP form yesterday:

Inoculate E1, F2, I1, J and send for sequencing tomorrow
Made LB Agar plates (chloramphenicol, kanamycin)
PCR of embCAB, sfGFP
Gel was good; no smears/got expected bands.
PCR purification is next step
8/11 Wednesday
Francisco's Notebook
GFP, RFP - terminator ligations
Sent in miniprepped RFP (E1010) for sequencing
There was a funny sequence in the RFP-term ligations. This is to check if that sequence is part of the RFP BioBrick part.
Inoculated G1, G3, R1, R3 for freezer stock and miniprep (Karina)
Promoter - RSID, sRNA ligations
Miniprep pBad, pLux (Laura)
Eluted in 50 uL nuclease-free water
Nanodrop results: 260/280, 260/230, ng/uL
pBad: 1.93, 1.53, 112.0
pLux: 2.00, 1.67, 149.8
Diagnostic Gel of RSID’s and sRNA’s
Combined three 50 uL PCR reactions into one volume.
2% gel, 95 V, 30 minutes, 1 uL of sample each
left to right: RSID1, RSID2, sRNA1, 100 bp ladder, sRNA1c, sRNA2c
No distinct bands, smearing above expected length, nothing below expected length (so no left-over starting pieces?)
Note, this was the PCR assembly done with twice as much DNA as previous PCR’s
Retry PCR Assembly of RSID’s and sRNA’s (vary DNA amounts)
Troubleshooting PCR assembly. Used only RSID2 and sRNA1c, and tried different amounts of DNA:
A: 0.25 fwd, 0.25 rev, 9.5 PCR supermix
B: 0.50 fwd, 0.50 rev, 9.0 PCR supermix
C: 1.00 fwd, 1.00 rev, 8.0 PCR supermix
D: 2.00 fwd, 2.00 rev, 6.0 PCR supermix
(PCR tube labeling: R = RSID2, S = sRNA1c)
Diagnostic Gel of PCR Assembly (with varied DNA amounts)
Results not great, best result with ratio C (see above), but still smeary.
Retry PCR Assembly (vary annealing temperature)
Tried 50, 55 and 60 deg C
Inoculated pLux-sRNA1c ligation, possibly for sequencing (Karina)
edit: colony PCR negative, no sequencing =(
Other
Prepared working stock of 1 kb ladder
440 uL water
100 uL 6x loading dye
60 uL 1 kb ladder
total: 600 uL total volume
(Diluted so that 10 uL of working ladder contains 0.5 ug of DNA)
Laura's Notebook
miniprepped pBAD, pLUX
used Promega kit
combined 2 liquid cultures for each into 1 tube (when pelleting cells)
eluted in 50 uL H2O (from kit)
set up colony PCR (same as yesterday; tube dried up in machine)
troubleshooting PCR stitching reactions (prior to ligations)- recommendations from Christina:
each "step:" try RSID2, sRNA1C; use best result to continue to next "step"
different starting DNA concentrations: 0.25X, 0.5X, 1X, 2X
different annealing temperatures: 50oC, 55oC, 60oC
cycle numbers: 5, 10, 15, 20
Step 1: try different DNA concentrations
Francisco set up tubes and added PCR SuperMix (10 uL reactions)
I added primers to 1 series of 4, he did the other
thermal cylcler program: FLK
run on 2% gel at 90V for 30 minutes
Step 2: try different annealing temperatures
use 1 uL each primer; 8 uL PCR SuperMix in each reaction (3 + 3 + 24 in one tube, then 10 uL aliquoted to other 2 tubes)
cycling (FLK program) modified to include a gradient at the annealing step: 50oC to 62oC
row H = 50oC, row E = 54.8oC, row C = 59.6oC
Karina's Notebook
Goal: Send RFP in for sequencing, set up liquid culture of RFP + T and GFP + T to make freezer stocks tomorrow.
Sequencing
Need to send Ryan:
Name of plasmid (RFP)
size of plasmid (5106, includes plasmid and RFP insert)
Concentration (179.8 ng/uL)
primers to use (VF2)
To determine what primers to use, check plasmid map on parts registry. Plasmid mush have VF regions.
Prep 10 uL of sample in one tube and 3uMol Primer in another. Tape to sheet and place in envelope outside door to send off.
Inoculate RFP + T and GFP +T
After analyzing sequencing results, saw that G1 and R3 colonies have a single point mutation. Keep this in mind, will still inoculate but will only use G3 and R1 for further cloning.
Chris's Notebook
Colony PCR
Miniprep of E1, F2, J, I2 and sent for sequencing (10 for each forward/reverse)
Keep primers at 3 uM, 3 of 10 uM + 7 H20
Should receive results tomorrow
Plates
Greg got lawns?????

94oC
5 minutes
ramp to 55oC at 1oC per second

1 minute
72oC
15 seconds
ran 5 uL of each sample on 2% gel at 90V for 30 minutes (along with 5uL each sample from yesterday (10 cycles, different annealing temperatures)
Next step (Christina's suggestions): different numbers of cycles, extend for 15 seconds (again, only with RSID2 and sRNA1C for now) Cycling program:
