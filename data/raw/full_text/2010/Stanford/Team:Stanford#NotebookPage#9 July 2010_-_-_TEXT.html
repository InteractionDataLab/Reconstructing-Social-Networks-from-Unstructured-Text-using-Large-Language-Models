Meeting Minutes
Weekly Leader Presentation: Karina
Agenda
Karina's Notebook
Today's Goal: Digest GFP, RFP, and Terminators. Will do (GFP + T) and  (RFP + T) ligations on monday.
Part #'s:
GFP: E0040 (cut at S and P)
RFP: E1010 (cut at S and P)
Term: B1006 (cut at X and P)
Recipe
12.0 uL DNA
1.0 uL each enzyme
5.0 uL NEB buffer 2
5 uL BSA (10x)
Sterile H20 to fill up to 50 uL
Mix and put 37º waterbath for 2 or more hours.
Making Gel
To make 50 mL of  0.8% agarose gel, add:
.4 g agarose
50 mL TAE (1x)
10 uL EtBr
Loading the Gel
add 10 uL loading dye (6x) to digests
add 40 uL of dye + digests to wells
don't forget to include wells with controls! (uncut plasmids)
load 10 uL ladder
run at 95 V for about an hour
!!note sizes of plasmids/inserts
GFP plasmid (pSB1A2) --> 2079 bp
GFP insert --> 720 bp
RFP plasmid (pSB2K3) --> 4425 bp
RFP insert --> 681 bp
Terminator plasmid (pSB1AK3) --> 3189 bp Terminator insert --> 39 bp
Gel Results
[add link to gel picture here]
All bands look fine except for, there were no bands for the terminators. They were so small they ran off the gel. We are considering using PCR purification to isolate these parts.
Gel Extraction
Follow QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit Protocol , skip isopropanol step and elute in 50 uL H20.

Laura's Lab notebook
worked with Karina and Francisco on digestions, gel, gel extraction (see Karina's notebook for details)
for digestion: Francisco set up RFP, Karina set up terminator, I set up GFP
