Key questions
For iGEM 2010 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects. Specifically, teams should consider the following questions:
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety
public safety, or
environmental safety
No, our project involves only standar laboratory procedures. Biosecurity level 1.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
NO
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
NO, the regulation is external to our university, the institution is named CIBIOGEM .
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How  could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
In our opinion, all the experiments or devices made by iGEM teams should be narrowed to the laboratory environment. Before any use of iGEM parts in nature, is necessary an open discussion and strict analysis.
