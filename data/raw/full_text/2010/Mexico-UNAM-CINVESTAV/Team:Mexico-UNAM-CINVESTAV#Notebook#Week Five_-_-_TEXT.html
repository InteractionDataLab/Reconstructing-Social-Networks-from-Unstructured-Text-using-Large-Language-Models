Week #5
04th  October - 08 October  2010
Monday
Picked up colonies of transformant cells and set up all for miniprep.
We used 30ml de LB medium per falcon tube with 35ng/ml
of cloramphenicol  and cultured overnight at 37ºC
Tuesday
The miniprep was prepared using Quiagen Kit.
Then we did a double digestion with EcoRI and PstI to check out the ligations.
DNA
5μl
Buffer NB2
1μl
EcoRI
0.5μl
PstI
0.5μl
H2O
2.7μl
BSA
0.3μl
Total
10μl
Wednesday
We ran a gel to confirm the ligations as follow:
PCR 1 Lig S with Psb1C3 Confirmed
PCR 2 Lig S with Psb1C3 Unconfirmed
PCR 3 Lig S with Psb1C3 Confirmed
PCR 4 Lig C with Psb1C3 Unconfirmed
We prepared all to repeat the ligation method: PCR2 with Psb1C3 and PCR4 with Psb1C3
Thursday
We did ligations (The LIGator Kit Amresco) PCR2 with Psb1C3 and PCR 4 with Psb1C3, then transformed DH5α
competent cells, and incubated at 37ºC overnight.
We ran a gel to test  biobricks with the follow results:
I0260   Positive Plate 2010
E0240   Positive Plate 2010
R010    Positive Plate 2010
J13002  Negative Plate 2007
Friday
We checked the  previous day ligation plates and we get  colonies of
PCR4 and not of PCR2
Today we discussed the reasons why we have not been succesfull to confirm the PCR2
maybe the ligation reaction is saturated
