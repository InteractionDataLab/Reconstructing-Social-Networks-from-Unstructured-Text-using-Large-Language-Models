Week #3
20th September -24th September 2010
Monday
Planned and prepared for tomorrow's electroporation
Electroporator departed.
Made up LB agar plates with cloramphenicol 35ng/ul.
We  planned how to transform Psb1C3 from plate.
We still looking for a nano spectrophotometer to quantify DNA’s concentrations
and tried to make ligations Psb1C3 with each  PCR product
( current  biobricks).
Tuesday
Transformed DH5α competent cells, and  kept 10 plates incubating 37ºC overnight.
Prepared solutions for miniprep via Alkalin lysis method.
Wednesday
Previous day transformations showed only two plates were sucessfully.
We kept the inoculated cells on  LB liquid medium at 37ºC overnight, four falcon tubes each containing  30ml.
Thursday
We did the miniprep however we do not get positive results
It could be that the solutions for alkalin lysis are not working.
We have discussed about the quantification of our cold sistem response
we are going to use a promoter system, the functional cassette with  J13002  as follow:
Promoter + our functional sequence + GFP (green fluorescent protein)
Promoter + our functional sequence + AFP (anti freeze protein)
We had a meeting with our Genomic's friends and we are going to get a
collaboration on Modeling and maybe also at wet lab.
