Week #7
18th  October - 22th October  2010
Monday
We prepared inoculum in 6 falcon tubes of  E0240 and I20260 each, after
nano espectophotometer readings we are going to need huge amounts of plasmid
Tuesday
With yesterday's inoculum we prepared six vials of culture to do miniprep and extracted from the band
we ran a agarosa's gel with 16μl per well, then precipitated with salts and alcohol the DNA and kept
overnight at -20°C'
Wednesday
We made the ligation with the one hour amresco kit and transformed in 4 plates
Aditional to this tried to ligate with Fermentas T4 this reaction is overnight at 4°
Thursday
We had transformant cells
We are goingo to use the previous ligations to caracterise our biobricks.
Friday
We send our biobricks good luck lab team
