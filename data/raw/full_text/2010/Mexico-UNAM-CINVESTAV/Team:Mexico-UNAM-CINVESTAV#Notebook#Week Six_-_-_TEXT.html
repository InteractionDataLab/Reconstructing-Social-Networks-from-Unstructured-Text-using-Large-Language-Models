Week #6
11th  October - 15 October  2010
Monday
We kept inoculated cells on LB liquid medium at 37ºC overnight, each containing 30ml.
Prepared miniprep for I20260 and E0240, we are going to work on the characterize the promoter
and the cold expresion casstte by RPU's.
Tuesday
Yesterday's overnight inoculum we did miniprep and double digestion with EcoRI and PstI
To confirm the ligation of PCR 4.

Wednesday
We ran a agarosa's gel to extract from the band E0240 and I20260.

We cut the agarosa's band and purified with the kit.
At the same time we ran the PCR's with EcoRI and PstI
