Human practices
Helping to promote the synthetic biology in our country we organized in the summer this year the first synthetic biology workshop of Mexico. We invite you to see in detail this in the section 1st Mexican Workshop in Synthetic Biology .
During the development of our project our team had serious problems with intellectual property and patents. For this reason we elaborate a survey with the objective to know the opinion of the community about these topics and promote the Biobrick Public Agreement. We invite you to see the survey results section .
We answered the safety questions in the safety section .
Finally our team is part of the Mexican Network of Synthetic Biology "Biosintetica". Biosintetica is  a non-profit organization. Currently is integrated by the UNAM (National Autonomous Univeristy of Mexico), the CINVESTAV (Advanced Research Center from the National Polytechnic Institute), and a selected group of Mexican companies.
