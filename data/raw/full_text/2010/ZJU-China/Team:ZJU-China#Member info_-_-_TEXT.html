Team Information
Visa tour in Shanghai
College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University
    Zhejiang University iGEM team includes nearly 20 students from vast varied backgrounds, such as biology, mathematics, computer science and telecommunication. Most of the team members have excellent grades and great insight on their specific areas. After a whole year working together to prepare for the iGEM competition, all of us become very familiar with each other and firmed to a solid team.
What will it be if 20 brilliant minds clash?
    That'll be ZJU-CHINA, made of 20 creative and passionate young researches from various departments, a team of wonder.
