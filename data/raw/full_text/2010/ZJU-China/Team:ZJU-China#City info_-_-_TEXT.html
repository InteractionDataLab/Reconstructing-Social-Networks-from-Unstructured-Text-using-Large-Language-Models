Ever-Changing and Indescribable Beauty
    Sunny or rainy, Hangzhou looks its best in spring. However, the charm of Hangzhou is never tarnished with change of the season. In summer, lotus flowers bloom. Their fragrance brings joy to one's soul and refreshes the mind. Autumn brings with it the sweet scent of osmanthus flowers along with chrysanthemums in full bloom. In winter, the wintry snow scenes can be likened to an exquisite jade carving. Hangzhou's beauty is ever changing but never fails to entice and entrance.

    The West Lake is undoubtedly the most renowned feature of Hangzhou, noted for the scenic beauty that blends naturally with many famous historical and cultural sites. It is like a mirror, embellished all around with green hills and deep caves of enchanting beauty. The Su Causeway which runs from north to south and the Bai Causeway which runs from east to west look like two colored ribbons floating on the water. Hill peaks tower around the lake. Scattered in the adjacent hills are scenic caves and caverns, most of which have many stone sculptures carved on their walls.  Also among the hills one finds springs everywhere.

Beautiful Scenery and Exquisite Art
    Hangzhou's beauty has cultivated and inspired generations of artists: poets, writers, painters and calligraphers, who throughout the centuries, have left behind immortal poems, essays, paintings and calligraphy in praise of Hangzhou. A poet who once lived in Hangzhou wrote,
Poem
So fair is the River's South, Where pretty scenes did I well know. The sunrise basks the blooms in fiery glow, And the spring waters of blue as sapphire flow. How can my nostalgia cease for the River's South？
    Moreover, Hangzhou's folk art and handicrafts are rich and imaginative. Their vivid and unique style holds great attraction for tourists. Hangzhou has a long history of textile production, especially known for the fine silk and related products.
Hangzhou local cuisines
    Hangzhou food is representative of the cuisine of southern China. The charm of the ancient cuisine has been recognized since the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220).
    Reminiscent of the romantic scenery around Hangzhou, these dishes are delicate, tender, refreshing and crisp. All ingredients used in the cooking come from the fertile land around the city, known as a land of plenty.
