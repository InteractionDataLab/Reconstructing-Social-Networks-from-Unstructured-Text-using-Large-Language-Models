Bach: Gene Composer
    Bach is a gene composer software that optimizes coding sequences and calculates corresponding RiPS to illustrate their translation rates. In sequence optimization, Bach incorporates 4 distinct approaches from which users can freely choose: SYNONYMOUS SUBSTITUTION, SLOW, FAST and MATCH. In the last section of GET RIPS, users are provided with a quantitative view of the translational behavior of the input coding sequence and the four sequences produced by the four methods as well.
    Run Bach for the following research needs:
heterologous protein expression
Evaluation of translation rates and behavior
Design of more predictable and robust genetic circuits
    Run Bach for the following benefits:
Diverse optimization approaches of choice
Quantitative Analysis of translational behavior
Free and easy to use
