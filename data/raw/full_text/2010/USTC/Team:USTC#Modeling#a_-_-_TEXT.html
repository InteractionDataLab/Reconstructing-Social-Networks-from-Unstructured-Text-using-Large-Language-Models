An Integrated Platform Based on Bacterial Microcompartment for de novo Proteinaceous Artificial Organelles
Known Conditions
This table illustrate some basic information of pdu shell protein family. [1]
Table 1| Basic information of pdu shell protein family.
Figure 1| 3-dimension structure of the known shell proteins from Salmonella enterica . UPPER: pduU. [2] MIDDLE: pduA. [3] DOWN：pduT. [3 ]
Hypothesis
I）Pdu N is the vertex and its pentametic structuresfor its identity with a proved vertex pentametic protein---CcmL. [4]
II) Hexamers forms the facets, which comprises the building blocks of bacterial microcompartment shells. [5]
Figure 2| LEFT: A diagram showing the construction of a large icosahedron from many smaller hexagons and 12 pentagons at the vertices. The figure shown has a triangulation number (T) of 75 (29). RIGHT: Individual CsoS1A  molecules, typical shell proteins, are differently in each hexamer.
III) Similarity of the shell proteins to the carboxysome [6] and carboxysome is believed to be in icosohedral shape.
Results
From the paper data of EM observation:
Then we decide to count the molecular copies of each structural basic element.
Relative abundance [6 ]
pdu -J:-A:-B':-B:-K:-T:-U=15:10:7:6:1:1:2
the diameter of a hexamer is 7 nm
the edge is 3.5 nm
the area of a hexamer is 31.8255 nm2
then the number of hexamer is 23936.353 nm2/31.8255 nm2=752.11
So. in total 752 hexamers
Because B, B' and T have two BMC domains, so they form trimer instead
(15t+10t+t+2t)/6+(7t+6t+t)/3=752 => t=77.8

Conclusion
Explanation about the size.
Typical size of a prokaryotes is 1~10 µm
Diameter of a Pdu Microcompartment is 100nm=0.1 µm
Volume of a Pdu Microcompartment is 317018.839 nm3 ~=320000 nm3=3.2*105 nm3=3.2*10-4 µm3
Bacterium, are about 2 µm long and 0.5 µm in diameter, with a cell volume of 0.6 - 0.7 µm3
=> Conclusion: about 1875 Pdu microcompartments can fill a bacterial cell！
