To start our project, I begin a detailed study of biology related softwares, including SynBioSS, CellDesigner and TinkerCell. Especially, TinkerCell is a open source software, so I can read it's source code to carefully research biology simulation software.  Those softwares provide me a lot of ideas, direct our development and influence our design.
