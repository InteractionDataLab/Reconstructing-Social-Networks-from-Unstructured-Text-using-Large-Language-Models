An Integrated Platform Based on Bacterial Microcompartment for de novo Proteinaceous Artificial Organelles
OVERVIEW
Many bacteria have sophisticated proteinaceous inclusions that serve as organelles for specific metabolic pathways. To construct an integrated platform for de novo proteinaceous artificial organelles, we select Citrobacter freundii microcompartment associated with 1,2-propanediol utilization(pdu) as the base of our engineering. We have cloned the shell genes – pduA, pduB, pduJ, pduK, pduN, pduT and pduU, in a new assembly standard RFC53, as well as the conventional standard RFC10. Proteins extract from strain expressing pdu genes have been analyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm their identity , and BMC in E.coli is imaged by Electron microscope and confocal microscope as a visual evidence for successful formation of BMC in E.coli.
