An Integrated Platform Based on Bacterial Microcompartment for de novo Proteinaceous Artificial Organelles
In the section of modeling, our goal is to visualize an artificial organelle of capacity. We divide this task into two part:
I) Calculate the volume of bacterial microcompartment; Go to part A
II) Summarize the co-evolution relationship between pdu picrocompartment in order to shed light upon the material we want to package into the pocket. Go to part B
