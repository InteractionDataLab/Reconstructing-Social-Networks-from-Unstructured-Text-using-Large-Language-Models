What a pity! But they will join us at the iGEM 2010 Jamboree.
</P><P>USTC has formed two IGEM teams this year, one wet lab team and one dry lab team. As many students majoring in biology was attracted to the wet lab team, our team consists of students from other departments, such as Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science and so on. Thanks to our instructors <B>Hao Jiang</B> and <B>Zhaofeng Luo</B>, with their professional instruction, we are guided to decide the project plan, design and implementation.

The meetup started around 9 with a short speech by Professor Lin He, head of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Bio-X Institute, which hosted the event. Then each team made a presentation displaying their projects and progresses since the summer began, followed by free questioning and discussion time. And when it was near the end of the day, student members had a hour or two to talk and play freely with each other, with a big meal waiting ahead for them.
