Learining from other biology reaction network simulation software – Berkeley Software Team 2009, SynBioSS, TinkerCell, CellDesigner, because the realization of our game need simulation too. Thinking about the big picture of our game, the simulation, the UI, the database, the play modes. (Liao)Chen Liao promoted a way to do the simulation – every biobrick will have an input and an output.
