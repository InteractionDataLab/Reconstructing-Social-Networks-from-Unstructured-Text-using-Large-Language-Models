Idea of starting a community has been discussed with the wet team and will be realized soon. Concerned with IPR issue, I consult the IPRs Centre of USTC for safety of iGAME. Start of wiki scripts.
Summary: Finally, I decide to give a name to the human practice project, "the C project". "C" stands for "curriculum","communication" and "community", it is also cool, huh?
