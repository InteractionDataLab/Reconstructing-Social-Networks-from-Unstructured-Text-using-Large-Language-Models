Today I make an investigation report to the whole USTC Software Team members. The main content is the basic principle of Bio-oscillation according to the article “Synchronized bacterial clocks” Nature Vol 463|21 January 2010 and “A synchronized quorum of genetic clocks” Nature Vol 463| 21 January 2010| doi:10.1038. After presentation we have a brainstorm, think deeply about the engineered gene network with global intercellular coupling that is capable of generating synchronized oscillations in a growing population of cells.
