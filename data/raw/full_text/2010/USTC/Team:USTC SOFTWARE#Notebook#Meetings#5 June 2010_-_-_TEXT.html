Jun 14 ~ Jun 20, 2010 I write a PPT on UI and give a draft of my design, the PPT focuses on input and output. The design of input seems pretty good, but we get stuck in output. How should we present the result to players? It is a hard question. We decide to add drag and drop features throughout the game to make it easier to use and play.
