Plan: Think about what database modification tool a senior user would like to use. Write full database that includes the whole oscillator. Read more on XML. Have fun working.
Summary: Not having much fun working, with both sides’ tasks to be done. Full database for oscillator is done 2010/9/2. I haven’t checked it in detail yet. It is very likely we are going to change the db structure yet again, good thing though. Learn from libsbml the sbml modification tool, our db modification should somehow like that. It should focus on adding and constructing new model. Discuss on UI&input with Liao, writing the new UI draft.
