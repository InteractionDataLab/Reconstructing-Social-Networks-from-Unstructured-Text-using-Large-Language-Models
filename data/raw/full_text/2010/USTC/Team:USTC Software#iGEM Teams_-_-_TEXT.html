Cooperation with USTC wet team
It's always a good experience working with our wet team through the whole summer. During the process of iGEM 2010, we learn from each other and help each other to achieve more! This year we cooperate with USTC team in modeling and human practice. Read the following sections for more details.
Modeling
This year the team of USTC focuses on the construction a Host-cell-free Reaction Chamber using Synthetic Biology methods. We help them to visualize an artificial organelle of capacity. For more details, please refer to our wet team's modeling page .
Human Practice
This year, we also had close collaboration with USTC wet team on human practice, for the simple reason that none of us is biology major and we had to resort to biology major fellows for professional advice. Besides, we had several activities together; we presented several campus lectures promoting both synthetic biology and IGEM, and we started our IGEM community together. The collaboration with them not only enhanced the quality of our work, but improved the biology knowledge of our own.
iGEM2010 China Meetup Shanghai
Something amazing happened at Shanghai this summer. On August 5th, USTC_Software, together with teams from 6 other top universities in China, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, ECUST-Shanghai, Peking, Tsinghua, USTC, ZJU-China, and Sun Yat-sen University all gathered in Shanghai and had a nice day at the iGEM 2010 China Meetup. Visit China meetup to find more!
Help with surveys
Penn State & Warsaw Team
This year Penn State iGEM team created a survey about Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) in Agriculture. The survey included questions about where and when GMOs should be used, GMOs containing a lysis device, and other questions dealing with the use of GMOs. USTC Software iGEMers are happy to be participants in the survey, and we wish a good result will come out! We also help team Warsaw fill out their survey forms.
