Write a PPT on the framework of our game, which focused on database. We came to the conclusion that the database should have the following features, quick search, links to reactions, inheritance between different parts, easy to add elements, and most of them are still suitable now(Aug, 2010).

Start to study Qt4 , HTML , JavaScript , CSS and some other computer technology , to prepare for the project . When we've already decided to make a biological game , I took the charge of designing the story of the game , so I moved to it.
