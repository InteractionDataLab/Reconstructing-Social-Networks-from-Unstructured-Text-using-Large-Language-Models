Team:USTC/Notebook
From 2010.igem.org
An Integrated Platform Based on Bacterial Microcompartment for de novo Proteinaceous Artificial Organelles
Preliminary work
From Feb.4th to Feb.13th, a Team:USTC/Gallery collective training is held targeting to the practice of basic experiment. Setting GFP protein expression system as an example, we learn from the program how to construct standard components and then an expression system. It`s the time we get to know each other and become a team as a whole.
The contents of the training are listed as followed:
1. outlines
2. E.coli culture (Medium preparation, Inoculation, Aseptic operation)
3. plasmid extraction
4. PCR
5. DNA Electrophoresis
6. Double Digest
7. reclaim and appraise of the product of enzyme cutting
8. Ligation
9. preparation of competent cell
10.  genomic screening of masculine clone
11.  DNA sequencing
Lab Notebook
Meetings are set every Saturday since Feb.15th, then three more discussions (Mon, Wes, Fri) are added when we start to determine our project since Mar 21th.
2010.4.10 – 2010.5.14  reports of the former iGEM works
2010.5.21 – 2010.6.11  broach of candidate projects
cell density control
Reporter and imaging
DNA writing and reading in the cell
Biodegradation of plastics
2010.6.12 – 2010.6.30  further research by small groups on the candidate projects
sketch map of our final project host-cell free reaction chamber was set up
All the reports information, slides and audio records of our meetings are arranged here.
