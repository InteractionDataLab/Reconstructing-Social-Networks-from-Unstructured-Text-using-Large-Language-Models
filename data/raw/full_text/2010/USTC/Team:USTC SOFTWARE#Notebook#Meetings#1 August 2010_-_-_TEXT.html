At first we want to use MySQL to manage our database, later we find Berkeley DBXML is a better tool, so I studied on how to use DBXML. Kun Jiang quickly write an interface using DBXML API and a small PDF instruction, code genius! Finish database format v3.0 – the 3rd version of database, now there are 4 lists, the global, the module, the species, the reactions. Global list stores data that must be pre-defined. Specify database format and give detailed examples on each list. In order to realize the real species, we add substituent in module and chain in species(special thanks to Hao Jiang).
