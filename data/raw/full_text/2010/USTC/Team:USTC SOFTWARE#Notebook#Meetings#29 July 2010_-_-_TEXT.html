Start of our human practice.  Summer classes of synthesis biology begin and are lectured by Prof. Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, both of who are advisors of our team. After communicating with Prof. Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, I decide to do many things along with the curriculum. Surveys are written and done for the synthesis biology class. Lectures are also prepared for it. Much communication with other teams and people is done, which is quite educational and impressive.(it's fun, too!)
