An Integrated Platform Based on Bacterial Microcompartment for de novo Proteinaceous Artificial Organelles
Part Ⅰ: Fusion Proteins to Identify the Localization of BMC
From the following picture(Fig 1), we can identify the structure and Localization of BMC.
Fig 1: Results of fusion protein --- RFP-A
Part Ⅱ: Fusion Proteins for Transportation into BMC
The series of studies presented here demonstrates that a short N-terminal peptide is necessary and sufficient for association of proteins with BMC and likely mediates packaging within the interior of BMC.
Fig 2: Results of fusion protein --- PduP_L-GFP
Part Ⅲ: Fusion Proteins for BMC Purification
The localization of BMC can be observed in Fig 3, which is expressed by the fusion protein of PduV[1-98] and GFP.
