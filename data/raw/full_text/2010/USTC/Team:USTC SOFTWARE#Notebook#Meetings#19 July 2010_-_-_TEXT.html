I Find myself have little knowledge about partregistry, so I read registry and summarize promoter, plasmid backbones, protein coding sequence, degradation reaction, plasmid, etc. The first edition of oscillator database pack and database documentation has been written by Liao, I only give some suggestions on naming our modules, and make little contribution on the whole thing.
