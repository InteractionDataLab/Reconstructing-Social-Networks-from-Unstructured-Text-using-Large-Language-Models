Jun 7 ~ Jun 13, 2010 We find Antimony is a good way to translate SBML files into human readable form, so I read some documents on libsbml. Liao and I discussed on the project of PKU2009, we both agreed the simulation of it will be a tough job.
Jun 14 ~ Jun 20, 2010 I write a PPT on UI and give a draft of my design, the PPT focuses on input and output. The design of input seems pretty good, but we get stuck in output. How should we present the result to players? It is a hard question. We decide to add drag and drop features throughout the game to make it easier to use and play.

Now we have two choices: developing the whole process of simulation and model by ourselves or learn from other existing software and utilize APIs as much as possible Start to learn some knowledge about SBML and libxml as we will use them as format of presentation and interaction.

Passing the Horrible Examing season , there's little time for me to concentrate on the project  , so in this month , i can only do some other stuff , like learning Flash , how to make a page on internet.
