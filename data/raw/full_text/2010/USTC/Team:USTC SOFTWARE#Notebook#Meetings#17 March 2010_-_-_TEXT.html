Having made sure that our project will be about a game in synthetic biology, we begin to discuss the components of our software. Basically, we divide it into two parts: fore-end and back-end. I will work on the later one which includes simulation, database, interface, etc. Furthermore, I focus on the model and simulation of biological reactions and try to find a proper method to serve for our project.
