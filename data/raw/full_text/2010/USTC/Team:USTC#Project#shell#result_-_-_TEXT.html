An Integrated Platform Based on Bacterial Microcompartment for de novo Proteinaceous Artificial Organelles
In the expression of protein, we use and unite the method mentioned in the previous papers. [see protocol] The bacterial was induced by 1 mM IPTG at 30 ℃ for 4 hours. The results was as follows.[the one without pduN was a negative control used to prove the function of pduN: in the growth process, the one without pduN tends to grow with more deposit implying its possible role in the vertex]
We use the ultracentrifuge to purify the proteins, with 48000 g speed, we get our targeted proteins in the pellet.
Finally, we got the E.coli with the Pdu microcompartment tested in TEM
We are excited to see the result we expected, in this TEM result we can see the Pdu microcompartment were successfully assemblied in E.coli.
