igame in github!
To help cooperation in our teams. I decide to use a version control software to help to manage our source code. Because our team members come from different department and we don't live together, especially me, I live ten kilometers far away from USTC. So a distributed Version control System is needed. Git is the chosen one!
We create a repository igame in github , and our team member can get the source by using git with git URL git@github.com:jkdirac/igame.git.
