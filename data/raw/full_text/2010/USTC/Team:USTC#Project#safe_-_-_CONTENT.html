What measure do you think we should take to prevent that?</P><P><EM>'You are probably doing the engineering in an E. coli laboratory strain - which is quite safe and unlikely to survive if released. Moreover, there is no evidence that the BMC confers any great advantage - E. coli has already lost the pdu operon so it cannot be that important.'</EM></P><P>2) Beside doing the experiment,we have already organized a campus-wide talk to extend awareness on synthetic biology as well as to instill a scientific and responsible attitude towards it.To what extent do you think that can help eliminate people's panic over our work? Have you ever done something similar?</P><P><EM>'The important thing is not to be arrogant with science - take on people's concerns and answer each question they raise. Synthetic biology is an amalgamation of genetic and metabolic engineering. As such, Nature has been doing this for 3.5 billion years. We still have a lot to learn and we do have to be careful. Nonetheless, synthetic biology offers genuine hope for the enhanced production of biofuels, vitamins, drugs and chemicals, which is managed properly could enhance the lives of many people worldwide.'</EM></P><P><STRONG>Also we consulted Prof. Bobik, Thomas A, who is also an expert in BMC.<A href="http://www.biomedexperts.com/Profile.bme/130876/Thomas_A_Bobik" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[3]</A>.</STRONG></P><P>Here is his reply.</P><P><EM>In my opinion there is no chance that engineering a microcompartment into E. coli will create a superbug. Such microcompartments are already produced by certain species of E. coli and they are not superbugs. Moreover, most genetic changes made the lab reduce the fitness of the organism in nature. The microcompartment is not associated with any major virulence factors or toxins. Martin Warren’s group in Kent UK has made a Citrobacter MCP in E. coli. Comprehensive lab procedures to prevent the escape of engineered organisms, potentially harmful or not, should be used.</EM></P><P><STRONG>Thanks to them ,our primary concerns are lifted.Thank you very much for your help and kindness!O(∩_∩)O~</STRONG></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Key_Questions">Key Questions</SPAN></H2><P>For iGEM 2010 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects.
