Liao Chen
Liao Chen (7.20): Discuss framework of core programme of simulation part of our project with Jiang
Hao. We decided to take consideration of the structure of complex, which solves problems we encountered when handling reactions with regard to complex molecules.
Liao Chen (7.21): We decided to model the species (either complex or simple species) using two data
structures:
ChainList is used to describe chains of DNA, RNA or Protein molecules. Small molecules are also
of such structure with only one element on one chain.
Tree structure is used to describe binding state of elements of different chains. Children nodes
bind with each other and form their parent node. Thus, other than chains, a species has its binding state forest, which composed of many trees mentioned above.
Liao Chen (7.22): We decided to store data of species and reactions in XML format.
Liao Chen (7.23): To search reactions of species includes, we need powerful support of species and
reactions database. But first, we need a database manager to manage our XML data files, which must provide query operation of data we want.
Liao Chen (7.24): We find it! Oracle Berkeley DB XML! It is a Native XML Database. It is capable of
storing and indexing collections of XML documents in both native and mapped forms for highly efficient querying, transformation, and retrieval.
Liao Chen (7.25): A well designed database is quite important for our project. Start to design file
organization and format of database files.
Liao Chen (7.26~7.30): Discussion with Jiang Hao about how to design database. We decide to make 4
file containers to hold different kind of contents:
global : contains unit definition, definition of standard conditions of cultivating bacterial, and
so on.
module : module of each species, including biobricks, virtual biobricks, cells, plasmids,
substituents and so on.
species : each species that occurs in reactions defined in reaction container is defined here.
reactions : reactions of all species defined in species container are defined here.
Zhen Wang
Jul 19 ~ Jul 25, 2010 I Find myself have little knowledge about partregistry, so I read registry and summarize promoter, plasmid backbones, protein coding sequence, degradation reaction, plasmid, etc. The first edition of oscillator database pack and database documentation has been written by Liao, I only give some suggestions on naming our modules, and make little contribution on the whole thing.
Jul 26 ~ Aug 1, 2010 Talk together with Hao Jiang and Liao, write the second edition of oscillator database and database format. In order to deal with the real reactions and real species, we add virtual biobricks to our database, together with a bunch of new attributes. The database is constructed by 3 lists, the single compartment list, the species structure list, the reaction list, relationship of the 3 lists is shown in the following picture.[pic]
Kun Jiang
Study the CMake, a project manage tool for huge software project, and QT, a cross-platform application and UI framework. Try to develop a demo project.
Luojun Wang
Start of our human practice.  Summer classes of synthesis biology begin and are lectured by Prof. Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, both of who are advisors of our team. After communicating with Prof. Haiyan Liu and Jiong Hong, I decide to do many things along with the curriculum. Surveys are written and done for the synthesis biology class. Lectures are also prepared for it. Much communication with other teams and people is done, which is quite educational and impressive.(it's fun, too!)
Shangyu Luo
Jul 19 ~ Jul 25, 2010 As the problem with simulation has finally been solved, I turn to acquire some knowledge about database which will be a huge and basic part of our project and then begin a long period cooperation with Zhen Wang. Obtain the classification of database: network database, hierarchical database, relational database
Jul 26 ~ Aug 1, 2010 have a general idea of database and have a discussion with Hao Jiang, Zhen Wang, Chen Liao frequently to deal with some difficulties in the construction of database, as well as some biological problem.
