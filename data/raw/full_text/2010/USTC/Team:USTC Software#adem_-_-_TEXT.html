We have succesfully constructed the modeling of project of USTC 2009 iGEM team. Due to various reasons, the result will be shown in our final release of our software as a demo. This work could perfectly illustrate the features of our software. It include many novel biological process, such as  quorem sensing, multi-compartment, and cell killing to death. There are more than 100 reactions in total, which is almost impossible to model manually, which, in turns, shows great power of our software.
To have a first look, we provide a screenshot of the results about single compartment which contains plasmid (shown as below)
. For more details, please run our example.
