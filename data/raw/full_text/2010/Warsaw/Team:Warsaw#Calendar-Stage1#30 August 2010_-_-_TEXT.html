30.08.2010 Monday
Previous day: Set up liquid cultures of E.coli TOP10 with measured constructs [Ania P.]
We used a protocol described here
Testing the strenght of RBS [Ania P.,Cherry]
Preparation of samples by dilluting the bacteria cultures and examining them in flow cytometer (all according the protocol , but each RBS preformed from one independent culture)
Data analysis with Cell Quest and Microsoft Excel[Cherry]

FSC- Forward Scatter, cell size
SSC- Side Scatter, cell complexity
FL-1- FL-1 sensor, cell fluorescence
