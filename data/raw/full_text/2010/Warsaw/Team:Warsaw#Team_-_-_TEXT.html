Michał Lower
I come from Warsaw, our capital city :-). I study Biotechnology at University of Warsaw. My M. Sc. thesis in Department of Virology was about new method of rapid determination of type III DNA methyltransferase recognition sequences. Apart from molecular biology I'm passionated with computer programming.
prof. dr hab. Jacek Bielecki
Education: MSc, University of Warsaw, 1975 ;PhD, University of Warsaw, 1981 ;Associated professor, Warsaw University, 1995; Professor at University of Warsaw, 1996 ;Vice Dean of Faculty of Biology, 1996 - 1999, and 1999-2002
Research interests: Molecular mechanisms of virulence of bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, especially the role of a hemolysin, listeriolysin O (LLO).
Anna Olchowik
I am a final year biotechnology student at the University of Edinburgh. You can usually find me in the lab watching youtube. Yes, I am responsible for this webpage, you can blame me for all the errors. Or, better blame the on-line tutorials, that I am using. Apart from biology I love traveling, ice skating and computer science.
Jarosław Pankowski
I live near Warsaw and I study Biotechnology at the University of Warsaw. My M. Sc. thesis in Department of Genetic of Bacteria is about plasmid and chromosome encoded ability of marine bacteria to form biofilm. Besides the science I'm interested in fantasy books, metal music and for some time long sword fencing.
Kamila Ornoch
I come from Warsaw and study Biotechnology at University of Warsaw. My B. Sc. thesis in Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology was about intracellular localization of Suv3 protein from Danio rerio. Now I'm working on yeast in International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology. And I love to climb :)
Kamil Koper
I come from a small town in south-east Poland, but I spent most of my life living in Warsaw. I study Biotechnology at the Warsaw University in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology. My B. Sc. thesis focused on human mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms and their correlation with the occurrence of specific forms of cancer. If I'm not in the lab or out playing billiards with friends you can usually find me in my workshop, or playing vintage video games.
Jakub Piątkowski
I'm a graduate student at the University of Warsaw (Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology). My research interests include RNA turnover in mitochondria and the evolution of organellar genomes. My B.Sc. and M.Sc. theses focused on a novel RNA-binding protein DMR1p in S. cerevisiae. Whenever possible, I also try to participate in the activities of the students’ societies: of Molecular and Synthetic Biology.
Marcin Ziemniak
I am a student of chemistry and biotechnology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. My scientific interests include all aspects of bioorganic and theoretical chemistry connected with biopolymers, and some fields of biology involving synthetic and structural biology. Actually I am working in Division of Biophysics, UW and try to synthesize some new analogues of 5’ mRNA cap structures with superior biological properties. Moreover, I am about to finish my B. Sc thesis which is linked to chromatin remodeling. Besides my scientific work, I like listening to metal music and reading books especially science-fiction novels.
Anna Saffray
I am a high school student who's hobby is going to the laboratory , and one beautiful day will become a scientist. I have also another hobbby - spending time with my horse and my dogs .
Radosław Stachowiak
My adventure with biology and biotechnology dates back to 1995 when I became a biotechnology student at University of Warsaw. In the year 2000 I completed my MSc thesis and I guess I couldn’t stop there so I immidiately started PhD studies. Now I’m done with studying and my job is to take care of students and introduce them into science. Still, I like being involved in crazy projects so characteristic of Sudents’ Societies. The more crazy and incredible project the better. I guess this is the case so here I am!
Justyna Lesiak
I am a PhD student at the Technischer Universität München, I just graduated in Biology at University of Warsaw. Now I am working on solventogenic Clostridia as a participant of the UE Clostridia Programme and trying to learn German (Hochdeutsch und Bairisch[!]), which seems to be not that difficult, as some people claim. In my spare time I like to listen to classical music, read books, do irish dancing and horseback riding.
Ania Puławska
I'm Anna I study biotechnology at Warsaw University, precisely in Department of Virology. I am sure that this is exactly where I should be:) Probably I'm the happiest student in Warsaw:D
Apart from my duties, I have many hobbies. I love traveling, drawing (check the home page graphic), snowboarding in winter or sailing in spring:) What more can I say? I'm an optimist^^
Kasia Grześ
I study biotechnology on Warsaw University (Institute of Bacterial Genetics). I'm on the last year of my studies and my work here is connected with Heat Shock Proteins, especially bacterial Hsp90 and it's interactions with other proteins. During my free time I spend a lot of time in the... kitchen, I simply love cooking. Maybe in some way it reminds working in the lab...;)
Dominik Cysewski
I come from Wroclaw, most charming city of Poland;-) I'm a graduate student at the University of Warsaw (Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology). Now I'm working on cross-linking of protein complexes and mapping them. Science is fascinating of course... But my hobby is mountaineering.
Marta Błaszkiewicz
Vice-praeses of Students' Society of Genetics and Epigenetics
Genetics, neurobiology, computer science (a little bit of programming and graphics ^^), swimming, hiking,  concerts, RPG, fantasy books, anime...  Loving all of it (and much more!), I'm studying biotechnology at the College of Interfaculty  Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. As for now I can tell that my B. Sc thesis will be connected with metagenomics.
Joanna Leszczyńska
Hi! My name is Joanna. I am a Pharmacy student at Medical University of Warsaw.  I believe that the cure to every possible disease is already known to mankind, but we still need to find a way to deliver it to the right place in human body, in right amounts. This is why I'm most interested in drug delivery systems.We still have a looong way to go... You wanna join?
Albert Bogdanowicz
I come from Szczecin. I study Bioinformatics and Systems Biology in Warsaw. As you might expect, I learn biology and code a lot. When I don't do this, I'm travelling, climbing, playing RPG, watching movies...
In my iGEM team, I'm the main software developer.
Cherry Moreno studies medical biotechnology in the Department of Immunology at Warsaw Uniwersity, where she works with LPS, natural regulatory T cells and their Tool-like receptors. She sings in a Russian Orthodox Choir, her father comes from Panama and she hates itchy clothes labels. She loves dancing, watching nature and flow cytometry!!!
Milena Bażlekowa
Hi everyone! My name is Milena and I study medical biotechnology at Warsaw University. I am a Bachelor's degree graduate, curently working on my M.Sc. thesis. My thesis is focused on molecular cloning and genetical engineering of Vsr endonucleases and functional complementation of E. coli's Vsr by N. gonorrhoeae's Vsrs(sounds scary, isn't it ;))?. Last year I went on an internship at the University of California San Diego working with Mark Tuszynski's lab at the Center for Neural Repair UCSD School of Medicine. During the internship I had experience working with neural growth factors and their implementations in various neorodegenerative diseases e.g. Alzheimer's disease or spinal cord injury. Apart from medical applications of synthetic biology, I am interested in computer graphics, art and Mexican cuisine :). I like drawing, taking photographs and travelling.
