Checking correctness of biobriks - approach 2 [Ania P., Kasia, Jarek]
We're still checking: GFP-terminator, J61100 J61101 J61107 J61117 J61127 [Anderson's RBSes], B0030 B0031 B0032 B0033 B0034 [community RBSes], J23100 [synthetic promoter].
1. Alkaline lysis no2.
2. Run 10 ul of DNA on the agarose gel.
Unfortunately we've got small amount of plasmids.
