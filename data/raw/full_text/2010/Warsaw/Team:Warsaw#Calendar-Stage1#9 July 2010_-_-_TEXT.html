Cloning GFP-terminator behind RBSes - approach 2 [Ania P., ..]
1. Electrophoresis of samples from 08.07 (samples 39- to the end)
2. Choice of proper clones based on these two electrophoresis results (08-09.07):
B0030/GFP -> sample 7.2G,
B0031/GFP -> sample 8.1E,
B0032/GFP -> sample 9.1A,
B0033/GFP -> sample 10.1F,
B0034/GFP -> sample 11.1P.
3. DNA of these clones used to transformation.
Preparing glycerol stocks of Anderson's RBSes/GFP-terminator [Ania P., ..]
1. Set up 2 ml liquid culture of clones obtained on the plates with ampicillin (from 7.07).
