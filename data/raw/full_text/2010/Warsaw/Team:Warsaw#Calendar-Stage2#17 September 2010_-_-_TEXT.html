Mutagenesis of MinC
Kuba
Four colonies were picked for inoculation of liquid cultures. Cultures were grown for 6 h in 37 oC. Plasmids were purified with Plasmid Mini kit (A&A) biotechnology. The obtained sample, as well as the initial (unmutated) plasmid, were then digested with EcoRI and PstI for 1 h and run on agarose gel.
C - unmutated plasmid; M - size marker; 1,2,3,4 -respective samples
The shorter band in samples 1,2,3 appears to be slightly longer compared to control, indicating a succesfull mutagenesis. These conclusions were later verified by sequencing.
