Cloning GFP-terminator behind RBSes - approach 1 [Ania S., Ania P., Kasia, Cherry]
1. Cultures from 6.07.2010 were centrifuged -> sediments in the eppendorfs were light green.
2. Alkaline lysis of these 'green cultures'.
3. Inoculation of Petri plates with ampicillin.
-> Transformation results from 6.07.2010: clones were green during exposition to UV light -> we inoculated the plates with ampicillin.
Cloning GFP-terminator behind RBSes - approach 2. [Ania S., Ania P., Kasia, Cherry]
1. Clones obtained on the plates after transformation were used to set up liquid cultures (per 2 ml). We've got 10-20 tubes with cultures from each plate (B0030/GFP = our number 7, B0031/GFP = our number 8, B0032/GFP = our number 9, B0033/GFP = our number 10, B0034/GFP = our number 11)
