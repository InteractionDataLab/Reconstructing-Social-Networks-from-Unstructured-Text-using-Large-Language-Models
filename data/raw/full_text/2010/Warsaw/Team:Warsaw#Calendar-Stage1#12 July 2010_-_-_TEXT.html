Cloning GFP+terminator behind Anderson's RBSes
1. Finish the alkaline lysis from Saturday 10.07, samples: 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1
2. Digest samples 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1 (Anderson's RBSes+GFPterminator) with EcoRI + PstI to examine the correctness of obtained constructs.
3. Gel electrophoresis.[Gel 1]
4. All constructs are of the expected size.
Cloning Community RBSes+GFP+terminator behind J23100
1. Digest sample 12.1 J23100[synthetic promoter] with SpeI(Bcu)+ PstI,
2. Gel electrophoresis [Gel 3]
3. Digest community RBSes-GFP-terminator, samples: 7.2 G, 8.1 E, 9.1 A, 11.1 P, 10.1 F with XbaI + PstI
4. Gel electrophoresis [Gel 2, Gel 3]
5.  Ligation of sample 12.1 J23100 [promoter] with the community RBSes-GFP-terminator samples: 7.2 G, 8.1 E, 9.1 A, 11.1 P, 10.1 F
