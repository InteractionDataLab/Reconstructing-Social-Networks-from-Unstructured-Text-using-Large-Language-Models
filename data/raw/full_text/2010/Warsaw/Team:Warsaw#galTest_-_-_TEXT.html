Michał Lower I come from Warsaw, our capital city :-). I study Biotechnology at University of Warsaw. My M. Sc. thesis in Department of Virology was about new method of rapid determination of type III DNA methyltransferase recognition sequences. Apart from molecular biology I'm passionated with computer programming.
prof. dr hab. Jacek Bielecki
Education: MSc, University of Warsaw, 1975 ;PhD, University of Warsaw, 1981 ;Associated professor, Warsaw University, 1995; Professor at University of Warsaw, 1996 ;Vice Dean of Faculty of Biology, 1996 - 1999, and 1999-2002
Research interests: Molecular mechanisms of virulence of bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, especially the role of a hemolysin, listeriolysin O (LLO).
Anna Olchowik I am a final year biotechnology student at the University of Edinburgh. You can usually find me in the lab watching youtube. Yes, I am responsible for this webpage, you can blame me for all the errors. Or, better blame the on-line tutorials, that I am using. Apart from biology I love traveling, ice skating and computer science.
Jarosław Pankowski I live near Warsaw and I study Biotechnology at the University of Warsaw. My B. Sc. thesis in Department of Genetic of Bacteria is about plasmids found in marine bacteria. Besides the science I'm interested in fantasy books, metal music and for some time in sword fighting.
Kamila Ornoch I come from Warsaw and study Biology at University of Warsaw. My B. Sc. thesis in Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology is about intracellular localization of Suv3 protein from Danio rerio. And I love to climb: high is my infatuation :)
Kamil Koper I come from a small town in south-east Poland, but I spent most of my life living in Warsaw. I study Biotechnology at the Warsaw University in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology. My B. Sc. thesis focused on human mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms and their correlation with the occurrence of specific forms of cancer. If I'm not in the lab or out playing billiards with friends you can usually find me in my workshop, or playing vintage video games.
Jakub Piątkowski I study biotechnology at the University of Warsaw (Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology). My research interests include RNA turnover in mitochondria and the evolution of organellar genomes. My B.Sc. thesis focused on a novel RNA-binding protein DMR1p in S. cerevisiae. Currently I’m working on my M.Sc. thesis, where I plan to include more detailed description of RNA-protein interactions in yeast mitochondrion. I also participate in the activities of the students’ societies: of Molecular and Synthetic Biology.
Marcin Ziemniak I am a student of chemistry and biotechnology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. My scientific interests include all aspects of bioorganic and theoretical chemistry connected with biopolymers, and some fields of biology involving synthetic and structural biology. Actually I am working in Division of Biophysics, UW and try to synthesize some new analogues of 5’ mRNA cap structures with superior biological properties. Moreover, I am about to finish my B. Sc thesis which is linked to chromatin remodeling. Besides my scientific work, I like listening to metal music and reading books especially science-fiction novels.
Anna Saffray I am a high school student and I have lived in Warsaw since 2003. Before that I lived in France near Paris . I always loved to do some experiments in my school , so when I started to work in the laboratory it was a great pleasure spending days with pipettes.
Radosław Stachowiak My adventure with biology and biotechnology dates back to 1995 when I became a biotechnology student at University of Warsaw. In the year 2000 I completed my MSc thesis and I guess I couldn’t stop there so I immidiately started PhD studies. Now I’m done with studying and my job is to take care of students and introduce them into science. Still, I like being involved in crazy projects so characteristic of Sudents’ Societies. The more crazy and incredible project the better. I guess this is the case so here I am!
Justyna Lesiak I am a student of Master Degree in Molecular Biology at the Univeristy of Warsaw, but I spent last semester at Vrije Universiteit of Brussels. Now I am working in the Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology and in the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology. I am not focused on one topic, and I always wanted to do lots of new and challenging things in the science area, however I must admit cancer researches are one of my very favourites, as well as human mitochondrial diseases. In my spare time I like to listen to classical and chamber music, read books, do irish dancing (I admire reels and hornpipes) and horseback riding.
Milena Bazlekowa Hi everyone ! My name is Milena and I study biotechnology at Warsaw University. Actually, I'm on my way to get a Bachelor's degree in molecular biology. I am very interested in application of biotechnology in medicine. I work on a project held by Department of Virology which investigates interactions between viruses and bacterias. My research is focused on comparison E.coli's and N. gonorrhoeae's VSR (very short patch repair) of DNA after bacteriophage's attack. I'm also a member of Students' Society of Genetics and Epigenetics. Actually, I'm on an internship at University of California in San Diego where I work on neural plasticity and nerve growth factors which can be used in a gene therapy concerning spinal cord injury repair. Apart from cloning, I love computer graphics, art and Mexican cuisine :). I like drawing, taking photographs and travelling.
