Testing the fluorescence of GFP in different pH in a microfluidic systemm by using flow cytometry[Ania O.,Cherry]
1. Enclosing GFP in different pH buffers into droplets in  a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion
2. Preparation of samples and examining them in flow cytometer
Data analysis with Cell Quest[Cherry]
