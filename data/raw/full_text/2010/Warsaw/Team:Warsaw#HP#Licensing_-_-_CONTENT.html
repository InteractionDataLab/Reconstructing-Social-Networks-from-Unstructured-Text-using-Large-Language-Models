	Currently licensing of community-created biological parts is very
similar to the situation on software scene before General Public
License (aka. GNU GPL) was created. 
</P><P lang="en-US" class="western" align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%">
	There are many great parts and devices created by the community
members and released freely to the community. In addition there is
very little awareness of keeping community-developed parts and their
derivatives free-as-in-freedom, meaning that the work is available
free of charge but can also be freely accessed and used by anyone to
create new parts that still remain in the Public Domain. 
</P><P lang="en-US" class="western" align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%">
	This can lead to the situation when work which was intended to
remain in the Public Domain would be patented as a part of some
project and the results of this project would not be returned to the
community. Moreover this allows the situation in which it's legal to
remove original author attribution information from parts containing
elements developed by others.</P><P lang="en-US" class="western" align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%">
	We recommend that all biological parts released to the community
should be licensed in a way that ensures that the original part as
well as all other parts using it can be obtained, used and modified
without any limitations. 
</P><P lang="en-US" class="western" align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%">
	We also recommend that single licensing scheme based on Creative
BioCommons licenses (see below), a Creative Commons derivative
applied to biological parts, should be adopted by synthetic biology
community. 
</P><P lang="en-US" class="western" align="JUSTIFY" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%">
	This will ensure that original author attribution information has to
be included when a new part based on the work of others is developed.
Moreover Creative BioCommons license is inherent, meaning that all
derivatives of the work (ie. BioBrick part) licensed under BioCommons
have to be licensed alike. In simple words this gives a legal
warranty that all You create with intention to share with others will
remain in the community. Additionally it ensures acknowledgment of
Your authorship.</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="BioCommons_in_plain_words">BioCommons in plain words </SPAN></H2><P>For all those who are not lawyers here is simple explanation of CreativeBiocommons features.
