Mutagenesis of MinC
Kuba
Directed mutagenesis was preformed on pSB-MinC in order to remove an additional PstI site. Two primers were used: MinCmutF (TAATTGCAGTCGCGCCGC) and MinCmutR (GTCGAAAACGCTTTGACCG). PCR was run with Yellow Pfu Polimerase (Eurex) in a standard reaction mix.
PCR conditions were as follows:
initial denaturation 95 oC; 3'
denaturation 95 oC; 30 s
annealing 51 oC; 30 s
elongation 72 oC<; 7'
x 30 cycles
72 oC; 10'
PCR product was digested with DpnI amd purified by agarose electrophoresis.
