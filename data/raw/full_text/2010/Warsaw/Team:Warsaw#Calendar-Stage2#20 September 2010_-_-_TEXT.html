Cloning MinC under RBS and a promoter
Kuba
pSB1A2 plasmids containig T7 promoter and B0032/B0034 RBS have been obtained from Michał. They were subsequently digested with SpeI and PstI. MinC-harboring plasmid was cut with XbaI and PstI. Following a 1,5 h digest, pSB1A2-pT7-B0032/34 and MinC were purified by gel electrophoresis with Gel-out kit (A&A biotechnology). Ligation was preformed over-night, with T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas) in 18 oC and standard reaction buffer
