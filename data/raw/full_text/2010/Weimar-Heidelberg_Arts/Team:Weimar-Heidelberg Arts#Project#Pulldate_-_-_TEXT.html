"Pulldate is great for the consumer, and could be even better for the producer, when you throw out your food before expired."
Christian Kieschnick
Product Description
'Pull date Box' can be used with any Tupperwar food storage system and gives you immediate access to information about what's in the box. The intensity of coloration on the 'Pull date Box' sticky-tape will show you how old its contents are. If it is completely red, you'd better throw it away if you want to protect your children!
Technical Description
To use the system, install our patented antigen-antibody sticky-tape on any of your Tupperwar storage system by pulling a piece through the little opening on the top of the box. Close it and keep it locked. Now the tape is contaminated with the contents of the box. The concentration of different bad smells will affect the intensity of coloration because of the specialized antibodies on the sticky-tape sheet.
