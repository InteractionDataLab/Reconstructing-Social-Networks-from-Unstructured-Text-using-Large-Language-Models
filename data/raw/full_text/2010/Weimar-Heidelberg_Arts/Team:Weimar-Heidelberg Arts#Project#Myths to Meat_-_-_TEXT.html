"While we have to eat one animal at the time, we could be free to taste the world. 'La haute cuisine des genes' is cooking guided by imagination. Meat your wish meal. Touch something - mythical with your tounge. Compose your meat and and spice it with some genes of flavor. genetic cooking means whidening our foodchain and opening a new huntingfield for the chef of the 21st century. "
Bastian Bügler
