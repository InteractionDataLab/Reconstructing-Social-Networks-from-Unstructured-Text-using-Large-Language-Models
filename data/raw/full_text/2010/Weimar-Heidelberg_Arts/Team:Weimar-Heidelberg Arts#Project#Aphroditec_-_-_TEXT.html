"It's the old story of controlling love – the own feelings and the feelings of the others. Fall in love and be loved – without any doubts! It is the deliverance of freedom and a relieve of uncertainty and pain. But for which price? AphrodiTec points on the actual discussion and central question of the contemporary individual: The right measure of self-determination and heteronomy. "
Mila Burghardt
