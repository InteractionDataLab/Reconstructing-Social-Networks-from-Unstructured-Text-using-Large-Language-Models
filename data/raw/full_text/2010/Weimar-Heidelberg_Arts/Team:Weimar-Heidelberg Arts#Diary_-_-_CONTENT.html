After settling on the name &quot;Super Cell&quot; for our Synthetic Biology Supermarket we are working on products and details of the webshop. Points of discussion are the unification of the products and a guideline defining the modus operandi for our products in generell, something every product in the shop has to pass. Mila works on a visualization on BactoSafe - a individualized security system. We are tinkering on an idea which combines cuisine and perfumery - a fantasm of synthetically enhanced farts. Also we´re brooding on the visual realization of the DNA-Pet and the Yoga-Blob. late night-thoughts: Talking about the visualizations of Christian. Great to see a first image and start getting deeper into it. Thoughts of making it more organic and less industrial. So naturally the owner could be a farmer, with special interests. As the real shop would get more important this way, our webshop would transform into something else - more a representation, a platform, a guideline, an explanation to see the farm/shop , the whole experience. Less mass products - more individual, nicheproducts, small products.

            </DIV></DIV><DIV class="diary-report"><P>Morning meeting with Patrick, web-design. He showes us his first draft for the page. We find it´s a bit harsh to start with the products on the first page. A intruduction needs to be made- with a static image, some explaning words or another media -&gt; VIDEO. Main part will be a slide-show allowing the user to go through the different products of a category quickly. The feature of the slide-show will enable us to put the products in an order that makes sense to us and leaves the static view on only one product but gives an impression of a sortiment, a line, a social construct. By clicking onto the product in the slide you will come to the detailed product site. Video may be working in the slide-show as well, maybe - will be checked… The brainstorming of the meeting with the Heidelbergians in July is finally packed in a textfile - a pool for future ideas or extensions of already existing ones.

Talking about the different products everybody is working on individually and bringing them together by presenting them in an order that makes sense in a product-line/category. First draft of an bacterial fridge and on BactoSafe, a biological security system are presented. Mila explained her idea of the balcony garden and the way she wants to create a diversity between organic, vegan and synthetic manipulated lifestyles. As we were talking about vegetables we touched trecking-veggies &gt; super-fast growing vegetables for tracking and camping enabling you to grow breakfgast while sleeping. We thought of cancer-manipulated veggies and have to research if that makes any sense. For the product &quot;Odor Cuisine&quot; we kind of agreed to show it in the form of a cookbook, containing also pictures of methodes and new applications concerning olfactory output :) . The Drug delivery system, an iGEM project from Emperial college in 2009 could be very helpful to place the manipulated e-coli bacs. Last two topics were Baby´s best by mila , a product which is already pretty clear , but needs some decisions on the visualization now.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="diary-entry clearfix" id="aug_14"><DIV class="specs"><DIV class="date">           August 14th

            </DIV></DIV><DIV class="diary-report"><P>After one weekend full of preparations, together with our visiting creative directors Laura and Philipp from Heidelberg, the long-awaited shooting for 'recobrain' could get started.

The production team already met early in the morning to rework their masterplan for the day: take photos and a short commercial expressing their recobrain ideas! Shortly after the team declared to begin with the shooting at our workspace in Weimar, because the pre-production hasn´t been over-detailed but enough to start right away.

After finishing the shooting at the first three locations: a toilet(sounds weird but totally makes sense), a craftsman-room and a outdoorshot in the park; our frisky and amused team started to record the important injection main-scene in our little studio. Afterwards the shooting migrated to another location: a flat or more specific...the couch and the kitchen sink of it. To get ahead after a long break in the afternoon, everybody headed to the fitnessstudio - the official final location. Late at 11pm the last photo and film-take was made(hooray!), followed by an all night edit, photoshop, after effect session of our exhausted team members!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="diary-entry clearfix" id="oct_12"><DIV class="specs"><DIV class="date">

Packed with a big bag full of photographic impressions on business outfits, cocktail dresses, bridal gowns and prices the two girls finnaly returned to present their design-proposals via power-point on our early afternoon team meeting. After balancing our prospects with (more or less) the whole group, we regrettably decided not to show of in a scary artistic mirror ball suit while our presentation in Boston.

Furthermore the design and structure of our iGEM-wiki got discussed with the group once more.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="diary-entry clearfix" id="oct_13"><DIV class="specs"><DIV class="date">
