Perfect Body
"PERFECT BODY" is a product that goes just one or two steps further than our every day life now referring to social tendencies concerning the obsession of beauty and the availability of body (and woman).  I guess – if "PERFECT BODY" as a product comes up on the market a lot of people (especially girls in their puberty) would buy and use it. As they than loose their own body it would change their personal life – and with this a whole generation, influencing the society itself.  If we can buy body parts (things) that adhere in a minute on my own body, that become my own body - where is than the boarder between subject and object?  How will this change subjectivity and the meaning of individualism?

AphrodiTec
Its the old story of controlling love – the own feelings and the feelings of the others. Fall in love and be loved – without any doubts! It is the deliverance of the freedom and a relieve of uncertainness and pain. But for which price? AphrodiTec points on the actual discussion and central question of the contemporary individual: the right measure of self-determination and heteronomy.

Balcony Menu
What is 'bio'? A lot of people prefer products that are labeled with 'bio' – without asking themselves how 'bio' it really is. Is the 'bio' tomato that grew 800 kilometers away really 'better' than the 'normal' tomato that grew in the next village?  Balcony Menu takes this paradox to extremes. Food that I nurture on my balcony has to be 100 % 'bio', it makes a good conscious and a feeling of safety – but which process has the plant gone through until it was in this state to sustain various fruits and vegetables?  And still – wouldn't it be great to have that product at home? This product doesn't aim a judgement but wants to stimulate the awareness of what we eat and our perception of 'bio'.

BactoSafe
People are in fear about their properties, their families, their lives. Media and some politicians stoke those fears and produce an atmosphere that brings people to switch the priorities from 'freedom' to 'safety'. And this might have a high price. How do we want to punish people for misbehavior, what would come up if everyone has the possibility to use bacteria and virus for tracing e.g. intruders. Which other secondary effect would an area-wide DNA database have, for example on the employment market. How far are we really willing to go to protect our 'safety'?

Babys Best Night Care
Its perfect, its helping, its useful. And its a cruel thing to use, if we focus for example on "harmonizing substance that guides your child to pleasant and deep dreams".  It confronts us with the topic of egoism, covered with the cloak of care and broaches with this the issue of  advertising products in general.

Sasha
Synbio products are living and still machines. "Sasha" picks the 'technology as a sociotechnical system' and communication in general out as the central themes. Using the example of a learning sex toy this product deals with the interaction of human and machine, but at the same time picking up our way of (not) communicating from human to human.

Ko*ko*ro*mo
With the beginning of the chemical prime-age in the early 19th century organics with their natural abilities have gotten replaced by new revolutionary synthetical substances as an basic material for almost everthing. As a cause of this trend even popular plants with former medical backround sank into oblivion with a bad reputation as unaesthetical weeds.  Although we know that even the most efficient chemical products can cause harmful side-effects on our bodys,  our association with chemicals and plants changed very slowly since today. Thats why Ko*ko*ro*mo, the green synbio product, likes to approach as a intermediator between modern human needs and a plants rights to exists, via demonstrating new alternatives for a greener and more sustainable lifestyle in coexistance with plants. Such like moss.
