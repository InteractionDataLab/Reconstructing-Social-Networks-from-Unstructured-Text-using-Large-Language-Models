usage of E. chromi principle (pigmented E. coli cells)
as a colorful crowd
plasmids available in iGEM Spring 2010 DNA Distribution (see table 1)
testing of a synthetic E.coli predator-prey system ( Song et al., 2009 ), ( Ballagaddé et al., 2008 )
for final assault on the swarming plate and under the microscope
kindly provided by R. Smith (see table 2)
wildtype E. coli
for the game-kit

transformation of TOP10 cells with plasmids (see table 1) out of the registry following standard recommendations
over-night growth on selective LB agar plates (10 g Tryptone, 5 g Yeast extract, 10 g NaCl and 15 g Agar ad 1 L ddH2O + required antibiotics)

inoculation of day cultures with colonies from the previous day
in 5 mL LB + required antibiotic
preparation of TB soft agar plates (10 g Tryptone, 5 g NaCl and 3 g Agar ad 1 L ddH2O + required antibiotics swarm plates) for swarming
inoculation by carefully pipetting 3 μL of liquid culture into the solidified agar
incubation of swarm plates at room temperature for 20 h
sufficient humidity was ensured by petri dishes filled with water
a photo was taken (by Canon EOS 5D Mark II) every 30 sec. for 6 h
inoculation of over-night cultures from the day cultures
02/10/2010
preparation and conduction of microscopy experiments with predator-prey system following liquid-phase protocols
snapshots were taken every second for one minute at beginning and at the very end of the experiments
time-lapse took 3 h with a picture each 20 seconds using given filters for GFPuv and mCherry
