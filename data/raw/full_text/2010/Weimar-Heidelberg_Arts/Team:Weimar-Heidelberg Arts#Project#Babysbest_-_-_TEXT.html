"Its perfect, its helping, its useful. And its a cruel thing to use, if we focus for example on “harmonizing substance that guides your child to pleasant and deep dreams”.  It confronts us with the topic of egoism, covered with the cloak of care and broaches with this the issue of  advertising products in general."
Mila Burghardt
Product Description
Because a happy baby makes parents happy!
Baby's Best Night Care is a special brand of diapers reacting to the child's needs with three patented mechanisms to satisfy your child all night long!
Sensor 1: checks your child's nutrition supply. If any nutrient content falls below the desired rate, 'Baby's Best Night Care' dispenses the necessary nutrients which will be absorbed through baby's skin.
Sensor 2: examines movement activity. If the child is having restless dreams or is about to wake up, 'Baby's Best Night Care' dispenses a harmonizing substance that guides your child to pleasant and deep dreams.
Sensor 3: reacts to the child's excretion. The new, active formula transforms urine and faeces into a cotton-like inlay and results in a cosy, warm and dry feeling.
Baby's Best Night Care – Sleep well!
Technical Description
This product is based on three integrated bacteria strains which are activated by an over or under-supply of special substances, sensed and processed by a bacterial interface connected to the baby's skin or the physical activity of the child. 100% biodegradable.
