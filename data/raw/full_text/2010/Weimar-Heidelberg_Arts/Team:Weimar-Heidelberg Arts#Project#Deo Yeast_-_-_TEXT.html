"It`s a real alternative to pertrochemical deodorants. Be independent and safe harmful industrial substances."
Christian Kieschnick
Product Description
The user can breed their own yeast with specific characteristics, thus creating their own specific perfume. The kind of scent that can be produced is unlimited, and can easily be adapted to the consumer's requirements. The charger is used to cultivate the yeast, then to sporulate it and fill it into the deodorant container. By pressing the symmetric buttons on the top of the deodorant's cap, two substrates are brought together in a separate upper chamber. This can sporulates the yeast and applies it to the skin. The growing medium consists of a special sugar, which itself can be produced by the end-user.
Technical Description
We genetically modified normal bakers yeast and integrated a complex set of order- producing and cleansing genes. Thereby we enabled the yeast produce substances for removing bad-smelling skin bacteria and to give yourself the perfect smell!
