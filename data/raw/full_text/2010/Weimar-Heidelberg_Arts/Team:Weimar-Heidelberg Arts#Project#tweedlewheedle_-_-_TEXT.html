"Shiny bright eyes, auroral skin, strong hair! Happiness can turn a human into a different person. Also animals, just as well as their products, can benefit from feeling happy. Only plants are not believed to be happy at all. Because they have no facial expression, no brain and cannot speak. Even though it is already proven that harmful influences (pesticides and pests) can make a plant feel unhappy, stressed and forced to release substances in order to defend itself. That’s why we need to make our plants happy at first, if we like to have healthy plants producing healthy substances for our body and soul! Tweedlewheedle tries to follow this 'one hand washes the other'-agenda, while resolving the typical human belief in symptomatic treatment with a new effective detection method for stress causes, connecting plants and humans with each other!"

Product Description
Pull out your green thumb and smell the difference! With 'Tweedlewheedle', Treehugger's new plant translator plug, the most essential needs and worries of almost every plant can be exposed with only a single sniff. Matched to your own DNA and your body conditions, the 'Tweedlewheedle' nose-plugs can easily be attached to your nose cartilage with your fingertip. No technical knowledge is needed. Do not swallow! Main ingredients are tobacco and mimosa, which can cause diarrhea and short-term intoxication.
'Tweedlewheedle' is a living companion that works on its own. 'Tweedlewheedle' combines the genetic characteristics of super-sensitive mimosa, highly efficient tobacco, and cleverly treated human neurons. The capital messenger substances of a plant are mapped and delivered to your brain via tiny electronic impulses. Do not swallow! Main ingredients are tobacco and mimosa, which can cause diarrhea and short-term intoxication.

Technical Description
kokoromo', our all-in-one product, contains only the best mossy abilities. For this purpose, 'kokoromo' is engineered out of four special moss species in our synbio labs via complex knock-out treatments. This allows us to first target the particular skills required from the moss genes and to derive them from their genetical modules, so that a new moss type can be assembled in the final stage and synthesized by our treehugger-scientists.
