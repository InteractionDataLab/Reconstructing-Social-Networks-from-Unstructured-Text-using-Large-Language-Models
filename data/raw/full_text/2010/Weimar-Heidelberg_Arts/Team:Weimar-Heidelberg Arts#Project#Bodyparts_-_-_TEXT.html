"PERFECT BODY is a product that goes just one or two steps further than our every day life now referring to social tendencies concerning the obsession of beauty and the availability of body (and woman).  I guess – if PERFECT BODY as a product comes up on the market a lot of people (especially girls in their puberty) would buy and use it. As they than loose their own body it would change their personal life – and with this a whole generation, influencing the society itself.  If we can buy body parts (things) that adhere in a minute on my own body, that become my own body - where is than the boarder between subject and object?  How will this change subjectivity and the meaning of individualism?"
