"Synbio products are living and still machines. “Sasha” picks the 'technology as a sociotechnical system' and communication in general out as the central themes. Using the example of a learning sex toy this product deals with the interaction of human and machine, but at the same time picking up our way of (not) communicating from human to human."
Mila Burghardt
Product Description
'Sasha' is a sensual communication tool for men and women. It helps you understand your needs and communicates them to your partner.
While in the first sessions it learns from you, the longer and more often you use 'Sasha', it will begin guiding you, taking the lead to bring you to new sensual horizons. 'Sasha' can be used for massage and caressing, but 'Sasha' may also be used as an intelligent sex toy for men and women and constantly collects data about your hormone level whilst satisfying your physical desires.
The exclusively-designed docking-station charges 'Sasha' and stores the data of your session to improve an on-going evaluation of your likes and dislikes. Thereby 'Sasha' learns and improves according to your interests, becoming more accurate with increased use. This guarantees maximum fun or relaxation with 'Sasha'.
When not in use 'Sasha' doesn’t resemble a sex toy at all. Placed in the base it becomes a beautiful moving sculpture, morphing into tasteful shapes that please the eye. 'Sasha' serves as a “sexual advisor” helping to improve the sex life in your relationship.
This tool is a must-have for people who want both discrete aesthetics and maximum enjoyment.
Technical Description
'Sasha' is available in several looks. It consists of synthetic skin filled with sensory cell mass and muscle strands controlled by an integrated neural network. 'Sasha' is stored in a glass base filled with appended nourishing solution which should be refreshed every third day
