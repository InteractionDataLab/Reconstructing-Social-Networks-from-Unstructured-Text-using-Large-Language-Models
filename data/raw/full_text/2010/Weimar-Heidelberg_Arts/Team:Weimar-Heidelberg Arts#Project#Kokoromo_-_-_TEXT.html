"Since the chemical prime-age in the early 19th century most organic substances employed in medicine, food production, as constructional material or as fuel got replaced by new synthetic ones. As a result even former popular plants with a medical, societal or industrial backround sank into oblivion with a bad reputation as unaesthetical weeds. Our association with chemicals and plants has not changed since, although we know today that chemical products may cause harmful side-effects as cancer.  That is why kokoromo, as a green project, not only presents itself as a buyable product, but also as a intermediator between a modern human's needs and a plants right to exist. Kokoromo demonstrates an alternative for a greener and more sustainable lifestyle in coexistance with plants."

Product Description
Regulate hygienic problems in just the twinkle of an eye - with 'kokoromo', the new indoor vegetation based on organic wild type mosses!
This revolutionary new product combines only the best moss abilities: crush resistance, fast growth, moisture absorption and disinfection. 'kokoromo' is a reliable partner for every occasion in your home, be it as an indicator for fungi, as a dryer for wet walls or a cleaner to reduce allergic illnesses.
The 'kokoromo' product line moreover includes a various range of applications for the simple attachment to different constructional material, for example the 'kokoromo' spongy adhesive spray and 'kokoromo' wall-plaster spore powder. A perfect organic alternative to expensive carpets and wallpapers!
Technical Description
kokoromo', our all-in-one product, contains only the best mossy abilities. For this purpose, 'kokoromo' is engineered out of four special moss species in our synbio labs via complex knock-out treatments. This allows us to first target the particular skills required from the moss genes and to derive them from their genetical modules, so that a new moss type can be assembled in the final stage and synthesized by our treehugger-scientists.
