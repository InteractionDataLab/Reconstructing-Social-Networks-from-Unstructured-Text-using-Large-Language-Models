"What is 'bio'? A lot of people prefer products that are labeled with 'bio' – without asking themselves how 'bio' it really is. Is the 'bio' tomato that grew 800 kilometers away really 'better' than the 'normal' tomato that grew in the next village?  Balcony Menu takes this paradox to extremes. Food that I nurture on my balcony has to be 100 % 'bio', it makes a good conscious and a feeling of safety – but which process has the plant gone through until it was in this state to sustain various fruits and vegetables?  And still – wouldn't it be great to have that product at home? This product doesn't aim a judgement but wants to stimulate the awareness of what we eat and our perception of 'bio'."

Product Description
One plant for it all!
A high quality selection of various vegetables, fruits and herbs that grow on one plant. It provides everything that is needed for a delicious three-course meal composed by star chef Anton Gonzo. His list of ingredients form the basis for the plants, which are then designed by agricultural and nutritional scientists together with SynBio engineers. After growing, the plant is harvested in one piece and provides you with all the organic ingredients needed for starter, main course and dessert.
Balcony Menu is available in three tantalizing themes: “Provencal”; “Nordic Nights” and “Italian Dreams” and may be ordered in three different sizes: single, romantic (2 people) and family (4 or more people).
Technical instructions:
1 plant the balcony menu in a common flower box.
2 water it every second day.
3 harvest it after approximately three weeks and enjoy your meal!
"Provencal" starter: olives, capers, oil, herbs main course: eggplant, tomato, thyme, rosemary, onion, potato dessert: apricot, lavender, honey-blossom
"Nordic Nights" starter: cucumber, horseradish, chives main course: peas, pepper, potato, carrots, leek dessert: elderflower, apple, honey-blossom

Technical Description
Balcony Menu is based on an embryonic manipulation method in which the stem cells of different plants have been made compatible with each other. Cellular fusion allows the growth of tissues from different species on one-and-the-same host plant.
