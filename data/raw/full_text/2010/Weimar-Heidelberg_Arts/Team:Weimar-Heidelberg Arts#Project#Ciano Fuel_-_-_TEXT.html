"The use of Cyano Fuel could change our relation to basic materials from an industrial matter into a personal one."
Christian Kieschnick
Product Description
Do you have lakes near your home that are choked green with algal bloom? If so, you need Cyano Fuel Pump!  Our product not only allows you to control ugly and poisonous contamination by algae and cyanobacteria, it also converts these green pests into fuel. Based on natural jellyfish technologies, Cyano Fuel Pump is a green way of dealing with algal bloom.
Technical Description
The technology of this product is based on the symbiotic relationship seen between some species of jellyfish and algae. We conceived the product as containing millions of spinning cells that filter the algae from the water, trapping them and converting their photosynthesized sugars into fuel.
