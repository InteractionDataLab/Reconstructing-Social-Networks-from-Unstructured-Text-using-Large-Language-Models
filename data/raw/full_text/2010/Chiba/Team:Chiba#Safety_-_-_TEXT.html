Safety issue
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues?
- Not at all. All our circuits are made of genetic regulators and reporters (fluorescent proteins).
Our project goal -double click system- is designed to improve the safety in operating modified organisms.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
- Our biobricks are composed of gene regulators, RNA polymerase, hybrid promoters, and fluorescent proteins only. None of them (and the combination of those parts/ devices) could raise the safety issue. Thus, we are working on the super-safe side of Synthetic Biology!
3.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
- Yes. Our institution has the committee to deal with all the safety issues, which occur in bioengineering and we have got the permission of our project.
4.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and -systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
- Definitely, safety issues in iGEM is very important and false input should be eliminated, so safty system like our project would quite useful.
