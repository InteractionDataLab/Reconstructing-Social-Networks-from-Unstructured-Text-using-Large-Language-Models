Abstract
LuxR is an AHL-dependent activator.LuxR-AHL complex bind lux box,a 20-bp sequence and activate transcription.  However the lux box is inserted between -35 and -10 and LuxR functions as LuxR-AHL inverter (Plux inv) .The Plux inv was resistered in Biobrick number R0061.We've constructed Plux inv-GFP combinig R0061and E0240 and characterized about it.
Experiments
1.Preparing Plux inv-GFP
Plasmid:R0061 and E0240
Strain:XL10-G
protocol
Preparing process of Plux inv-GFP  is shown in Fig. 1.We transformed preparing Plux inv-GFP in XL10-G and confirmed the expression GFP Fluorescence.The sequence is also conformed.

2.Characterization Plux inv-GFP
Plasmid:Plux inv-GFP and Plac-LuxR (LuxR constitutive generator)
strain:DH10B
protocol
We cotransformded Plux inv-GFP and LuxR Plac-LuxR in DH10B. 1,LBL incubation for12 h at 37゜C.
Results
We confirmed GFP Fluorescence both AHL+ and -sample.
