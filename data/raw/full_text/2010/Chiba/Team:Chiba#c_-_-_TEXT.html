It is often said:  GREAT COMPANIES START WITH GREAT PEOPLE...
"... I know this much:  if we get the right people on the bus, the right people in the right seats..., then we'll figure out how to take it someplace great."
Jim Collins, Author of Good to Great
As Peter Drucker stated;  "There are three kinds of companies today:
Those who make it happen;
Those who watch it happen;
Those who wonder what happened."
Brooke Chase Associates, Inc. "Makes it Happen."  A testament to our success is, 94% of our business comes from long-term, repeat, and satisfied clients.  While there are many theories surrounding our achievement, the truth lies in our careful cultivation of client relationships and our continued effort to provide quality service and outstanding performance.
