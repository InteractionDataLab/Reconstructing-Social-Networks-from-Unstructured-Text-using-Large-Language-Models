Public Opinion of Synthetic Biology
The data indicated that overall individuals did not have a very deep understanding of synthetic biology. The data also showed that most individuals were in favor of synthetic biology being used with cleaning the environment, developing a bio-fuel cell, and uses in the medical field. However in question 8 and 15, the data indicated that people felt as though there are risks which are associated with using synthetic biology, and that they would not like to eat genetically altered food.
