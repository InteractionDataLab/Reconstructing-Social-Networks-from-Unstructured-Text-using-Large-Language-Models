Characterized BioBricks
Divergent promoters from Gifsy1 phage and Gifsy1 repressor GogR
BBa_K374008
This part contains the promoters: pRGifsy1 and pRMGifsy1. Downstream of the pRMGifsy1 promoter is the repressor gogR. gogR binds to the operator regions located between the two divergent promoters and is predicted to act both as an activator of the pRMGifsy1 and a repressor of the pRGifsy1.
This regulatory biobrick can be used in a biological circuit. Other BioBricks can be inserted downstream of the pR promoter, however, no expression will be allowed because of the GogR repressor. BBa_K374008 can be combined with BBa_K374010 hence allowing expression of your inserted BioBrick.
For more information look here or in parts-registry, BBa_K374008
Divergent promoters from Gifsy2 phage and Gifsy2 repressor GtgR
BBa_K374009
This part contains the promoters: pRGifsy2 and pRMGifsy2. Downstream of the pRMGifsy2 promoter is the repressor gtgR. gtgR binds to the operator regions located between the two divergent promoters and is predicted to act both as an activator of the pRMGifsy2 and a repressor of the pRGifsy2.
This regulatory biobrick can be used in a biological circuit. Other BioBricks can be inserted downstream of the pR promoter, however, no expression will be allowed because of the GtgR repressor. BBa_K374009 can be combined with XXX hence allowing expression of your inserted BioBrick.

N anti-terminator gene from Lambda phage
BBa_K374006
In lambda bacteriophage, gene expression is regulated by the suppression of transcription termination (antitermination) which is mediated by the lambda N protein that interacts with the nut site which is a cis-acting element. This part contains the lambda N gene which will suppress transcription termination downstream of  the nutR site.
This regulatory biobrick can be used in a biological circuit. Together with BBa_K374005 , they will promote anti-termination.
