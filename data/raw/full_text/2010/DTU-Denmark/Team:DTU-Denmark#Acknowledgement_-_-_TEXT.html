Acknowledgements and Contributions
We would like to thank everybody who has helped and assisted us in the process of making this project a reality!
The organization of our team is based on the bottom-up approach, and from day one we have been very self-sufficient, in doing fundraising, laboratory work, trouble shooting, time management and all other practical details ourselves. We have developed the project idea by ourselves and we would like to thank our supervisors for their helpful inputs and suggestions to our experimental design along the way.
Administrative support
The Head of Department at DTU Systems Biology Ole Filtenborg and Deputy Head at DTU Systems Biology Steen Heilmann have supported us with laboratory space, money and their unwavering faith in our team and project idea.
Supervisors
We would like to thank them for getting our group together, their continuous feedback and their patience. They took a lot of time out of their busy schedules for having really interesting discussions with us about experimental, theoretical and data analysis questions during the entire project. Thereby we got the chance to learn a lot from very different scientific fields!
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to:
associate professor Chris Workman, who shared his immense knowledge about modeling, data analysis and BioLector with us.
associate professor Mogens Kilstrup, who always enjoyed discussing results, experimental strategies and theoretical issues.
professor Peter Ruhdal Jensen, who supported the development of our iGEM Synthetic Promoter Libary.
post.doc Sebastien Lemire, who shared his enormous knowledge about phage regulation with us and his huge laboratory experience.
Laboratory and technical support
A lot of people contributed to our project by helping us with practical issues regarding laboratory equipment and technical standards.
We would like to thank:
PhD student Hassan Hartman for his invaluable experimental advice and practical help.
master student Jacopo Martini and PhD student Emmanouil Papadakis for introducing us to GFP measurements with the BioLector.
assistant professor Flemming G. Hansen for his expertise in fluorescent proteins.
assistant professor Sergio Rossell for advice on the modeling of our system.
laboratory assistant Bjarne Albrektsen for his practical help in the laboratory.
Other supporters
last years DTU iGEM team for all their advice and help that we received during the entire process.
