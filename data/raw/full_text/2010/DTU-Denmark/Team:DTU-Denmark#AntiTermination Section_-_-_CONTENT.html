In lambda bacteriophage, gene expression is regulated by the suppression of transcription termination which is mediated by the lambda N protein that interacts with the nut site. We have constructed several test plasmids with different terminator strength and references. These plasmids are presented in the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/AntiTermination_Section#Construction">Construction of Parts</A> section. The aim of the characterization experiments has been to test:
<UL><LI>If it was possible to trigger the feedback mechanisms of the N protein by varying promoter strengths, it would be possible to observe increased read through of the terminator.</LI><LI>If the N-mechanisms can be triggered by induction of N from a seperate inducible plasmid.</LI></UL></P><FONT color="#990000" face="arial" size="5"><B>Characterization</B></FONT>

In order to test the funcionality of the antiterminator system the following 6 plasmids were constructed. The test plasmids pAT12-16 and the induction plasmid pAT01 are presented in the figures below.

Next there is a nutR followed by a terminator site, which is different for each of the plasmids. pAT14 and pAT15 contain a single terminator site, namely BBa_B0011 (from pAT09) and BBa_B1003 (from pAT10) respectively, while pAT13 contain both (pAT11). Downstream of the terminator site, there is the N gene followed by RBS and RFP (from pAT02) present in each of the three constructs. </P></CAPTION></TABLE><TABLE class="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/9/94/Malthe3_E_pAT16.png" align="center"><CAPTION align="bottom"><P align="justify"><B>Figure 3: pAT16</B>: Insert´s organisation in plasmid pAT16 with pSB2K3 as the backbone.

</P></CAPTION></TABLE><P align="justify">
As described in the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/AntiTermination_Section#Construction">Construction of Parts</A>, several promoters of different strengths have been introduced into the final constructs pAT12-pAT16, all containing GFP and RFP reporters. Together these promoters constitute Synthetic Promoter Library (SPL). Transcription through the terminator site results in the expression of the N antiterminator. If enough N protein is produced, the antitermination is mediated. Our system enables us to measure the promoter strength by measuring the amount of GFP produced. At the same time the amount of transcription past the promoter can be estimated by measuring the amount of RFP produced. This is one of the strategies for the characterization of our final constructs. For a more detailed explanation see the section on <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/SPL_Section#Characterization">Synthetic Promoter Library</A> (SPL).
</P><P align="justify">
Strains containing pAT12-16 have also been transformed with pAT01, containing pBAD and ARAC promoters upstream of lambda N-gene with its natural RBS. This has been done in order to induce expression of N protein. Supplement of bacterial cultures containing these plasmids with arabinose enhances the expression of the lambda N-gene and therefore increases the production of the N protein. As a consequence, the N produced in pAT12-16 can be measured and compared. Based on that, we have also tried to characterize our system by testing whether or not it is possible to trigger N-mediated antitermination by coupling the N protein to the pBAD promoter.

The 5 test plasmids were transformed into <I>E. coli</I> Xl1-blue, with the <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/SPL_Section">SPL</A> in front of the constructs to give a large range of expressions. The first series of test strains are called series A. Isolated colonies from this transformation (series A) were again transformed with the inducible pAT01 plasmid containing pBAD and ARAC promoters upstream of lambda N-gene with its natural RBS to give the test series N.

From the plates we further counted the numbers of strong and weak promoters and investigated if the positive feedback mechanism was triggered. Colonies from construct B, with the strong B0015 terminator and from C with the strong single terminator B0011, it was possible to see a clear termination effect in most of the colonies. Further a few colonies with very strong green florescence also had medium to strong red fluorescence. This is an indication on that the positive feedback mechanism from the N protein works.

We did a series of restreaks of the successful series A transformations described above. These were used in the Biolector experiments. We used fluorescent microscopy to confirm the BioLector results and the construct's stability.

The efficiency rate was drastically decreased, as was the consistency regarding terminator efficiency. Most of the colonies that had undetectable levels of GFP appeared to gain a mutation that prevented expression of functional GFP, but when isolated, all except for two colonies from each construct showed detectable levels. Only one colony (B10) from the selected and restreaked colonies of the B and C constructs expressed trigger mechanisms and expressed RFP, see Table 4.

Unfortunately only 4 of the 10 selected colonies run in the BioLector showed GFP expression when subsequently examined in the fluorescent microscope, and none of them had RFP expression. This is unfortunately consistent with the data achieved from the actual BioLector run.

Overnight cultures were run in the BioLector and induced with arabinose after approx. 4 hours to induce N protein expression.

At the same time the overnight cultures were diluted and new overnight cultures were made with a reference and also induced with arabinose to test if a difference in the RFP expression could be seen.  None of the cultures expressed RFP. Data not shown. It was not possible to verify the trigger or inducible mechanism from this experiment. Through visual inspection, it appeared clear that the N induced strains appeared to be lysing.

In order to construct our biobricks, we used a set of forward and reverse primers to amplify a region of interest by using PCR. The fragments created by PCR amplification were <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/Lab_protocols#PCR_purification">purified</A> using a PCR clean-up kit. The amplicon and the linearized backbone plasmid pSB1C3 (containing a chroramphenicol resistance marker) were <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/Lab_protocols#Restriction_Digestion">digested</A>, resulting in sticky ends. This was achieved either by the standard assembly or the three-way ligation approach (3A assembly). Both the digested PCR product and the digested plasmid were run on a gel in order to estimate DNA concentration. T4 ligase was used for <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/Lab_protocols#Ligations">ligation</A> with a 5:1 ratio of insert to backbone. After the ligation, the plasmid was <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/Lab_protocols#Transformation ">transformed </A> into electrocompetent DH5<SUB>α</SUB><I>E. coli</I> cells. After an hour of recovery in LB medium at 37 °C, the cells were plated on LB plates containing chloramphenicol (Cam) and left overnight. Several colonies from the plates were then selected and restreaked on LB+Cam plates in order to assure pure colonies. Overnight cultures of the transformants were made by taking one colony from each restreak and inoculating it in LB+Cam at 37 °C over night. <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/Lab_protocols#Plasmid_purifcation">Minipreps</A> were made from the overnight cultures and a verification PCR was run on these in order to make sure that the plasmid had the expected insert.</P><H3>Construction of BioBrick K374005</H3><P align="justify">This part contains the lambda nutR site, inserted into the backbone plasmid pSB1C3.

Content and information pertaining to the construction of our constructs are listed below.
</P><P align="justify"><B>pATN, pAT05</B>
Natural Lambda N-gene (encoding the N protein) and nutR have been inserted into the backbone plasmid pSB1C3 to construct pATN and pAT05 respectively. These parts have been submitted to the parts registry. 
</P><P align="justify"><B>pAT02</B>
pAT02 containing RFP reporter, has been constructed by inserting K374011 (lambda N-gene with its natural RBS), followed by BBa_B0034 (RBS) and BBa_E1010 (RFP) into pSB1C3. This part has also been submitted to the parts registry.
</P><P align="justify"><B>pAT03</B>pAT03 has been constructed by inserting RBS site BBa_B0034 and K374012 (FACS optimised GFP) into the recipient plasmid pSB1C3. 
</P><P align="justify"><B>pAT04, pAT06, pAT07</B>pAT05 with the lambda nutR insert has been used to construct pAT06, pAT07 and pAT04, also containing different terminator sites. Plasmids pAT06 and pAT07 contain a single terminator site, but with different terminator strengths. Thus, pAT06 contains BBa_B0011 with medium terminator strength, while pAT07 contains BBa_B1003, which is a strong terminator site. Plasmid pAT04 contains both BBa_B0011 and BBa_B1003. These plasmids have been constructed in order to test termination efficiency and have also been submitted to the parts registry.
</P><P align="justify"><B>pAT08, pAT09, pAT10 and pAT11</B>plasmids pAT05, pAT06, pAT07 and pAT04 have been used along with pAT03 to construct pAT08, pAT09, pAT10 and pAT11 respectively. pAT08-pAT11 contain a GFP reporter that is important for the construction of pAT12-15.
</P><P align="justify"><B>pAT12, pAT13, pAT15</B>
pAT08 has been used to construct pAT12, pAT09 to construct pAT014, pAT10 to construct pAT15 and pAT11 has been used to construct pAT13. All of these new constructs also contain pAT02. The organisation of inserts in plasmid pAT12 is shown in figure 1, while the organisation of inserts in plasmids pAT13-15 is presented in figure 2. 
</P><P align="justify"><B>pAT16</B>
pAT16 has been constructed by inserting pAT10 and BBa_I13507 into pSB2K3 backbone. The insert organisation of pAT16 is shown in figure 3.
