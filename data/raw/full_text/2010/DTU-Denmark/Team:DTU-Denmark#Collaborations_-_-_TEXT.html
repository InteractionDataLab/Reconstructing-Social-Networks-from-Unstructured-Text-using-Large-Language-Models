Collaborations
During the project we helped many other teams by answering their questionnaires and interview requests. We worked closely together  with the SDU iGEM team from the University of Southern Denmark with regard to technical issues, give feedback on each others poster and presentation. In order to be able to organize this we arranged the Scandinavian iGEM pre-conference, where all teams from the Scandinavian countries were invited.
Scandinavian iGEM pre-conference
The first Scandinavian iGEM pre-conference was held the 9th October here at DTU.  The purpose of this conference was to present the status of our work to each other, have a practice session for the presentations and show a first draft of the poster to each other. Based on this we had a discussion session, where we talked about our experiences, our difficulties and challenges with the project, but we also discussed what is needed to obtain good results.
Unfortunately the Swedish teams resigned before the conference, so only the Danish teams were participating.  We had a constructive day that ended in a dinner and socializing before we went home with new energy and inspiration for our projects.
Both teams would like to thank the Department of Systems Biology at DTU for sponsoring food and providing facilities for our conference.
