DTU DENMARK
Greetings from Team DTU!
Our team is made up of 10 students competing in this years iGEM competition. This year's team representing DTU is made up of a diverse group of students, both culturally and scientifically. This means that we get to learn so much from each other, professionally as well as culturally. As we are studying at a technical University, we are given an even greater opportunity to really flex our brain-muscles and be innovative. You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter !
The goal of our project is to enable colonies of E. coli bacteria to transition between production of two different reporter proteins. In our system, switching between states will be induced by exposing the bacteria to light. Each of the states will have a specific frequency associated with it. There are multiple potential applications for biologicals "switches" such as these, this includes the improved control of production of additives in industrial biotechnological processes.
