Meet the DTU team
We are 10 students and 4 supervisors participating in this years iGEM competition. Our team can be characterized as being very diverse both culturally and scientifically as you can easily see from our background descriptions. This has been considered as a big advantage by all of us and due to language confusions we had a lot of fun!
You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter !

Our Team of Students
Anastasiya S. Haugaard
Scientific Background
Molecular Biology and Chemistry
About me
I am Ukrainian and I have been living in Denmark for about 8 years. I have finished international high school IB (International Baccalaureate) at Nørre Gymnasium. Then I went to study at Roskilde University, where I received a Bachelor degree in Molecular Biology and Chemistry. Currently I am taking Masters in Biotechnology at DTU. I am mostly interested in Biomedical Microbiology and that is why I follow this study line. In my spare time I enjoy travelling, reading good books and spending time with my friends and family, especially by making “movies and dinner” times, etc. I am also going to a gym and doing other sports on regular basis.
Anja Sander
Scientific Background
Molecular Biomedicine
About me
I am original from Germany, but now I lived in Denmark for about 14 years and I like it ;-) I started to study Medicine at Aarhus University, just to find out that I, instead of treating patients, like more to do research on the causes of a given disease. That is why I have taken a bachelors degree in Molecular Biomedicine at Copenhagen University and now continue with my master studies at DTU. Bacteria are my love and therefore I want to specialize in Biomedical Microbiology. Besides bacteria, my academic focus is on immunology, medicine, antibiotic resistance and infection mechanisms, but also what it means to conduct good science and experimental set-ups incl. scientific writing. I am going to write my master thesis at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in the USA and I am really looking forward to this! In my spare time I enjoy spending my time with my husband, family and friends. I love indoor climbing, some day I will try outdoor climbing of course (until then practice, practice...), but it is a fascinating sport, believe me ;-) One of my dreams is to travel around the world, but at the moment the duration of time must be shorter than 80 days ;-)
Annemi Ingebrekt Jollmann
Scientific Background
Chemistry and Biotechnology Engineering
About me
Born and raised in Denmark, and having finished a Bachelor degree in Diploma Chemistry & Biotechnology at the Technical University of Denmark, I continued onto the Master degree in Biotechnology which I currently have one and a half years left in. My interests lie within Microbiology in terms of my studies. In my spare time I love to travel and play any form of games, sports wise I enjoy skiing. As I don’t have an extensive international background as the rest of my team has, I look forward to going on exchange and having an international experience of my own.
Grzegorz 'Greg' Slodkowicz
Scientific Background
Computer Science
About me
Originally from Poland, I moved to Denmark (through Ireland) two years ago. My undergrad studies were in Computer Science and now I'm in Systems Biology programme at DTU. My interests include teaching programming, biological networks and mathematical modeling. When not in front of a computer, I enjoy cooking, biking and squash.
Juliet Frederiksen
Scientific Background
Chemical Engineering
About me
I am half Danish and half Kenyan and grew up on the exotic Island of Mombasa, Kenya. I moved to Denmark when I was 15 years old, at which point I attended an international high school, IB (International Baccalaureate). After receiving my IB diploma, I started studying Chemical Engineering at DTU because I believe that everything in life is essentially chemistry ;). Other than my passion for chemistry and laughing, I am an avid runner and love spending time with my friends or relaxing in a café with a good book.
Lisa Blanc Iversen
Scientific Background
Biotechnology Engineering
About me
I’m half danish and half argentinian but I grew up in Denmark. I got my linguistic high school diploma in 2002 and after that I spent some years working, travelling and studying math, chemistry and physics so that I could start my studies at DTU. At this moment I’m pregnant and the baby is due the end of November. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my friends or my husband. I used to play soccer but now I’m only allowed to watch it on TV.
Martin Malthe Borch
Scientific Background
Biotechnology Engineering
About me
I enjoy life when I’m in the wild nature the mountains, on or below big waves. I am fascinated by unbelievable organisms, plants and animals and by the balance and complexity of nature and what we can learn from it. I find gratification by experiencing cultural diversity and new perspectives on life; through people I meet their story, traditions, music and food. I am trying to merge all this into my study to become a biological engineer. I have specialized in biorefinery and bioreactor design, and I’m going to work on Risø-DTU developing a sustainable biorefinery platform, for the future sustainable agricultural and industrial production by microorganism. I am a professional rescue diver, surf lifeguard and climbing instructor. I am fluent in English, French Spanish and Danish.
Maya Friis Kjaergaard
Scientific Background
Biotechnology Engineering
About me
I am 100% Danish and I grew up north of Copenhagen. I study biotechnology at DTU, and at the moment I’m doing my master degree. I went to highschool in a town called Nyborg where I completed the international IB programme. I have lived in Spain several times, both with my family and alone, and I therefore speak fluent Spanish. I love the Spanish culture, especially the food and the night life. In my free time I like being with my friends, run, bike and play music. I also like to travel and experience the world which is why I spent a semester of my master degree in the US. Professionally, my interests are stem cells, immunology, cell biology and synthetic biology.
Patrick Fortuna
Scientific Background
Biotechnology Engineering
About me
I’m a South African that has been living and studying in Denmark for the last 7 years, yet have also lived in Canada. After having finished my International Baccalaureate (IB) high school diploma I continued onto the Technical University of Denmark where I’m currently finishing my bachelor degree in Biotechnology. My interests within my studies are genetic engineering, synthetic biology, and molecular cell biology. Outside of the books I spend most of my time on sports, ranging from rugby to any form of functional strength and conditioning workouts. On all other occasions I’ll be either spending time with friends, doing some travelling, or enjoying food.
Thomas Trolle
Scientific Background
Biochemistry
About me
I’m half Danish, half Chinese and was born in Copenhagen. At the age of 4, I moved to Hong Kong with my family, where we lived for 8 years before moving back to Denmark. After 3 years of primary school and 3 years of high school, I got my high school diploma in 2006 at Virum Gymnasium. I went on to study biochemistry at Copenhagen University and got my bachelors degree in 2009. I am currently halfway through the Masters Program in Systems Biology at DTU. My interests include immunology, bioinformatics and protein structure. In my spare time I enjoy playing computer games and spending time with my friends.
Our Supervisors
Chris Workman
Scientific Background
Christopher Workman is associate professor at the Center of Biological Sequence Analysis (CBS) at DTU. Dr. Workman has nine years of combined biotech industry and post-graduate experience. This includes three years of postdoctoral training in a leading Systems Biology lab at the University of California, San Diego headed by Dr. Trey Ideker. During this period he led a project that resulted in a map of transcriptional regulatory pathways that control the DNA damage response in yeast and a first author publication in Science. Dr. Workman has developed a number of bioinformatic tools and analysis methods that support research in transcriptional regulation. He has extensive experience analyzing gene expression microarray data from almost all technology platforms. In particular, he has pioneered improved methods of Affymetrix probe-level data analysis and has contributed to the widely used Bioconductor project. He has also contributed as a developer for the Cytoscape open source project. (reference http://www.phenoxigen.eu/index.php?id=3)
Mogens Kilstrup
Scientific Background
Mogens Kilstrup received his master degree in 1986 in biochemistry from the University of Copenhagen as well as his PhD degree in Molecular biology in 1992.
