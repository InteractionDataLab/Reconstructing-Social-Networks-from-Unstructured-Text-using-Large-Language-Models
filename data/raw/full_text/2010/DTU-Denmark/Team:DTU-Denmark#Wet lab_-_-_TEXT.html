Wetlab
On this page is described the experiences, procedures and protocols that we have used. Further the experimental process is described for the two parallel tracks, the repressor and terminator part, what have we experienced when working with our parts, and the BB standard.
Protocols For all the methods we have shaped the protocols to the standards and experiences of our lab.  We have collected the protocols we used in a comprehensive list below where it is possible to read them in full length. They contain our procedure as well as references. Some time this might be weakly documented when given to us by communication with supervisors.
