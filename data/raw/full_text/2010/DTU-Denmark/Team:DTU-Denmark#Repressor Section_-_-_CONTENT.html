We already know that this system is tight in its natural settings in <I>Salmonella</I>, but to our knowledge no one before us has tried to characterize the system in <I>Escherichia coli</I>. A good way to characterize it in <I>E.coli</I> is to test whether the repression of the pR promoters is tight, and if the anti-repressors indeed do antirepress. Because of previous knowledge of the strength of the promoters in <I>Salmonella</I> all characterization had to be done in low-copy-number plasmids. 
We have characterized the following BioBricks:

We designed a primer pair to amplify the immunity region from Gifsy 1 and Gifsy 2, and by adding the standardized prefix and suffix as a tail, the amplicons were made Biobrick compatible. The amplicons were made by PCR. After the PCR the fragments were cleaned up using a <A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/Lab_protocols#PCR_purification">PCR clean-up kit</A>.

pIGR05/06 are designed to have a different origin of replication than pIGR03/04 which allows transformation of both plasmids into the same <I>E. coli</I> strain.

<H3>Results</H3><P align="justify">Our first discovery was that when growing the <I>E. coli</I> transformants, carrying the pIGR01 or pIGR02 plasmid, we saw a wide variety not only in colony size, but also in level of GFP expression. Colonies with visible expression of GFP were significantly smaller in size indicating that the pR promoter expresses GFP to a level that becomes toxic to the cells,see figure 5.</P><TABLE class="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2010/8/8e/PIGR01_4.1.jpg" align="center"><CAPTION align="bottom"><P align="justify"><B>Figure 5</B> Agar-plate with colonies of <I>E. coli</I> carrying pIGR01.

This might be because the cells without the repressor expresses GFP which might be toxic to the cells. The reference strain DH5α seems to grow at the same rate as pIGR03.</P><P align="”justify”">The biomass shift for pIGR01 around (5;200) indicates that the cells change morphology or cell size due to a re-arrangement of metabolism in order to utilize other aspects of the growth media after the exhaustion of others.
