BioLector
To characterize our constructs we have used BioLector apparatus, friendly provided by the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis (CBS) at DTU. BioLector is an innovative device allowing up to 96 fermentations simultaneously, also of aerobic cultures. Utilization of multi-parameter plates allows measurement of various biological parameters. OD and fluorescence in our cell cultures is detected through the transparent bottom of the plates. Detection of pH and DO (oxygen partial pressure) is also possible through optodes (optical sensors) positioned in the bottom of the wells. All of these parameters can be monitored and visualized for further analysis. In our project the BioLector has been used to measure the levels of expression of GFP and RFP in bacterial cultures over time. The biomass of the cells has also been estimated by measuring scattered light.
