Introduction
In synthetic biology when creating the minimal cell  XXX factors have been identified as essential for normal function of RNAP, both regarding normal elongation but also in terms of normal termination function. (REFFF) of these XXX have been identified to take part in regulatory function. While the rest is core subunits. Of interest for regulation in terms of termination Anti-termination will be highlighted:
NusA:
NusG:
NusE:
NusB:
Due to the construction of the RNAP of many subcomponents and systems, the function of the RNAP can be regulated by only adding or changing one or a few factors. This is the mechanism in the different termination and anti-termination functions described below.
