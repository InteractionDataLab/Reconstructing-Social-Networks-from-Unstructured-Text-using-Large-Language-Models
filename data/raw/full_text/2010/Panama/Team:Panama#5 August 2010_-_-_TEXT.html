Plasmid DNA concentration measurements
1.Promoter: 27,8 ng/ul
2.RBS: 42 ng/ul
3.Reporter: 40,3 ng/ul
Digestion mix Promoter and RBS:
After the plasmid DNA concentration measurements we continued with the restriction reaction of the plasmids.

This reaction was incubated at 37ºC for 3 hours, in the thermocycler.

NOTE: The plasmid was not digested because we didn't resuspend it in water (it comes in a lyophilized form).
Electrophoresis of the terminator BioBrick.
We prepared 1% of agarose. In each well we add: 5ul of sample, 2 ul of loading buffer. The marker used is HindIII, 1ul + 2ul loading buffer.
Now, for some reason, the sample didn't stay inside the wells.

The expected band was 2160pb but actually it resulted much higher, aproximately in the 3000pb range and seems too high. This isn´t a satisfactory result because it doesn't have the necessary length.
