Miniprep
Today we did the minipreps of the cultures that we grew for 16 hours yesterday.
Today we performed the miniprep of the E. coli transformed with the RBS and Promoter parts. This miniprep was made in triplicate.
Electrophoresis
After the miniprep we made an electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel with 1X TBE buffer. Also, we measured the DNA concentration with a spectrophotometer:

NOTE: From here on end, when we see 1 and 2 for the samples, we mean that the second one is a duplicate.
Expected size
RBS=2092 bp
Promoter=2103 bp
Reporter=2800 bp
Spectrometer measurement
[RBS]=30,4 ηg/μl
Digestion
After the DNA concentration measurement, we performed the digestion of the RBS and Promoter parts.
These quantities of reaction materials were used for both the RBS and the Promoter Reactions:
