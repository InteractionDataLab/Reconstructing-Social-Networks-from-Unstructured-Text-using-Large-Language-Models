Continuing with the mutagenesis...
Then, after starting the mutagenesis we did a digestion with Dnp according to the mutagenesis protocol, the cells were transformed, and they were put onto LB plates to grow overnight.
During our scrrening process we have come across many colonies and so we have performed several minipreps to chek our colonies. This is the one belonging to plate 10. Only blue colonies were found on plate 10. Four white colonies were inoculated into LB broth to grow overnight. From those cultures, we did minipreps.
