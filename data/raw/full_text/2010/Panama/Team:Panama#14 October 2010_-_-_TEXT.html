Prepared Ampicillin stock (50 mg/ml)
We did a miniprep on the 11 colonies that grew in liquid LB medium with Amp. (The method we used was without columns because the kit ran out). Then, we ran a gel of 1% agarose to see if we could see a difference in the size of the linear band of the plasmid to be able to determine if it contains the insert (Rh1AB) or not.

Miniprep Protocol: For this procedure we used what is called a "dirty miniprep". And by dirty we don't mean that we did it with unclean utensils nor did we do it after coming from a soccer game; it means that the reagents were prepared in the lab and they weren't obtained from a commercial kit.
