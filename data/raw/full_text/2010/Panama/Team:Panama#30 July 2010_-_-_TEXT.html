Plasmid + Terminator Miniprep
We performed the miniprep of the terminator.
Note: We noted that the growth of colonies of a different color (pink). We don't know whether they are the same colonies that went through some kind of change since we already made slides and through the microscope they look the same. The control plate does not look contaminated!
