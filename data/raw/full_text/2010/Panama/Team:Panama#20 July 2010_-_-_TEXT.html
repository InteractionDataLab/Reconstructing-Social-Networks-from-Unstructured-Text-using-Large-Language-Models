Activities:BioBrick extraction from the distribution plates
Methodology Steps:
1.Locate the BioBrick parts that we are going to assemble in the distribution plates.
RBS: 2M, GFP: 14K, Terminator: 13D & Promoter: 15N
2. Resuspend the plasmid part with 10ul water (Nuclease free, distilled)
For that we take the DNA from each of the wells of the plate. We used 2ul of each part to performed the E. coli transformation. The remaining 8ul were store at -20°C.
3.Transformed the E. coli with the chosen BioBrick parts.
For the extraction we follow the comercial protocol. We transformed 4 different bacteria, for the different BioBrick plasmids.

Incubate at 37°C overnight LB agar plates were prepared with Ampicillin, pH 7.5
For the ampicilin we made a frozen stock solution with a concentration of 50ug/ml in water. In the plate we used a concentration of 100mg/ml.
