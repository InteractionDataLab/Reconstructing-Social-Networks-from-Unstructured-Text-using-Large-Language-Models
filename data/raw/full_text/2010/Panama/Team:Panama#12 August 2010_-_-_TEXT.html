And more minipreps
Today we performed the plasmidic DNA extraction from the RBS and promoter using a Promega Kit.
DNA concentration measurement
RBS 1 = 6.5ng/ul
RBS 2 = 9.5ng/ul
Promoter 1 = 12.2ng/ul
Promoter 2 = 14.1ng/ul
P. aeruginosa 1 = 6.0ng/ul
P. aeruginosa 2 = 98ng/ul
P. aeruginosa 3 = 75ng/ul
DNA Precipitation:
1. We placed twice the volume of absolute ethanol for 15 minutes in ice. To that we added 12.5ul of NaC2H3O2 2M.
2. This was centrifuged at 12000RPM for 5 minutes.
3. We washed with twice the volume of ethanol at 70%.
4. Again this was centrifuged at the previous conditions.
5. The supernatant was eliminated.
6. After this, we let the ethanol dry up.
7. The product was resuspended in 20ul of DNAse free water.
