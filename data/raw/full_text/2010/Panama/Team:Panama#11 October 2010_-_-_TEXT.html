October 11
Today we measure the concentration of the purified PCR product and the result was 107ug/ml.
We also determined that for the cloning using the pGEMT Easy Kit it is necessary to use a ratio of 3:1. 3 being the vector amount and 1 being the insert amount.
Now we are cloning with the pGEMT Easy Kit
Electrophoresis of the ligation product: Terminator, GFP
1% agarose gel, TBE 1X, 2.5ul EtBr. We decided to leave well 3 empty just so it'd look pretty, pretty and it does!
