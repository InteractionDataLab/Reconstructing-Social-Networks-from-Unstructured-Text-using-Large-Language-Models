Summary
SOB Medium.  Used in growing bacteria for preparing chemically competent cells
Ingredients
0.5% (w/v) yeast extract
2% (w/v) tryptone
10 mM NaCl
2.5 mM KCl
20 mM MgSO4
Per liter:
5 g yeast extract
20 g tryptone
0.584 g NaCl
0.186 g KCl
2.4 g MgSO4
Note: Some formulations of SOB use 10 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM MgSO4 instead of 20 mM MgSO4.
SOB medium is also available dry premixed from Difco, 0443-17.
Adjust to pH 7.5 prior to use.  This requires approximately 25 ml of 1M NaOH per liter.
15/10 medium
Growth of competent TOP10 cells in Example 2 of the Bloom05 patent is performed in 15/10 broth, which is similar to SOB:
1.5% yeast extract
1% Bacto-Tryptone
10mM NaCl
2mM KCl
10 mM MgCl2
10 mM MgSO4

Trivia
SOB supposedly stands for super optimal broth.
