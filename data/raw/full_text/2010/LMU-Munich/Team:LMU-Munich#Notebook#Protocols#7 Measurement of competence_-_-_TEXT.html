Measurement of competence
Transform 50 μl of cells with 1 μl of standard pUC19 plasmid (Invitrogen)
This is at 10 pg/μl or 10-5 μg/μl
This can be made by diluting 1 μl of NEB pUC19 plasmid (1 μg/μl, NEB part number N3401S) into 100 ml of TE
Hold on ice 0.5 hours
Heat shock 60 sec at 42°C
Add 250 μl SOC
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour in 2 ml centrifuge tubes rotated
using 2ml centrifuge tubes for transformation and regrowth works well because the small volumes flow well when rotated, increasing aeration.
For our plasmids (pSB1AC3, pSB1AT3) which are chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistant, we find growing for 2 hours yields many more colonies
Ampicillin and kanamycin appear to do fine with 1  hour growth
Plate 20 μl on AMP plates using sterile 3.5 mm glass beads
Good cells should yield around 100 - 400 colonies
Transformation efficiency is (dilution factor=15) x colony count x 105/µgDNA
We expect that the transformation efficiency should be between 5x108 and 5x109 cfu/µgDNA
