Cell Line
The cell line used in this project is the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T .
Databases Search
The NCBI GEO and ArrayExpress databases were extensively searched for environmental conditions leading to apoptosis in 293T cells and genes differentially expressed under these conditions. The following data was obtained:
Environmental Condition (EV)
Number of genes differentially expressed
Reference

In order to understand gene regulation of apoptosis regulated genes the Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED) was used to extract known promoters and the STRING database for known and predicted protein-protein interactions. The lists of all known human transcription factors were downloaded from here and here .
