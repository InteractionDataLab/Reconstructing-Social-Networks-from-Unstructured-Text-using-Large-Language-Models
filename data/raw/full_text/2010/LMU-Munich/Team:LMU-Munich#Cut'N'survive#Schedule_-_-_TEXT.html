Aim 3: Assembling Biobricks
We are using the 3A System to assemble Biobricks.
Assembled Biobricks:
BB7 (BBa_K368007): assembled [ ]; tet-on promoter (prev TRE CMV) + TEV recognition site + SF3b155;
Sequence of BB7 from sequencing confirmed: [ ]
BB8 (BBa_K368008): assembled [ ]; Human Bak + SV40PA ;
Sequence of BB8 from sequencing confirmed: [ ]
BB9 [BBa_K368009): assembled [ ]; tet-on promoter (prev TRE CMV) + TEV recognition site + SF3b155 + Human Bak + SV40PA;
Sequence of BB9 from sequencing confirmed: [ ]
BB10 (BBa_K368010): assembled [ ]; CMV-promoter + TEV protesase + p14* + TEV recognition site ;
Sequence of BB10 from sequencing confirmed: [ ]
BB11 (BBa_K368011): assembled [X]; eGFP + SV40PA ;
Sequence of BB11 from sequencing confirmed: [X]
BB12 (BBa_K368012): assembled [ ]; CMV-promoter + TEV protesase + p14* + TEV recognition site + eGFP + SV40PA;
Sequence of BB12 from sequencing confirmed: [ ]
Assembling Construct 1
Assembling Construct 2
Aim 4: Testing products
Construct 1
- transform into HeLa cells to see if they survive.
-> Check the leakiness of tet-on-promoter
- induce tet-on-promoter to see, if cells die.
-> Check if construct 1 is working
Construct 2
- Transform into HeLa cells and see if eGFP is being translated
-> Check if CMV-promoter is working and construct is being read-off completely
- Western Blot
-> Check by reference of protein size if eGFP is cut off from the residual of the protein by TEV-Protease
Aim 5: Testing system
