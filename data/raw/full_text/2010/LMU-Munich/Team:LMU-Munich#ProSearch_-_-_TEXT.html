ProSearch System
This system is to search for new enhancer-promoter combinations that efficiently trigger gene expression in response to different stimuli. This part of the project is carried out through a bioinformatic modeling process. The end-product is a databank of related genes, their promoters and transcription factors at the input of a wished environmental condition. This system is useful for the construction of new inducible systems trying to utilize apoptosis or other gene expression in the human cell-line 293T.
