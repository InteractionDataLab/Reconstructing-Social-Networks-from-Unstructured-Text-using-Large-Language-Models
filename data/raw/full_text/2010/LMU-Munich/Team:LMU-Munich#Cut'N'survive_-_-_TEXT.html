Cut'N'Survive System
In this system, the apoptosis triggering protein Bak is controlled by the Tet-on system for inducible apoptosis. Bak can be degraded when the target gene is successfully expressed, therefore ensuring the survival of the wanted cells. Bak is combined with a certain interacting protein p14*, TEV-protease recognition site and N-Degron. This construct should be stably integrated into the cell line genome. The target plasmid consists of eGFP as target gene, another TEV-protease recognition site, the interaction partner of p14* and TEV-protease. When the target plasmid is expressed, the interaction proteins bring the TEV-protease together with its recognition site; TEV cuts Bak, together with N-Degron, free from the rest of the protein complex, where N-Degron with its free N-terminal acts as degradation signal of protease in the cells. Thus this system enables selection of cells expressing the target gene while the cells not transfected undergo induced apoptosis.
