ByeByeBioBrick-Party
On Wednesday, October the 20th, we said goodbye to our BioBricks and submitted them to the registry in US. To celebrate the completion of this part of our project and to thank all the people who provided help and instruction, we held the ByeByeBioBrick-Party at the university. All our supervisors and instructors as well as most of the team were at the party. Lab food was provided: cheese and olives on pipette tips, jelly with gummi-bear in petri dishes, cocktail in Falcon tubes...There's no limit to the fun we had at the lab!
