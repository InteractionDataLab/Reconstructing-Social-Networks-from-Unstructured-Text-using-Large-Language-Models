Welcome!
The future of synthetic biology lies in expanding our ability to   engineer genes in new organisms. Our project develops a system to   engineer the genome of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechocystis   sp. PCC6803, establishes expression standards for this species, and adds   a set of characterized Synechocystis promoters and ribosome binding   sites to the BioBrick toolbox. We developed a BioBrick vector that can   be used to assemble parts and devices in E. coli. Upon transformation   into Synechocystis, it integrates the device directly into the genome   through homologous recombination. We utilized genes that were activated   under a variety of conditions, from those responding to heat stress to   ones oscillating under a circadian rhythm. The promoters and ribosome   binding sites were converted into BioBrick-compatible parts, and   subsequently characterized. Our success will enable the use of existing   parts in new species, and will expand the range of devices that can be built.
