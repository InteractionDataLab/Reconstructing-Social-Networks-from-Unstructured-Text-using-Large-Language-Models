Lighting device
1. Introduction
To make the characterization of our biological system we developped a lighting device which can be controlled from a computer. The goal of this device is to create red and infrared pulses which period and duration are fixed by the user in a computer interface.
The lighting part of the device is composed of two parts:
• A LEDs band which is composed of four red LEDs put alternately with four infrared LEDs and used to enlighten a tube
• A box subdivided into a 3-by-3 matrix of compartments, each one containing a red and an infrared LED and used to enlighten independently nine biological materials
These two parts are represented on the following scheme:
2. Printed circuit board
We designed the printed circuit board with Kicad, a free PCB design tool. You can download Kicad at this address:
http://www.lis.inpg.fr/realise_au_lis/kicad/
Here you can download the PCB file of the circuit:
The following picture explains the different components used:
And here is the list of the corresponding components used:
• A1, A2, A3, B1,  B2 , B3, C1,  C2 and C3: LEDs connectors
• B1: LEDs band connector
• Q1: quartz 4 MHz
• PIC: Microchip PIC 18F452
• MAX: MAX232
• DB9: DB9 connector
• PB: reset button
• P1: power connector (9 V)
• P2: 78L05L voltage regulator (5 V)
• R1: LEDs resistors (100 Ω)
• RC1: resistor (10 kΩ) and capacitor (100 nF) for the reset
• C1: quartz capacitor (33 pF)
• C2: power decoupling capacitor (33 nF)
• C3,C4,C5,C6: MAX232 capacitors (10 µF)
• C7: 78L05L capacitor (330 nF)
3. Microcontroller software
The microcontroller used is a Microchip pic 18F452 which is easily programmable in C language with MPLAB combined to a C18 compiler. The link between the computer and the microcontroller is carried through the serial port.
Here you can download the hex file of the program:
And here are the source files of the software:
4. Computer software
We developped the computer software with Microsoft Visual C++. You can download Express version at this address:

The following picture illustrates the software interface:
Here you can download the software:
