iGEM - INTERNATIONAL GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MACHINES
iGEM (international Genetically Engineered Machines) is a competition  organized by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in Boston, USA,  since 2004 and has become one of the largest international competitions in the  field of science. This year 128 teams of undergraduate students compete against  each other, and for the second time ESBS-Strasbourg team is joining this  competition.
Synthetic biology is a new area of biological research that combines science and engineering. Synthetic biology encompasses a variety of  different approaches, methodologies and disciplines. We can define the synthetic  biology as the design and (re)construction of new biological  functions and systems not found in nature.
Similar to the construction of a car,  Synthetic Biology uses simple gene building blocks for the construction of new complex systems with distinct functions.  These gene building blocks are collected in a database by iGEM and can  be used by all participants of the competition. So far, the collection contains  more than 13,000 gene building blocks , due to the continuous development of  new parts over the last years. This summer all teams work on self-developed  projects which will then be presented in the beginning of November at the  “Jamboree” in Boston. Several prizes in different categories will be awarded.
ESBS-Strasbourg Team
We are a student-run team from the trinational graduate school "École supérieur de Biotechnologie Strasbourg" (ESBS) located in the capital of Europe - Strasbourg, France. The ESBS is a joint-venture of the Universities of Freiburg and Karlsruhe in  Germany, the University of Bale in Switzerland and the University of Strasbourg  in France. Students come from all four partner universities and furthermore from  all around the three countries.
This is the second year that the ESBS-Strasbourg participates in the iGEM  competition. Our team consists of 12 students coming from different  scientific backgrounds prior to the ESBS. This will help us to deal with the  difficulties coming up during this interdisciplinary project. Our shared  education at the ESBS however enables us to communicate more easily with each  other. An overview of the people involved and our competences can be found on  the team page.
