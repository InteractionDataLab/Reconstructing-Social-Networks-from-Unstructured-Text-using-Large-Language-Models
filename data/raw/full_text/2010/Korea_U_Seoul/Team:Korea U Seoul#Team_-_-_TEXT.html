Our Team
The aim of our project is to create a bacterium that can detect several heavy metals in water : Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury. If arsenic is present, GFP is expressed. If mercury, RFP is expressed. If cadmium, we can see cells become brown. This is because of amd gene products.  The bacteria contain all the three genes. Therefore, when more than two heavy metals is in water, each color is mixed so we detect several metals simultaneously. Freezedrying and Capsuling of bacteria, carrying is easier.
