Parts
New for iGEM 2010 is the groupparts tag.  This tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.

Part:BBa_K400000
Designed by Jonghwa Kim   Group: iGEM10_Korea_U_Seoul   (2010-10-21) composite heavy metal-detector(Zn, Cd, As)
It is a composite part of heavy metal-detecting promoters and reporter genes.
PyodA-mAAA(BBa_K400628)----PzntA-RFP(BBa_E0040)----ParsR-GFP(BBa_J04450)----
It detects cadmium, zinc, and arsenic in the media and gives brown, red, and green color. This is our final product to put in a
capsule in order to be customized.
Part:BBa_K400628
Designed by Seobeom Heo   Group: iGEM10_Korea_U_Seoul   (2010-10-19)
mAAA (EcoRI site mutated Aryl Acyl-Amidase)
Aryl acylamidase is an enzyme that acts in the amide bond between aryl- and acyl- compounds. The most typical reaction is the hydrolysis :of an anilide, producing a carboxylate and aniline, which is reversible. When a p-acetaminophenol was reacted with AAA, the product gave :a purple-red color. As a result, a clone presenting AAA activity from the genomic library gave a color change around the colony when it :was grown on solid media enriched with p-acetaminophenol.Since it gives color to colorless substance, it can be used as a reporter gene to a specific promoter. In our project, we put it :downstream of cadmium-dependent promoter to detect any cadmium present in a solution.
