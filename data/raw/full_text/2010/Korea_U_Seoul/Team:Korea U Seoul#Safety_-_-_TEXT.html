Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
No. Our promoters and linked genes(amd, GFP, etc.) are conisdered to cause no harm to the environment.
2.Do any of the new BioBrick parts that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No. the parts that we made do not raise any safety issues.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Yes, we have a Bioethics Committee, composed of professors from various departments; Lifescience, Law, Medical School.
These are what they consider :
1) The ethical, scientifical validity of biotechnology research
2) Whether appropriate procedures were taken in case of organic parts donation(sperms, eggs, cells, etc.).
3) Whether appropriate saftey measures regarding the donor and his/her rights are prepared.
4) Any other subjects related to bitotechnology research & development done in the university
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
First, we think that for making the dealing with safety issues more comportable, it is better that iGEM HQ shows more concrete criteria and guide lines for the safety issues. Next, make it a rule to do the safety-proving experiment when the iGEM team's project shows some safety related problems.
