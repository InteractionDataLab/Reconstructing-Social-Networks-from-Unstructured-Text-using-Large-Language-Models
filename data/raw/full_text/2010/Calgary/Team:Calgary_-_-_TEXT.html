Our modelling project consists of two components: a mathematical model done in MATLAB and an animation done in Autodesk Maya. We hope to model the formation of inclusion bodies, which are aggregations of misfolded protein that can occur within cells. Using Maya, we also hope to visually show other students one of the proposed aggregation mechanisms described in the literature. Read more here...
Our outreach project included educating highschool students about iGEM. Outreach also entailed blog entries and podcasts about synthetic life, iGEM and open source as well as genetically modified foods. The blog entry, podcasts and high school presentations allowed the iGEM students to spread knowledge about iGEM to the general public and to potential future scientists. Read more here...
What new dangers and unintended consequences will synthetic biology pose to us in the future? iGEM Calgary travels to Defence Research and Development Canada Suffield, a major Canadian Military Research facility that specializes in chemo-biological threats. Read more...
The University of Calgary, Alberta, and Lethbridge iGEM teams met in Lethbridge at a conference put on by Alberta Innovates Technology Futures to learn important aspects of iGEM. Read more...
Have you ever seen an aggregate protein dance? Look out for iGEM Calgary’s rambunctious mascot “Protein Man” at the Jamboree promoting proper protein expression. Learn more about him...
Team Calgary brings iGEM awareness to the community. The iGEM bake sale was a great success, both in selling cupcakes and educating customers about our team. See what else we've been doing...
Alberta’s very own Jamboree. The three Alberta iGEM teams, the Universities of Alberta, Calgary, and Lethbridge meet to perform a practice project presentation to each other. Experts within their field are also present to give teams challenging questions, and then meet with each team to suggest improvements. Read more...

Wetlab
You’re stressing me out! This year, in the wetlab, we have been designing a reporter system to detect problems in protein expression.  Our system uses a visual output to allow specificity in determining which step in protein expression problems are occurring.
Modelling
Our modeling project has focused on simulating and modeling the formation of inclusion bodies, aggregates of protein within the cell.  We've been exploring the factors that lead to their formation.
Community
Our human practices section focused on exploring ethical issues in synthetic biology through an ethics paper as well as a podcast focusing on a few key issues.  Our outreach initiatives also allowed the iGEM students to spread knowledge about iGEM to the general public and to potential future scientists through activities such as   high school presentations and participation in various research symposiums.
