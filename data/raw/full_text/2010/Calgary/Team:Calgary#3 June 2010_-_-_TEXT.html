Thursday June 3, 2010
Today, Dev, Patrick, Chris, Jeremy, and Alex attended the Biosafety I course that was mandatory for us to work in the lab in the morning. Himika and Emily observed the transformation growth on the plates that were made yesterday (I0500 was remade) and continued their research  for presentations tomorrow. We Miniprepped the Overnight cultures and then froze the bacteria. Finally, we transformed plasmids I3453 and I0500 (both copies included with the Registry plates) and plated all on ampicillin, kanamycin, and ampicillin-kanamycin plates.
