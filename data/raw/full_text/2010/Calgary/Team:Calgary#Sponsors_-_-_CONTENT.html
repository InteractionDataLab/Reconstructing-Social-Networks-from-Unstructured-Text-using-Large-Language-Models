Now, Autodesk provides a wide range of products for engineers, architects, manufacturers, designers, and artists. Over 10 million professionals worldwide use Autodesk products to streamline the design process and help digitally visualize their ideas. Digital modelling allows designers and clients alike to visualize projects long before they even begin construction. This year, Autodesk was generous enough to sponsor iGEM, providing each student access to Autodesk <I>Maya</I>. <I>Maya</I> is a powerful animation and 3D-modelling software that can be used to animate and simulate various cellular molecules and processes. Autodesk has also graciously agreed to sponsor iGEM Calgary, and we have used <I>Maya</I> this year for our animations.</P><SPAN style="font-size:20px;"><P style="margin:0; padding:0;">BioAlberta</P></SPAN><SPAN class="sotm" style="font-size:20px;"><P style="margin:0; padding:0;">Sponsor of the Month: June</P></SPAN><P>BioAlberta is a private not-for-profit organization that aims to promote life sciences within Alberta through various methods. They focus on promotion of companies, development of life sciences within the province, and the creation of a network between various biotechnology companies to facilitate the acquisition of supplies. With these services, businesses are able to operate in a more cost-effective manner and biotechnology can better grow in Alberta. The organisation is sponsored by international corporations like AstraZeneca, Merck Frost, AVAC, and McCarthy Tetrault.</P><SPAN style="font-size:20px;"><P style="margin:0; padding:0;">New England Biolabs</P></SPAN><SPAN class="sotm" style="font-size:20px;"><P style="margin:0; padding:0;">Sponsor of the Month: May</P></SPAN><P>For over 30 years, New England Biolabs has led the industry in the discovery and production of enzymes for molecular biology applications. At NEB, enzyme production is linked to basic research in the cloning and overexpression of restriction/modification systems. Their focus on providing the largest selection of recombinant enzymes has resulted in lower dollar-per-unit costs and improved purity and consistency of product. Presently, NEB supplies more than 240 restriction enzymes, over 160 of which are available in recombinant form, as well as numerous recombinant DNA and protein modifying enzymes.</P><SPAN style="font-size:20px;"><P style="margin:0; padding:0;">Corning Life Sciences</P></SPAN><P>Corning Life Sciences is a company that has been developing and manufacturing laboratory supplies for more than 90 years. In 1915, Corning introduced the first Pyrex glass products, and ever since it is a global leader in consumable glass and plastic laboratory tools. Throughout the last century, Corning has not only been a trusted source of supplies, but also has been a major player in research and development of new technology, advancing the field of life sciences.</P><SPAN style="font-size:20px;"><P style="margin:0; padding:0;">VWR</P></SPAN><P>VWR International is one of the world leaders in the distribution of laboratory materials. There are currently over 250 000 customers in North America and Europe, which is quite large for a biotechnology distributor. They are based in West Chester, Pennsylvania and specialize in the supply of chemicals, equipment, instruments, lab apparel, and lab furniture. They have many offices based worldwide from Northern Ireland to Switzerland and even one based in Singapore. The unique guarantee that they offer is the shipping of ordered material within 24 hours, due to large quantities of stock and many distribution offices in various countries. They have been a significant sponsor of our iGEM team in the past and we appreciate their contribution to our team this year.</P><SPAN style="font-size:20px;"><P style="margin:0; padding:0;">Integrated DNA Technologies</P></SPAN><P>Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) is a world leader in the supplying of custom oligonucleotide sequences.
