Second Life Study Day 3
Today, we discussed the different approaches that labs take towards synthetic biology including those of Pamela Silver, Drew Endy, Christina Smolke, and Robert Weiss. We also discussed the different areas that they specialized in as well as various protocols that they followed in their labs. From this, we gained more knowledge in procedures we could follow or where we could order some lab materials.
