Raida
Today I further edited the "Environment" section of the Ethics Paper. I have also completed a draft of the "Economic" and "Ethical" perspective to understand Synthetic Biology and also our project in particular.
Himika
Today I did a restriction digest of I0500-B0034-MalE31 that was placed in the pSB1AC3 vector. The bands appeared as expected and this confirms that the tubes sent down for sequencing were mislabelled. I also worked on the presentation for aGEM which needs lots of content and polishing before aGEM rolls around. Dr. Schryvers suggested that I use Tracy Raivio's system in order to test I0500 and MalE31 because we know that MalE31 misfolds and it should produce bioluminescence due to presence of Lux protein downstream of the CpxP promoter. I will look more into this tonight and work on testing and characterizing MalE31.
Emily
This evening I came in and made overnight cultures of CpxP in AK and AC as well as ibpAB in AK and IO500 from the registry.  Tomorrow morning we will miniprep all of these cultures.
Chris
Today, I continued contacting some companies about getting sponsorship funding for our project. Currently, our fniancial Situation is pretty good, with us being approximately $3000 short of sending our whole team.
Jeremy
Today I sent pRFP colony 3 in pSB1AK3 from C2 for sequencing. I also finished a lot of wiki layouts and gave all the t-shirt contacts to Dev. I won't be in until next Monday. In the meantime Dev is helping me with site directed mutatgenesis for the pRFP and ordering the t-shirts.
Patrick
Recieved wiki layouts from Jeremy today. Coding them out before applying them to the wiki itself. The main page's general layout is now done. I'm awaiting Paul's code for the tabbed photo box, as well as the shifting green box. Still have yet to fix the blog feed for Internet Explorer.
