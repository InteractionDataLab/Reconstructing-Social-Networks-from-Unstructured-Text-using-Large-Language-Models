iGEM Teacher's Workshop at University of Calgary, Day 2
Today, we learned about different variations of Tom Knight's BioBrick cloning protocols. He also gave tips on what could go wrong in transformation, Analysis, Miniprep, Restriction Digest, Ligation, and Vector backbone creation. After, we learned about part measurement, characterization and how to ship parts to the registry. In the afternoon, we discussed the future of iGEM in terms of the proposed regional iGEM meetings.
