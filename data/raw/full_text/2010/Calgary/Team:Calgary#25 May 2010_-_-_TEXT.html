Tuesday May 25, 2010
Today, we opened the DNA that was sent from the Registry of Parts. We attempted rehydration of plasmids pSB1A2 and pSB2K3 and then using that DNA, we attempted a construction of RFP using J13002 and E1010. We did restriction digest using the protocols indicated and then attempted the construction. The constructions were then plated and then left to grow.
