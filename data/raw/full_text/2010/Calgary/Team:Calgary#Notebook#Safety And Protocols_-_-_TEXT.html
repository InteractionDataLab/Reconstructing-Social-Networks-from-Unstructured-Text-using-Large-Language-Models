Making competent cells
This procedure was done using Top10 Competent cells ordered from Invitrogen. 50 mL Falcon tubes were used for this protocol.
Innoculate 5-10 mL LB at 37°C while shaking
Subculture 1 mL of bacteria solution into 50 mL LB broth at 37° while shaking   until OD600 is 0.4-0.6 (This step should require approximately 2.5 hours)
Centrifuge the subculture at 10 000 rpm at 4°C for 2 minutes
Resuspend pellet in 12.5 mL of cold CaCl2 (50 mM) and leave on ice for 10 minutes
Centrifuge at 10 000 rpm at 4°C for 2 minutes and resuspend in 2 mL of cold CaCl2 (50 mM, 15% glycerol solution)
Leave on ice for at least 30 minutes and then aliquot 200 uL and freeze at -80°C

Restriction digest
This protocol is part of the Construction Protocol. Start by selecting one of the parts you wish to combine as the vector  (the plasmid will be kept) and the other part as the insert. The two parts will need to be mixed separately at the beginning. The parts must be kept separate for the digestion period.
Add to the Insert Tube:
600 ng of DNA (Calculate this from the concentration of plasmid)
3.5 µL of 10x Buffer
0.5 µL of each restriction enzyme used (2 of EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, or PstI)
H2O such that the volume of water and DNA in the tube is 30.5 µL and the total volume in each tube is 35 µL
Add to the Vector Tube:
250 ng of DNA (Calculate this from the concentration of plasmid)
3.5 µL of appropriate 10x Buffer
0.5 µL of each restriction enzyme used (2 of EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, or PstI)
HH2O such that the volume of water and DNA in the tube is 30.5 µL and the total volume in each tube is 35 µL
Mix two tubes as indicated above
Put the tubes into a 37°C water bath for one hour
Place the tubes into an 80°C heating block for 20 minutes to heat-kill the enzymes in the tube
Freeze the parts until they are needed
The Theory - Back to top
Ligation
This protocol is part of the Construction Protocol. The tubes from the Restriction Digest should be removed from the freezer and thawed on ice before beginning ligation.
Mix 5 µL of the insert and 5 &microl: of the vector in a new tube
Clearly label the tubes as unligated, write the date and freeze the tubes in -20°C in case the transformation does not work
Add 10 µL of 2x Quick Ligase Buffer and 1 µL of Quick Ligase to the tube containing the mixed Insert and Vector
Let the tube sit at room temperature for 5 minutes
Transform this mix (all 21 µL) into Top10 Competent Cells

Miniprep Plasmid Preparation (GenElute)
This protocol is taken from the Sigma Aldrich distributed GenElute Miniprep Plasmid Preparation Kits. We modified the elution portion of the procedure by using double distilled water to elute rather than using TE buffer. We also skipped the step with the optional wash solution. Instead, the step with the addition of Wash Solution in the Column Tube was done twice. Another company's kit was used occasionally to prep the plasmids but the two kits were never mixed.
Make overnight cultures from LB agar plate growth (The protocol for the making of overnight cultures can be found as a separate protocol)
After allowing approximately 16 hours of growth, pellet the cells using a centrifuge for 20 minutes at a speed of 4000 rpm at 4°C
Discard the supernatant, while being careful not to discard any of the pellet
Resuspend the pellet in 200 µL of Resuspension Solution (with RNase A added) which is provided from the kit
Transfer the solution from a Falcon tube to a 1.5 µL microcentrifuge tube
Add 200 µL of Lysis Solution and invert gently to mix. Allow the mixture to clear for less than 5 minutes
Add 350 µL of Neutralization Solution and invert the tube 4-6 times to mix
Pellet the microcentrifuge tubes at 14 000 rpm using a microcentrifuge for 15 minutes. The resulting solution will be known as the lysate
Add 500 µL of the Column Preparation Solution to a binding column inside a collection tube. Centrifuge this tube for 1 minute at 14 000 rpm and discard the liquid underneath the binding tube
Transfer the lysate into the binding column, being careful not to transfer any solid. Discard the microcentrifuge tube with the solid
Centrrifuge the collection tube at 14 000 rpm for 1 minute. DIscard whatever liquid flowed through the binding column into the collection tube
Add 750 µL of Wash Solution with concentrated ethanol added to the column and spin at 14 000 rpm for 1 minute. Discard the liquid that flowed through into the collection tube
Repeat Step 12 a second time with the same quantity of Wash Solution
Centrifuge the tube for 1 minute at 14 000 rpm to dry the column
Transfer the column to a new 1.5 µL microcentrifuge tube
Add 50 µL of double distilled water to the column and spin for 1 minute at 14 000 rpm
Use a spectrophotometer to measure the concentration and the purity of your plasmid

Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
This procedure is involved in tandem with a PCR. The first step involves the making of an agarose gel as indicated by the Making of Agarose Gel protocol.
Create an agarose gel tray
Place the gel tray into a gel dock where it will be run. Add TAE buffer such that the entire gel is covered
Make mixed tubes with 3 µL DNA, 2 µL Loading dye, and 15 µL water
Insert 10 µL of the mixture into each well with 5 µL of the 1KB ladder in the first hole
Place thecovering on top and set it to run at 90V
When the bands are approximately halfway through the gel, which should be around 35-40 minutes, turn off the electricity and remove the gel
Use a computer imager to take a picture of the gel
The Theory - Back to top
Making Agarose gel
The agarose gel is made in order to do agarose gel electrophoresis. The procedure is modified by the quantity of agarose added to the solution. The procedure here will detail the making of a 1.5% gel.
Measure out 1.5g of agarose
Add the agarose to 100 mL of TAE buffer. COver the beaker with saran wrap with a hole punched in it
Microwave the solution for 30 seconds and then swirl. Then, microwave for 1 minute at high power and swirl. Finally, microwave for 1 minute further and swirl
Take this solution to the fume hood and add 3 µL of ethidium bromide. Ethidium bromide is a suspected carcinogen so handle with care
Swirl the solution to allow the ethidium bromide to mix
Pour the solution into the tray. Use a 10 µL pipette tip to pop any bubbles that may result and insert the comb
Allow the solution to solidify and remove the comb

Rehydration of registry DNA
The open source Parts Registry is where all parts are sent by iGEM teams each year. The distribution is done in three 384-well plates in dry DNA form. The DNA must be rehydrated, transformed into Top10 Competent cells and then plasmid prepped using the Miniprep Plasmid Prep Protocol as listed above before they are in usable DNA form.
Use a 10 µL pipette tip to puncture the aluminium foil covering of the desired well of DNA
After 5 minutes to allow the DNA to thaw, add 10 µL of double distilled water to the well and pipette up and down 3-4 times until the liquid comes up red
Take 2 µL of DNA and transform these into Top10 Competent Cells using the Transformation Protocol
