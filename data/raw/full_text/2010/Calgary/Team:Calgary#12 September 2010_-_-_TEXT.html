Alberta Genetically Engineered Machine Conference Day 2
Chris
Today, we spent time with various different Alberta Innovates Technology Futures people who also gave us more insight into our projects and the possible directions it could go. We talked with Chris Dambrowitz, Candice Berezan, Lori Sheremeta, Justin Pahara, Wayne Materi, and Andrew Hessel about different areas where we could go with our project. They were very helpful and we will look to implementing these when we get back to Calgary. Special thanks to Alberta Innovates Technology Futures for funding, as well as hosting this great conference!
