Our Blog
This year, iGEM Calgary created a blog that updated with information regarding synthetic biology news, features of other iGEM projects as well as updates of our own team and our project. Our goal was to improve the public image of synthetic biology and showcase the many cool and interesting things that the field can bring. In this way, we hope to reach out to the community and hopefully alleviate some skepticism behind synthetic biology.
