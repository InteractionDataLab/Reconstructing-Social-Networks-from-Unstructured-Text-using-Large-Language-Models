We're off to aGEM!
Emily
Worked on some finishing up details for the presentation for aGEM and did a mock question period.  Off to aGEM, hope that it's an excellent weekend!
Himika
Came in for a few hours today and presented to Dr. Logan to get ready for aGEM. I also did the miniprep for MalE31-DegP system. Off to aGEM!
Chris
Today, I worked more on my part of the presentation for aGEM. We did a mock presentation for Dr. Cairine Logan. As well, did more of a mock question period before leaving for aGEM. In the evening, we continued to work hard, reading papers, working on presentation and questioning each other on different aspects of our project.
Patrick
The team has reached Edmonton now. Lots of work done for our presentation to the University of Alberta, the University of Lethbridge, and a large panel of judges for tomorrow. Very exciting. Many kinks in the presentation ironed out, and we also quizzed each other quite a bit in preparation for questions tomorrow.
