Second Life Study Day 5
Today was the last day of our week-long study of synthetic biology using Second Life. We discussed the general ethics concerns that synthetic biology encounter through Second Life and this was once again recorded using the project. Specifically, we discussed the issues that bioterrorism and creating artificial life could bring up. From this discussion, our understanding of the ethics of the project was definitely improved and it gave us ideas of what we could address through our project.
