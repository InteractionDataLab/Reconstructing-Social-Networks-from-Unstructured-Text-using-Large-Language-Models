The Protein Man!
Hey iGEM-ers,
This is Protein Man checking in! I hope the iGEM competition is not stressing you out too much! Remember, stress causes protein misfolding, and my job is to promote proper protein expression. I will be the mascot of the 2010 iGEM Calgary team, whose project is about stress detection in our favourite bug E. coli or any other bugs that y’all might be using for your project.
I wish you all good luck and keep an eye out for me at the iGEM jamboree! And ladies, you can totally aggregate around me to relieve your stress. *wink*
Checking out,
Protein man!
