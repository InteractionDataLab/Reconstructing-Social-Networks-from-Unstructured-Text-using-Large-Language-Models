Dr. Cairine Logan
Dr. Logan is a senior lecturer in the Departments of Cell Biology and Anatomy and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology. She also serves as Director for the O’Brien Center for the Bachelor of Health Science Facility located within the Faculty of Medicine. She received her PhD in Medical and Molecular Genetics from the University of Toronto in 1993 and joined the University of Calgary as a faculty member in 1998. Dr. Logan has been involved in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program since its inception, responsible for developing and teaching MDSC 402, a third year, research intensive course within the Biomedical stream of the program and has recently taken over as course coordinator for the fourth year Honours Thesis and Research Communication course (MDSC 508) which serves as the capstone for all three streams. Her own research interests focus on two inter-related areas of developmental neurobiology: 1) pattern formation within the developing central nervous system of the vertebrate embryo (i.e. cerebellum) and 2) the ontogeny of distinct neuronal systems (i.e. cranial sensory system) and uses the chick embryo as a model system to explore both these issues.

Dr. Schryvers has been involved in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program since its inception in 2005, responsible for overseeing the laboratory facilities and serving as associate director of the program for two years.
