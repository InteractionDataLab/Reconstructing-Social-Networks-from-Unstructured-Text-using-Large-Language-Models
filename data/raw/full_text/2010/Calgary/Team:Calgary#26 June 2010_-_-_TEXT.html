Alberta Innovates Technology Fund Summer Workshop at University of Lethbridge, Day 1
Today, we drove down to the University of Lethbridge for the conference hosted by Alberta Innovates Technology Funds. We had workshops hosted by Joey Hundert on how to attract investors and sponsorships and by Erin Prefontaine on how to publicize our projects through the media. Bob Cooney, the Lethbridge media director, also gave us some tips on how to speak with the media. We were provided dinner in the form of a prime rib buffet at the Paradise Canyon Golf Resort.
