Today I did a restriction digest of the miniprepped plasmids with EcoRI and PstI. I also induced the CpxR system. Although due to misnomers with the shaker, the induction did not succeed. I will try that again next week. I also looked more into the araC promoter which might help us with our characterization.
Chris Today, Emily and I ran 1.0% agarose gels of each row of Emily's gigantic PCR of malEΔSS and malE31ΔSS. The gels can be seen on the right and it appears that the Pfx polymerase was most successful in bringing out malEΔSS and malE31ΔSS.
