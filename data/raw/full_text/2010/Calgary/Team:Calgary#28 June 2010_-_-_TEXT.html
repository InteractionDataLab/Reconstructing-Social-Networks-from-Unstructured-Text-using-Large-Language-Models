Jeremy
Discussion with Thane Kubik. Several changes made to the original project idea including replacing lock key with a more direct approach. No wet lab today.
Chris
Today, we had a discussion with Thane Kubik in which he went over some biological theory with us as well as going through our project with us. He also went through our lab protocols and attempted to troubleshoot as we have been having trouble with our transformations of DNA into competent cells. He gave us advice on changes that should be made to our project circuits as well as going through our basic modelling idea.
Patrick
I ran gels of the cpxP promoters and the R0040-E0430/R0040-E0420 constructs in 1.5% agarose.
