Second Life Study Day 2
Today, we went through the second part of the Second Life study designed to educate us about different elements of synthetic biology. We focused on reading recent articles in the news about synthetic biology and learning different perspectives that people held on the field. In particular, we looked at the article released today about the J. Craig Venter Institute's acccomplishment of the "creation of synthetic life".
