Friday May 28, 2010
Today, we spent more time learning HTML as well as CSS formating for our wiki. We continued research into our project idea of vanilla alcohol production by E. coli. We found several genes that were present as well as possible parts from the registry that could be used. Finally, we observed our construction again with the plasmids J13002 and E1010 on ampicillin plates.
