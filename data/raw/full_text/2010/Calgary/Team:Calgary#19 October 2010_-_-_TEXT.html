Jeremy's restriction enzyme digest using EcoRI and PstI on I13504+I0500+B0034, I13507+I0500+B0034, I13507+I0500+B0034+MalE3 and I13507, I13604 and I0500+B0034 as controls. As well a restriction enzyme digest of the sRFP sample.
Jeremy
Today I ran the gel of the restriction enzyme digested of the I13504+I0500+B0034, I13507+I0500+B0034, I13507+I0500+B0034+MalE31. Wells 1,6 and 11 are 1kb invitrogen ladders. Wells 2 and 3 contain variations of I13504+I0500+B0034, Wells 4,5,7 and 8 contain I13507+I0500+B0034+MalE31 samples and Wells 9 and 10 have I13507+I0500+B0034. Well 12 has I13507, well 13 has I13504, well 14 has I0500+B0034 and well 15 has sRFP. Data looks interesting, none of the pieces match the size however for the most part something is being cut out. If there is time to troubleshoot later I will try to see what I can do.
