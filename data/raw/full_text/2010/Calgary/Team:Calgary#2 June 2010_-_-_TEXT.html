Wednesday June 2, 2010
Today, we checked the plates containing the transformed plasmids from yesterday. We also spent time putting together presentations on the promoters and their respective systems to present on Friday. Patrick continued to fiddle with the wiki. Emily and Himika did suspension of the colonies of bacteria in overnight cultures that would be Miniprepped tomorrow.
