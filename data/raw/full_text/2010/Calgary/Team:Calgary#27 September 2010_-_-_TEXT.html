Himika
Today I was able to meet with Dr. Ray Turner from the Department of Biological Sciences. He was very helpful in assessing our project as well as able to tip us off on some of the details and terminology issues that we were having in the project. This would help us present at MIT and answer some of the questions that might arise.
