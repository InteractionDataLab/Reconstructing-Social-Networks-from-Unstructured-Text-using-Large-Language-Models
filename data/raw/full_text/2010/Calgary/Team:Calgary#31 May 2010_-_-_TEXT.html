Monday May 31, 2010
Today, we met and did research into various funding exercises that we could do as well as ethics proposals. We began our good copy of the sponsorship proposal of which we would distribute to companies. For the ethics component, we began getting in contact with the Suffield Research and Defense facility that specializes in research with chemical and biological weapons. Finally, we had a discussion of our project ideas with Dr. Anthony Schryvers (Associate Dean of Medicine at University of Calgary) where he suggested the use of the lux system as an indicator for protein folding instead of a split GFP mechanism. One member of our group, Patrick, began learning how to use Autodesk Maya as a modelling tool as well as beginning the coding of our team wiki.
