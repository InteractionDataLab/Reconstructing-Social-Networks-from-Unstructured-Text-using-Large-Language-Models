Emily
Today I PCR purified malE and malE31.  I then set up a digest of these, plus the psB1AK3 with a combination of enzymes: both EcoRI/SpeI and XbaI/PstI.  This is to try to get the linearized PCR product into the AK BBK Construction plasmid.  I then transformed these into TOP10 cells and plated them on AK plates.  Today we also had a meeting in order to finalize some details for the iGEM class as well as for our presentation at aGEM.

Today I miniprepped pSB2K3, MalE31 circuits. I also constructed MalE31 circuits with the CpxR circuits. This circuit is important in order to induce the MalE31 circuit using arabinose and also characterization of the CpxR promoter. I also transformed MalE31 circuit in CpxR competent top 10 cells. This will be used as an alternate way of testing and characterization of the CpxR system. I also did further research into the relationship of pH and hydropathy in inclusion body formation. We also had a meeting in order to figure out the course content for iGEM.
Chris
Today, I continued contacting companies about getting sponsorship for our team. We have now made contact with most of who we expect to be as our main sponsors. We also had a meeting where we updated our professors Dr. Logan and Dr. Schryvers about how our project has been progressing as w ell as finalizing the details for the iGEM class.
