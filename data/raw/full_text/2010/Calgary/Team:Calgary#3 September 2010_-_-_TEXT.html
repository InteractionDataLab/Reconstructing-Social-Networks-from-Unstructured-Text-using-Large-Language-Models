Chris's gel of MalE Colonys 4 and 5 in Lanes 1-2 and Jeremy's PCR Gel Extraction DNA in Separate lanes on right.
Chris
Today, I reran the gel that was overrun yesterday and the results are shown to the right. The second well of MalE (Lane 2) was sent for sequencing and the right two lanes were so separate due to the need for a gel extraction. For the rest of the day, I attempted to call more companies for sponsorships.
