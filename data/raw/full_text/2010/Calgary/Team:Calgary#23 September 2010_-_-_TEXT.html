Himika
Today I constructed and transformed CpxR-I13504 and MalE31 circuit again because Dr. Schryvers suggested that MalE31 circuit and CpxR circuit should have a terminator between them. Therefore I reconstructed those two together.I also got a response from one of the BCEM profs with referrals to some of the other BCEM profs. I sent the other profs the email as well.

Today I did a plasmid prep of the colonies of the attempted construction of K239000-I13507 and K239000-I13504 stress reporter devices.
