Chris's restriction digest of random CpxP that Emily miniprepped/ Results are inconclusive
Weekends are awesome!! 1 week to aGEM!
Chris
Today, I ran a restriction digest of a bunch of the CpxP promoters that Emily miniprepped and ran them on a 1.0% gel. The results can be seen on the right. There are no real conclusive results so they were redigested and the gel will be run tomorrow. I also did plasmid preparations of a bunch of overnight cultures of ibpAB and CpxP that were set up yesterday.
Emily
This evening I helped Chris with miniprpeps of various cultues from yesterday.  I also set up a colony PCR of new malESSdel colonies as well as malE and malE31 colonies.
