Patrick
Assigned and obtained various paragraphs from other team members.  Uploaded many on the Wiki.
Emily
Set up digests of cpxP, malE, malESSdel, I0500-I13507, K135000-I13507-I0500-B0034-malE31 and the psB1AC3 vector.  This is to plasmid switch all of the remianing registry parts into the accepted shipping plasmid.  After construction and Antarctic Phosphotase treatment, I ligated them and then transformed them into TOP10 Competant E. Coli cells and then innocultaed LB broth culture and left the cultures to grow overnight.  Today I also preparted ovenright cultures for an arabinose induction in order to get some more characterizatuon data of the I0500 (arabinose inducible) promoter.  I also entered our parts into the Registry of Standard Biological Prats in preparation for shipping tomorrow.
Himika
Today I uploaded a whole bunch of wiki contents. I also subcultured and induced DegP cells containing MalE and MalE31 with 12 different arabinose concentrations. I also helped emily with a bunch of plasmid switches that failed before.
