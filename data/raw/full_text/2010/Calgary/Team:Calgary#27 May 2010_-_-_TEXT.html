Thursday May 27, 2010
Today, we used the GenElute kit to harvest our plasmids without the DNA binding dye that was present in the kit sent by the Registry. We then used these and redid our construction of J13002 and E1010. After that, we spent the afternoon learning HTML format and CSS coding format as well as doing more research into our project ideas.
