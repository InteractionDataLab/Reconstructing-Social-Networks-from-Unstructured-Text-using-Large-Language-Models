Alberta Innovates Technology Fund Summer Workshop at University of Lethbridge, Day 2
Today, we spent the day at the University of Lethbridge for the second day of the Alberta Innovates Technology Funds Summer Workshop. There was a presentation workshop in the morning by Anne Marie Downey where we were taught techniques on how to speak to the judges at the iGEM presentation. In the afternoon, each of the three teams present had a one hour troubleshooting session with Andrew Hessel where he listened to the project ideas and gave his opinion or any recommended changes that could be made.
