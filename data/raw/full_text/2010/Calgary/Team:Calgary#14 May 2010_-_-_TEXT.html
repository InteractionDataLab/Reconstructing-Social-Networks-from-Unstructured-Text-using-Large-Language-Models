Friday May 14, 2010
Today, we observed the plates from which the R0040 GFP part was added into competent cells under UV light. With that light, the Green fluorescent protein should be much more visible. The plates with ampicillin showed large quantities of growth while the plates with kanamycin had no growth whatsoever. We grew them on both plates because we were unsure which antibiotic resistance the R0040 GFP part contained. With this knowledge, we confirmed that the Competent cells as well as the GFP R0040 GFP were functional. In the future, we would confirm the part was present through PCR and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis. For the rest of the day, we continued research into our topics that we had narrowed the project list down to.
