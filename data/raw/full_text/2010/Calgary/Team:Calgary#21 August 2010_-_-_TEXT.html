Yay for weekends!
Chris's gel of CpxP, ibpAB, I13507, and I13504 Restriction Digests. There are very messy bands and these digests will not be used for construction.
Chris
Today, I ran restriction digests of I13504, I13507, ibpAB, pSB1AK3, CpxP and pSB1AC3. They were once again run on a gel, which can be seen on the right (CpxP in Lanes 1-3, ibpAB in Lanes 4 and 5, I13504 and I13507 in lanes 6 and 7, and the vectors in lanes 8 and 9. As well, I set up a colony PCR with MalE31,MalE, K239000-I13504, K239000-13507, and I0500-I13507. The results of that colony PCR will be run on a gel tomorrow.
