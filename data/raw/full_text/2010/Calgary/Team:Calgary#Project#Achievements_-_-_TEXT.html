Please see our
Parts page here .
Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry of Parts
Silver Medal Requirements
Demonstrate that one of your parts works as expected
Using various methods of characterization, we confirmed that our CpxR reporter circuit was functional. In adition, our maltose binding protein (MalE) and mutant maltose binding protein (MalE31) were shown to be functional. Click here for more information.
Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information on the Parts or Device page via the Registry of Parts
The CpxR reporter, MalE31, and MalE were shown to be functional through characterization. Click here for more information.
Gold Medal Requirements
Characterize or improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Registry
More characterization was given to the Registry of Standard Parts for the cpxR promoter as well as for the degP promoter.  Details can be found on our characterization page here .
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system
We tested out a part (nms6) for the University of Lethbridge.  We assayed it for possible misfolding in the cytoplasm.  Results can be found here .
We attended an Alberta-wide conference where teams from the University of Calgary, the University of Lethbridge, and the University of Alberta did mock presentations, gave each other future directions, and gave possible troubleshooting methods.
We filled out surveys for the University of Warsaw and the University of Edinburgh iGEM teams
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation
We chose to use current social media in the form of podcasts which covered different ethical issues pertaining to synthetic biology. These are posted here . In addition to this, an analysis of the social, ethical, and economical factors which our project dealt with was written and is posted here
