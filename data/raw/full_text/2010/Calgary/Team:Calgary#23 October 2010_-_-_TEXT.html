Emily
Today I set up a massive colony PCR with the BBK-CP primers in order to veirfy that we were able to get all of our parts into the psB1C3 vector.  Today I also made more LB broth.  I also did transformations of a few other parts into the psB1C3 vector as well as the construction of I0500-B0034 with the Lethbridge part.

Today I set subcultured the DegP cells containing MalE and MalE31 into 20 ml broth and allowed it to grow for 6 hours. I induced these cells with 15 different arabinose concentrations. This was left shaking overnight and I will read these cells tomorrow.
