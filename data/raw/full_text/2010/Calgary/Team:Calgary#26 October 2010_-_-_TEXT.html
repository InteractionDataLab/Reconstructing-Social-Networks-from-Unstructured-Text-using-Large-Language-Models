Final touches of the wiki being done by every member of the team. Uploaded the Maya animation.
Emily
Today I miniprepped our overnight cultures of our parts for the registry in the psB1AC3 vector and I shipped this off to the Registry.  Today I also set up ovenright cultures for three final inductions: I0500-I13504, ibpAB-I13504 and I0500-B0034-mns6.
Himika
Today I did a lot of writeups for the wiki and I also did the final readings of DegP competent cells with MalE and MalE31. The data still needs to be interpreted and uploaded on to the wiki. We also sent off our final parts to MIT.
