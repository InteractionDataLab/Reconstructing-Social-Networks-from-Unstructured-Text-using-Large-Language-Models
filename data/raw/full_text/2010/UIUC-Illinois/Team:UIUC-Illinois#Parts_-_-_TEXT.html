Parts
New for iGEM 2010 is the groupparts tag.  This tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.
<groupparts>iGEM010 UIUC-Illinois</groupparts>
Please see the linked Parts Registry pages for more information on each part.
