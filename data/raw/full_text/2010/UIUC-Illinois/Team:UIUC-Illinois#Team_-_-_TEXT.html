What we did
This year, the University of Illinois Bioware Team worked with genes from Salmonella and E. coli to create a bioremediation system that removes arsenic and gold from solution.  We also improved upon the bacterial decoder project from last year, and worked to incorporate the two projects.  More information can be found on our Project page.
Where we're from
