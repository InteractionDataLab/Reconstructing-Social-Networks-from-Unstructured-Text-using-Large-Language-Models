Go iGEM
no
good luck!
Good Luck!!!!!
Maybe you should provide some brief outline of what synthetic biology is to give a little bit of context to the questions.
nope.
Good luck guys!
Why is there a "star" background? Why not  the DNA helix?
I hope this helps you to know that I don't know much about synthetic biology and look forward to hearing about it in the future.
I have a vague idea of what synthetic biology is, but really I have no idea.
GO IGEM WOO
Its difficult to do this quiz without any knowledge about synthetic biology.
The next time you see Amanda Chang, look at her and say "STOP, only I may dance."

go synth bio!
have a great day! :)
I wish you guys the best of luck at iGEM!
Hope this was helpful!
I don't really know about any of the things asked.
Sorry I don't really understand synthetic biology.
I don't know a lot about science, which is too bad because it is so important because it can make such drastic changes in people's lives.
Yay science!
I really want to know what synthetic biology is now.
Good luck with your projects and bringing your ideas to fruition!
