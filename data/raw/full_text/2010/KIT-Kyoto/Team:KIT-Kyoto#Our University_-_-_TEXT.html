Kyoto Institute of Technology (KIT)
Our University KIT is one of the National Universities located in Matsugasaki Kyoto, Japan.
KIT has ten departments covering three academic fields such as Materials and life science, Engineering design and Design science.
We got interested in the poster presented in iGEM by Tokyo Institute of Technology at summer school of biological science held in Japan.
And decided to participate in iGEM 2010.
To make our iGEM team KIT-Kyoto, We got contact with some iGEM team in Japan and collected many information of iGEM 2010.
Philosophy in making our team is a combination of biology and design.
Therefore we have 2 students from design engineering department and ○ students from applied biology department in our iGEM team.
Our expectations and hope for iGEM 2010 are 3 points.
①We would like to promote better understanding and interest for biology through activity in iGEM 2010.
②We would like to discuss with many students all over the world, and we would like to make friends with all around the world.
③Our University, Kyoto Institute of Technology, KIT is not so large and famous enough, so we wanna make it world wide famous by achievement of brilliant results at iGEM 2010
