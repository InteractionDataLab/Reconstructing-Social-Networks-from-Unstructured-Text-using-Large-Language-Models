We are students of '''KIT'''-''Kyoto Institute of Technology''.
Our University KIT is one of the National Universities located in Matsugasaki Kyoto, Japan. Kyoto is a very famous city of Japan.It had been Japanese capital for over millenium, and its history has built up its unique, traditional culture.    KIT has ties with this traditional culture and industries in Kyoto and has been advancing knowledge in engineering, design, and textile science. By pursuing ‘human-friendly practical science,’ KIT and its two predecessors have been serving our society for over a century.   KIT has Drosophila Genetic Resource Center(DGRC). The DGRC collects Drosophila stocks from laboratories all over the world, maintains them, and provides them to researchers upon request. There are only three Drosophila resorce center in the world !  Drosophila is an essential model organism for life science research as a result of its long-term use in genetic research.  KIT has great achievements in this genetic field.  And, KIT has departments not only of science but also of arts. It is rare in Japanese national universities! So KIT has philosophy that we will develop an academic community, which aspires to the fusion of science and art cultivated from the foundation of KIT.  So it is no doubt that KIT is the best university to participate iGEM projects!    KIT encourages students to participate in internships, experience the realm where design and science converge and take part in projects with our partner universities abroad. KIT also promotes collaboration in business and research with industries. The close rapport maintained with area industries over the past 100 years has allowed us to continue to have our fingers on the pulse of Kyoto design and technology.   Finally, KIT financially supports our team.
