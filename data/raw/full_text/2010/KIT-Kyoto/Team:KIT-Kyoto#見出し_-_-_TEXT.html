Lab Note
We started our experiment on August 10th.
Open the page, as you can see, our experiment notebooks are written in Japanese. We tried hard to report the experiment in more detail than any other team. This is why we decided to explain in Japanese.
If you understand Japanese, and if you don't have any knowledge about iGEM rule, you can get a lot of information through reading our notebooks. Our notebook will contribute to JAPAN in future.
