E.coli Pen Design
We tried to model the E.coli pen by investigating and surveying conventional pens on the market. We dissected the pens and observed their structures in detail. We made computer graphic (CG) of the pen using CAD methodologies to optimize the design of the pen we propose. We show screenshots of these CG's later.
