Our Sponsors
Our group, the “KIT-Kyoto", has looked for sponsors interested in our iGEM project and who could cooperate with its economic aspect. We have thus asked for economic support to more than 50 companies, among which there were not only biotechnology companies, but also companies with a strong foothold in Kyoto. To our enjoyment and satisfaction three of them, AMTEC , Kankyo Eisei Yakuhin , and Sansyodoh agreed to cooperate with us. Furthermore, our university KIT , KIT-venture laboratory , and KIT-OBOG financially supported us. From the bottom of our hearts, we really appreciated them.One way of expressing our appreciation was publishing our sponsor’s links and logo marks on this iGEM homepage, as well as printing their logo marks on our uniforms .

We have already begun preparations for the next iGEM competition. If you are interested in our project, and you’d like to cooperate with us becoming our sponsor, please contact us by sending an e-mail to Prof. Yamaguchi (myamaguchi at kit.ac.jp). We welcome not only Japanese domestic companies, but also overseas companies. And, if you have any questions or remarks about our project, please let us know by sending an e-mail to wiki's leader Adachi (adbc963yk at gmail.com). We are looking forward to meeting and contacting you !
