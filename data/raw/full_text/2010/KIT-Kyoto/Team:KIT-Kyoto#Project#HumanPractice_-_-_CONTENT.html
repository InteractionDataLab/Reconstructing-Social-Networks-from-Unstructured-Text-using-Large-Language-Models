Japan suffers of a similar alienation that poses a barrier towards further advancement of science and technology. In biology, genetic modification epitomizes the magnitude of this problem among people who regard synthetic technologies and sciences as “something strange”, or “something dangerous” in general. Whereas genetically modified foods are sold on the counter, consumers don't pick or choose food with labels. This results from the scarcity or lack of information on genetic modification on the part of the general public. Since a more rapid advancement of the field of life sciences is expected in the near future leading to more complicated technologies, information and communication will also become critical.  Moreover, while we benefit from technology, this is increasingly becoming “a black box”. Unknown technology is not familiar any longer.
</DD><DD>Accordingly, to let people in Japan and in the world know about more information of genetic modification, we tried activities below.

In this booth, we introduced iGEM and our activities. To make the lecture simple, we tried to avoid using technical terms.
</DD><DD>Besides, we displayed model organisms genetically modified, for example, <I>Yeast</I>, <I>Silkworm</I>, <I>Drosophila</I> and <I>E.coli</I>.  Students could touch the <I>silkworms</I> and see <I>Drosophila</I> mutants, both organisms were genetically modified. We aimed to make their understanding clear, and make them have a feeling of familiarity for genetic modification.
</DD><DD>There were about 200 students who came to our booth. They told us that their ideas and conceptions about biology were broadened by looking closely at the model organisms.

In addition to the August one, we displayed a specimen of our so called “<I>E.Coli</I> Pen”. Students could draw with this pen, and have a close contact with synthetic biology. Having them appreciate the subtle connection between art and science has been an enlightening feed-back for our group, since we have been able to observe and judge the aspects of human reaction towards the new and the unknown, when information is fully supplied about the particular phenomenon or technology. They have learned and enjoyed the harmony that can exist between Science and Art.

The purpose of this organization is to make of iGEM a more active enterprise fueled by inter-group cooperation. The main member teams constituting iGEM are Osaka , Kyoto, Tokyo Metropolitan , UT-Tokyo, Tokyo Tech, Sapporo and our KIT-Kyoto. So far, the organization has performed various activities, for example, contributing an article to a magazine, holding pre competition conferences and meetings in Japan, and others.
</DD><DD>As a part of our activities, we conducted a survey widely targeted to public ranging from high school students to citizens in general. The objective of the survey was to find how Japanese people feel or think about synthetic biology and its problems like bioethics or safety. We asked people who came not only from biology departments but also from various fields of study. We also asked visitors at the open campus mentioned above. Furthermore, we made it able to answer from iGEM Japan’s website so that we could collect the answer from various classes.

The data show that more than half of the whole respondents think that it is necessary to continue the research on gene manipulation techniques and biotechnology. But, the data also show that most people do not want to buy GM foods or want to avoid buying medicines made by recombinant DNA. Moreover, they totally have a negative image on gene manipulation techniques.</DD></DL><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Discussion"> Discussion </SPAN></H4><DL><DD>It seems that lots of Japanese people have a vague sense of repulsion against gene recombination. On the other hand, a certain proportion of people answered that we should continue to research about gene manipulation, and they think that we can apply the gene manipulation techniques to global food problem or the medical progress. This result indicates that a certain amount of people have knowledge about gene manipulation techniques. But, lots of people have bad impression against it because of the effects of mass media. As a result, Japanese people have mixture of contradictory feelings between acceptance and repulsion against gene manipulation techniques. It is likely that such a situation was caused by the vagueness about gene manipulation techniques.</DD></DL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Help_to_other_new_Japanese_teams_in_the_future"> Help to other new Japanese teams in the future </SPAN></H2><DL><DD>　We decided to make not only English Lab notes but also more detailed Lab notes in Japanese, and to show them in wiki this time. The reason why we present the Lab notes in Japanese in slightly more detail is because we think that the Lab notes must be precise. In fact, it is very well established that Lab notes must be accurate, and must bear a high degree of detail so that it can enable the reproduction of an experiment. This is a very important requirement for Lab notes. However, previous iGEM teams, particularly non-English teams, show lack of important entries or errors in the expressions of Lab notes. It is a fact that even in our group there are few members complying with these pre-established rules. So, we judged convenient to write the Lab note in our native language “Japanese” in pursuit of the accomplishment of the rules and comply with the highest accuracy possible. Moreover, we have uploaded not only the English protocol but also the Japanese one, e.g., our mother tongue version. This is the common protocol with some improvements after we translated it into Japanese. Publishing the Japanese protocol in will be of help to other new Japanese teams in the future. We believe that these notes and protcol will be not only of help to Japanese teams participating in future iGEM's but will constitute standards leading to exact reproducibility of the experiments.  </DD><DD><A href="https://2010.igem.org/Team:KIT-Kyoto/Notebook" class="external text" rel="nofollow">&gt;&gt;Go to &quot;Lab Note&quot;</A></DD></DL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Collaborating_with_other_iGEM_teams"> Collaborating with other iGEM teams </SPAN></H2><P>We actively participated to survey by other iGEM team.
