Wiki Design
We have done our best to make our wiki's design simple enough so that anyone can easily understand our projects and perhaps easily edit our wiki. We have designed the size and color of the characters and tried to give it a good visualization aspect. The members of the wiki's team met and discussed about the design on a daily basis at school. So everyone was able to see it at home, after school hours. We also inquired for other member's opinions about our wiki at regular meetings and tried to improve our wiki with their recommendations.
