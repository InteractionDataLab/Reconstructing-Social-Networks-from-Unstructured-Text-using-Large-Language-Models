Check to see if digestion visualization Primers Work
Electrophoresis after restriction enzyme digestion‎
All 4 of PCR products were purified via Microcon YM-10

Promoter
Promoter band in lane 6 wasn't visible
This vector didn't have a primer annealing site for our new primers
Check of Ligation Mixtures
TAKARABIO's Ligation Mixture [I] and Ligation Mixture Mighty Mix [M]
After PCR and gel extracted pSB1C3 volume of either Ligation Mixture equal to pSB1C3 solution volume was added
Transformed
incubated in 200 uL of LB medium
100 uL of each solution was plated on mediums containing 34 ug/uL and 12 ug/uL of chloramphenicol
Various Checks
Electrophoresis to check if various DNA manipulations were successful

7
Gel extracted pSB1C3
Band weren't visible in lane 3
Dimers, trimers and etc were hardly visible maybe severely diluted
In lane 7 had detectable by very weak band
There weren't any problems with gel extraction
