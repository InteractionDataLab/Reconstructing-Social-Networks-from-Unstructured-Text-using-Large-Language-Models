3 piece ligation, continued
Yesterday after purification by gel extraction electrophoresis showed very weak bands
This time increased PCR cycles to 40
Everything else was same as last time
But again it was a failure
Thought that template went bad，so used PCR Product as template
Extension was 90 sec, did 30 cycles
