Single Colony Isolation
Observed if any colonies were made
Could not see 3-1E
Number of other colonies on other plates was also very small
Mistake in protocol is inferred
Precipitation of cells maybe at fault
All but 3-1E was moved to new plates
PCR Reaction System
Reaction system was prepared for 3 parts, 245 uL in total
Reagent
Amount
Autoclaved DW
165 uL
10x PCR buffer
25 uL
2 mM dNTPs
25 uL
25 mM MgSO4
15 uL
EX-F primer
5 uL
PS-R primer
5 uL
KOD plus Neo
5 uL
Total
245 uL
49 uL of reaction solution was added to each of 4 tubes and after DNA template was added
Length of each template is listed int the table below
Tube
Biobrick
Length
1
2-24G （sender）
847 bp
2
1-2M （RBS）
61 bp
3
1-23L （terminator）
178 bp
4
3-1E （heat sensor）
984 bp
Template DNA length is calculated by adding prefix and suffix length
Biobrick Length + Prefix length + Suffix Length
Because Mini prep of 3-1E failed, it amplified by PCR
PCR program
Predenature
94℃ 2 min
Denature
98℃ 10 sec
Extension
68℃ 30 sec
Hold
4℃
30 cycles
KOD potency is 30 sec/kbp, so 30 sec for １ cycle
Electrophoresis
Electrophoresis of amplified BioBricks
Added 1 uL of 6xSample Buffer to 5 uL of amplified DNA
Used marker pUC119/Hinf1
Added 20 uL of EtBr to 1/2 TBE
Lane
DNA
Length of DNA
1
pUC119/Hinf1
2
2-24G （sender）
847 bp
3
1-2M （RBS）
61 bp
4
1-23L （terminator）
178 bp
5
3-1E （heat sensor）
984 bp
