Parts in wells 1-14K and pSB1A3 were purified with mycrocon. Part 1-23L was extracted from a gel previously.
Performed electrophoresis of 1-14K and 1-23L to estimate concentration of each solution.
Estimated concentration from photo of electrophoresis
pSB1A3 solution was done by other person.
Made digestion recipes(below) based on estimated concentrations
Made 30 ul of pSB1A3 solution, but latter found it insufficient to ligate parts
made more 50ul of it after
Part Well No.

Incubated each solution at 37C
Solution of 1-23L was incubated for 150 min
Solution of 1-14K was incubated for 90 min
30 ul of pSB1A3 solution was incubated for 60 min
50 ul of pSB1A3 solution was incubated for 30 min
Performed electrophoresis for each solution
put 12 uls each into wells of a gel like below.

Results
Could not see bands of 1-23L because leaked out
Drove current for too long
Extracted the other samples from a gel using promega kit
Stored all at -20C.
