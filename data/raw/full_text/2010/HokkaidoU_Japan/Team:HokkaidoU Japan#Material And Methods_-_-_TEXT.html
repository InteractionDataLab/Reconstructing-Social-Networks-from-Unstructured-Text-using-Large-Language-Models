Methods
Type III secretion system RK13 cell Injection Assay
Seed RK13 cells
Remove the culture medium and wash 3 times PBS followed by trypsinization
Suspend RK13 cells with antibiotics free RPMI-10% FCS
Seed 6 x 105/well RK13 on the 6 well plate coated with poly-L-Lysin 24 hrs before infection
Prepare E. coli culture
Grow E. coli K12 (SPI2/Signal-GFP), E. coli K12 (SPI2) and E. coli K12 (Signal-GFP) in 4 mL of LB (+0.4% Arabinose) with appropriate antibiotics at 37C overnight
5 hrs before injection
Centrifuge 4 mL of E. coli culture at 3,500 rpm for 10 min in the round tube
Discard the supernatant and resuspend with 4 mL of MgM-MES(pH 5.0) + 0.4% Arabinose with appropriate antibiotics and grow at 37C for 4 hrs
4 hrs later centrifuge the culture 3,500 rpm for 10 min and discard the sup
Resuspend the pellet with 2 mL of antibiotics free RPMI-10% FCS and transfer the culture into micro tube
Centrifuge the culture 6,000 rpm for 3 min and discard the sup
Repeat step 4 and 5 three times
Measure and adjust the concentration of E. coli RPMI culture (ΔOD = 0.5)
Injection
Remove the RPMI on RK13
Add 900 uL of fresh RPMI-10% FCS and then 100 uL of E. coli RPMI culture (ΔOD = 0.5)
Incubate the plate at 37C for 1 hrs, 5% CO2 with or without shaking
Wash the wells with penisilin/ strepromicin containing RPMI-10% FCS twice
Add 2 mL of penisilin/ streptomicin containing RPMI-10% FCS/well
Incubate the plate at 37C for 1 hr, 5% CO2
Observe the cells by fluorescence microscope under blue light at every 30 min
