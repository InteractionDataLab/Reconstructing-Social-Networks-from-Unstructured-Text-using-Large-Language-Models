Colony PCR
Checked if  primers PS-R, EX-F were good to use for colony PCR and also checked if insert was realy in plasmids
September 6th transformation (digestion was done with H buffer×２ and M buffer×２, 2 version)
1-3A
Retried September 6th transformation
pUC119
Confirmation of pSB1C3
Because pSB1C3 PCRed from 1-3A（RFP reporter） was used there was posibility of contamination by template which would also produce red colonies.
H buffer treated 2 uL ＋ Mighty Mix 2 uL ＋ T4 ligase 0.5 uL → Ligation → Transformation
M buffer treated 2 uL ＋ Mighty Mix 2 uL ＋ T4 ligase 0.5 uL → Ligation → Transformation
H buffer treated 2 uL → Transformation
M buffer treated 2 uL → Transformation
PCR of GFP
GFP reporter BBa_I13522 pSB1A2 2-8A 937 bp
GFP protein BBa_E0840 pSB1A2 1-12O 878 bp
PCR cocktail was same as September 1st's
