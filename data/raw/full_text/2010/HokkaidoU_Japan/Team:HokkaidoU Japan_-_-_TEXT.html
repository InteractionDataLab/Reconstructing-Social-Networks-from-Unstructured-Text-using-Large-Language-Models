Projects
Dr. E. coli : The smallest protein injector in the world
   Our main project is on Type III Secretion Apparatus which is one of the most amazing biological devices. This apparatus which looks like a syringe can pass a whole protein molecule from a bacterial cell to a target eukaryotic cell. However, this apparatus is an organelle of pathogenic gram-negative bacterium such as Salmonella and Yersinia. So we are aiming at making this device safely available using E. coli.
PCR Based Assembly Protocol
   Sometimes standard protocol fails to produce plasmid or BioBrick is toxic to host cell and can't be amplified. In moments like these PCR is handy. We think we might slightly improved it. You no longer have to guess if restriction was successful.
Team
   The Hokkaido University's igem 2010 team, HokkaidoU_Japan is Japans 8th Our has one instructer and 7 undergrad students.They come from faculty of Sciences, Medicine and Agriculture. This is the first year we are participating in iGEM.
Notebook
    The record of our triumphs and failures. Well big part of it is failures. But we did it.
Protocols
    General protocols we used.
Parts
   We registered two parts associated with main project. One is a signal sequence that can be used to secrete tagged proteins through Type III Secretion Apparatus. The other is whole reporter construct to checks whether the Type III secretion system works correctly.
   Also, we registerd one primer set which is useful for the PCR based protocol.
Safety
   Addressing bio safety concerns
