Electrophoresis of Yesterday Samples
electrophoresed 6 uL Marker λ/HindIII EcoRI and 1 uL of two yesterday samples.T3SS signal wasn't observed.
Electrophoresis of concentrated GFP-double terminator(T3SS signal wasn't seen)
Colony PCR of Arabinose Promoter + RBS + GFP + double terminator
PCRed 5 colony.

erectrophoresed the samples.Marker is 10 uL λ/HindIII EcoRI.
Electrophoresis of colony PCR sample
Cultivation of colony
cultivated the colonies which were used for PCR.Each Samples were cultured in LB contained Ampicillin and 20% Arabinose or contained only Ampicillin.
PCR of T3SS signal again
We thought colony PCR can't use KOD plus neo.We did a PCR with KOD plus neo again,and also did with Quick Taq.

Electrophoresed the samples and pSB1C3 and pSB1T3 which were amplified before.A band of T3SS signal amplified by Quick Taq was observed, but by KOD plus neo wasn't done.Estimated a concentration of T3SS signal and plasmid.
