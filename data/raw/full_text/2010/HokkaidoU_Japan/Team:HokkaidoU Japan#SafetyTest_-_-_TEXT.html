Safety
The strains of E. coli that we have generated in the course of this project are not likely to cause disease or other bio-safety problems under standard laboratory conditions. None of the parts that we have generated in our project have a high inherent bio-safety risk, though it is conceivable that these parts could be used to along proteins that themselves have bio-safety issues. Therefore we stress that users of this technology verify that human risks from expressed proteins are minimal.

Secretion System
Our work on Type 3 Secretion System was done without involving live Salmonella bacteria. We used 2 BAC library fragments from Salmonella's DNA which was obtained from Salmonella Genetic Stock Centre (SGSC) following required procedures. These 2 fragments of salmonella genome is inserted in BAC Vector which is contained in E.Coli strain MG1655. Our instructor obtained appropriate permit from our universities safety officer of genetic recombinantion.  These E.Coli were acknowledged as non-pathogenic and permitted to be used under P1 safety level. However due to material transfer agreement between our laboratory and SGSC we can’t submit  Type 3 Secretion Apparatus (Syringe part of Type 3 Secretion System) to BioBrick Registry.
