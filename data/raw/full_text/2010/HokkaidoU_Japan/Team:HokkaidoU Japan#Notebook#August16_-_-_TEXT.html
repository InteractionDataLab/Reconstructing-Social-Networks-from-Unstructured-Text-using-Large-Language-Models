Made solution for each EcoR I, Xba I, Pst I
incubated at 37C for 60 min

pUC119 doesn't have Spe I restriction sites, so we used mini preped plasmid with biobrick insert
incubated at 37C for 60 min
Control
Added 1 uL of 6x Sample Buffer to 1 uL of pUC119
Also added 1 uL of 6x Sample Buffer to 1 uL of 1-1A
Incubated at 37C for 60 min
Electrophoresis
Electrophoresis of digested DNA
Added 2 uL of 6x Sample Buffer to digested solution and performed electrophoresis

It was obvious after restriction enzyme activity check that Spe I was week, so additional 0.7 uL was added
