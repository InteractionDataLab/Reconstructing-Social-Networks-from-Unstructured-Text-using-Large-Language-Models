1-3A 12
yes
1-3A had colonies in lated on mediums containing 34 ug/uL of chloramphenicol
So the medium and antibiotic consentration seems ok,
Medium on which M 12 was plated was inoculated with chloramphenicol after solidification so there were some irregularities and colonies on the fringe
Colonies of 1-3A and 12 were obviously different
→ So we suspected issues in Ligation and DNA concentration bused for transformation
Estimation of 1-3A Consentration
Electrophoresis of 1uL of 1-3A DNA
Added 1 uL of 1-3A into 30 uL of competent cells
Transformation was successful
Electrophoresed 1 uL of 1-3A ，calculated amount of transformed DNA
→Estimated concentration 2 ng/uL
Ethanol precipitation of pSB1C3 and Ligation
Ethanol precipitation
Added 8.2 uL of sodium acetate [3 M]
Added 205 uL of Ethanol [100%] and mixed
Centrifuge at 15000rpm, 4C for 10 min
Discarded supernatant and added 500 uL of Ethanol [70%], mixed
Centrifuge at 15000rpm, 4C for 5 min
Discarded supernatant
Dried via vacuum desiccator
Added 8.2 uL of ADW
Concentration increased 10 fold
Ligation
Mixed 8.2 uL of DNA solution with the same volume of Ligation Solution
Added extra 1 uL of T4 ligase
Incubated at 16C for 30 min
Tomorrow will do aditional Electrophoresis gel extraction and transformation
Digestion of PCR products amplified using digestion visualization primers
Electrophoresis after digestion, differences in length is visible
Calculated the concentration of DNA amplified yesterday
