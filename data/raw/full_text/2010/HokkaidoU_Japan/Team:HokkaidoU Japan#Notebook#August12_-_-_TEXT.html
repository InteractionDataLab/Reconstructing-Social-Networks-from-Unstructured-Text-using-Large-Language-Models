Electrophoresis 1
Electrophoresis of yesterdays ligation of PCR products
Checked the result of yesterdays ligation of PCR products by electrophoresis
Added 4 uL of 6x Sample Buffer to make 12 uL in total
Used 20 uL of EtOH
Mini prep
Used cells incubated for 18h in LB broth
1-18F didn't grow well
Centrifuge after adding 430 uL of chloroform、collected supernatant
Added 2-propanol to 1-18F , but after centrifugation there were no precipitation
Melted in 30 uL of TE and did electrophoresis
Electrophoresis 2
Take 1
Take 2 after few minutes
Checked plasmids gathered via mini prep and PCR products, by electrophoresis.
Because we wont do restriction enzyme digestion reaction system is ass follows.

Used markers are λ/HindIII and pUC119/HinfI
Marker in lane 1 ( λ/HindIII ) leaked out
Mini prep sample，1-18F band in lane 3 wasn't visible so we decided PCR it tomorrow
In lane 4 there were some visible plasmid dimers and trimer s
