Ligation and transformation follows same protocol as previously
Competency Check
Transfered 1 uL of pUC119 DNA (0.35 ug/uL) into 0.5 mL tube and added 2.5 uL of ADW (0.1 ug/uL)
Took new 1.5 mL tube and added 999 uL of ADW (0.1 ng/uL) to it plus 1 uL of [1]
Took new 1.5 mL tube and added 99 uL of ADW to it plus 1 uL of [2]
Added pUC119 DNA (1 pg/uL) to each DH5alpha tube of 50ul and 30ul also varying the amount of pUC119 DNA:1 uL, 10 uL, 100 uL
Transformed
Ligation and Transformation between Vector，Transformation
Because there weren't any colonies the previous day we suspected that there might be something wrong with vectors
Mixed 2 uL of pSB1C3, 2 uL of ligation solution and 0.4 uL of T4 ligase
Transformed
