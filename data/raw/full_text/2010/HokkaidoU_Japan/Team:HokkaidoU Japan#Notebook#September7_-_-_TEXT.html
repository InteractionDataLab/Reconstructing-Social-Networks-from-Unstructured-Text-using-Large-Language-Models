Checked concentration of DNA used yesterday for ligation
4 ng/uL RFP digested using either H buffer and M buffer
pSB1C3 band was very week
Ethanol precipitation
In accordance to Mighty Mix default protocol that for ligation DNA must melted in TE and for concentrating it more Ethanol precipitation was done.
Colony PCR of competent cells
Previous colony PCR produced strange bands so checked if there were from DNA of competent cell
Colony PCR didn't produce any bands so those bands had to be an artifact from plasmid used for transformation
