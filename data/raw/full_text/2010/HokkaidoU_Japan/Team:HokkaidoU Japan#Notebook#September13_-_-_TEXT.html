araC promoter purification
Electrophoresed for gel extraction
Compared to marker band was a little lower than it should. Thinking that this was due to too big an amount, gel extracted anyway.
Used TSUDA marker
Part length is 1259 bp
Electrophoresed after gel extraction
Electrophoresis after purification
Electrophoresed TSUDA I 2 uL and 0.5 uL of purified solution
→Estimated concentration to be 54 ng/uL
This time band location is good
Accidentally excised a part of other band resulting small contamination
Gel purification of GFP( 1-12O ) and concentration check
Electrophoresis for concentration check
TSUDA I 2 uL, DNA 0.5 uL
→Estimated concentration to be 120 ng/uL
Part length is 878 + 220 bp = 947 bp
That slightly above mark so OK．
