Amplifiable BAC plasmid ( BBa_J61031 ) purification
Colony PCR of AraC+RBS+pSB1A3
Electroporetion of BAC plasmid into DH5α MG1655
Bac Vecter Purification
Used Qiagen miniprep kit, qiaprep for miniprep
Transfered 1.3 mL of BAC plasmid solution incubated overnight into 1.5 mL tube
Centrifuged at 4C, 15000 rpm for 1 min
Discarded the supernatant and added remaining solution.
Centrifuged at 4C, 15000 rpm for 1 min
Discarded the supernatant
Suspended on 250 uL of Buffer P1
Added 250 ul Buffer P2 inverted few times to mix, solution turned green
Added 350 ul Buffer N3 mixed by inversion, precipitation apeared
Centrifuged at 4C, 13000 rpm for 10 min
Transfered the supernatant to filtration column
Centrifuged at 4C, 13000 rpm for 1 min
Discarded the flow-through
added 500 uL of Buffer PB  to filtration column
Centrifuged at 4C, 13000 rpm for 1 min
Discarded the flow-through centrifuged for 1min to remove remaining buffer
Transfered filtration column to a new 1.5 ml tube
Resuspended on 50 ul of TE and incubated at RT for 1min
Centrifuged at 4C, 13000 rpm for 1 min
Stored at -20C
Colony PCR of AraC+RBS+pSB1A3
Selected 16 colonies at random, and PCRed them.
PCR mix used is shown in the table bellow
Reagent
Amount
Taq Master Mix
80 uL
Ex-F
1.6 uL
Ps-R
1.6 uL
Total
83.2 uL
Result of colony PCR
electrophoresed the samples
1 lane -> Marker λ/HindIII EcoRI 5 uL
2~8 lane -> colony No.1~7
9 lane -> Marker λ/HindIII EcoRI 5 uL
10~16 lane -> colony No.8~14
Colony No.15,16 didn't electrophorese.
Colony No.1 will have the plasmid,so we put the sample into 2 mL LB added 2 uL Ampicillin(100 ug/uL).Incubated it in a shaker at 37C, 180 rpm.
