glycerol-stock of E.coli with salmonella's BAC library vector
making of competent cell of E.coli with SPI2 BAC vector
plasmid & GFP-double terminator's Ligation & Transformation
PCR of E.coli with T3SSsignal and of GFP-double terminator
Ligation of plasmid and GFP-double terminator & Transformation
added 2 uL TE into plasmid solvant and GFP-double terminator solvant
mixed the samples
added 5 uL Mighty mix
incubated at 16C for 30min
added the sample to 100 uL competent cell
incubated at 0C for 30min
heatshocked at 42C for 60sec
incubated at 0C for 5min
added sample to 400 uL LB
incubated at 37C for 2 hours
plated the sample on LBA medium
incubated at 37C
PCR of Parts
We used special primers in this PCR which added EcoRI ,XbaI, RBS SpeI and PstI restriction sites to SlrP found BAC vector(B_STM02P01 SGSC401) to make a biobrick. So the finished part would be:
EcoRI+XbaI+RBS+SlrP+SpeI+PstI
Similarly,GFP+doubleterminator was amplified by primer which had a region of EcoRI and XbaI and of three NLSs. To make a part which would be:
EcoRI+XbaI+NLSx3GFP+doubleterminato+SpeI+PstI

electrophoresed the two samples, but a band of T3SS signal didn't show. Performed PCR and electrophoresis again,but a band of SlrP was weak. Cutted the band out and did gel extraction.
Stored at -20C.
