Results of yesterdays transformation
pSB1C3 uterly failed to produce colonies
pUC119 produced 20 colonies
colonies that should been red because of RFP insert wasn't, so there is possibility that insert wasn't there
Colony PCR on yesterdays E.coli
Colony PCR was done according to protocol
This day we did 20 samples
Electrophoresis
Concentration check of parts used for transformation yesterday
Electrophoresis of parts before ligation
Confirmed that DNA solution concentration of parts for Ligation was as anticipated (good?)

PCR of 1-3A
Transformation of 1-3A part which is originaly on pSB1C3 was succesful
Thinking that linearized vector might gone bad we PCRed pSB1C3 from 1-3A
