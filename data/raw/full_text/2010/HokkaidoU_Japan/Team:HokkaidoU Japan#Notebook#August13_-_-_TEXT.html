PCR of parts which didn't amplify well via mini prep
Composition of Reaction Solution
Reagent
Amount
Autoclaved DW :
33 uL
10x PCR buffer :
5 uL
2 mM dNTPs :
5 uL
25 mM MgSO4 :
3 uL
EX-F primer :
1 uL
PS-R primer :
1 uL
KOD plus Neo :
1 uL
Template ( 1-18F ) :
1 uL
Total :
50 uL
Removal of Primers
Added 150 uL of TE to 50 uL of PCR product, each
Transfered into Microcon YM-10 filter and cetrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 G
Much of the solution remained so centrifuged for aditional 10 min
Measured the amount left
It was 140 uL so centrifuged again for 10min
And again
Finally DNA solution was reduced to 19 uL so we added 31 uL to make final volume of 50 uL
Electrophoresis
PCR for DNA confirmation
Added 0.4 uL of 6x Sample Buffer to 1 uL of DNA solution and electrophoresed it.
At the same time add added 2 uL of 6x Sample Buffer to 10 uL of flow trough and centrifuged
Used marker pUC119/Hinf
It was confirmed that DNA was amplified by PCR
Between marker bands of 543 bp and 1330 bp PCR product band of 700 bp was visible
Due to negligence (electrophoresis for 45 min), flow through with primers flowed through and exited gel
