Digestion and ligation of pSB1C3, araC Promoter and GFP
Digestion
Electrophoresed digestion product
Used pSB1C3 which was PCRed september 6th. DNA concentration was 2256 ng/uL. So diluted 20 times.

→Incubated at 37C for 120 min
→Added Sample Buffer 10 uL and electrophoresed
pSB1C3 band wasn't visible
→ Other 2 were gel extracted
Diluted that final volume would be 40 uL
Ethanol precipitation
Electrophoresis after ethanol precipitation
Added ethanol acetate[3 M] 4 uL to 40 uL of previously purified DNA solution
Added EtOH[100%] 44 uL froze in dry ice
Melted and centrifuged at 15000 rpm, 4C 5 min
Discarded supernatant and added EtOH[70%] 100 uL rinsed
Centrifuged at 15,996rpm, 4C 5 min
Discarded supernatant and dried
Diluted in 2 uL of TE each
Anticipated concentrations
promoter: 125 ng/2uL
GFP: 106 ng/2uL
pSB1C3 was cut(EcoR1, Pst1) on September 6th
Did ethanol precipitation and electrophoresed to check concentration
It was about 20 ng/uL
→Used 2 uL of it

Total
12.4 uL
50 uL were transformed by electroporation and remaining 50 uL by heat shock (chemical)
