LB Culture
For every  2 mL of LB added 2 uL of antibiotics
Transfered a colony to LB
One colony didn't grow well so we isolated another one
Prepared more tubes for mini preps int he future
glycerol Stock
Added 1 mL of 80% Glycerol to screw cap tube
Added 1 mL of cell and broth solution to Glycerol after 2h of incubation
Sored at -80℃
Ligation
DNA Preparation for Ligation
Used 49 uL of yesterdays PCR product
Removed primers via Microcon YM-10
Added 450 uL of TE to make final volume of 500 uL
Centrifuged at 10000 G for more than an hour till all 4 samples volume was less then 45 uL
Measured the final amount of samples and added TE till all were 45 uL
Used 500 uL tubes
Ligation System
From PCR products we only used No.3 （ 1-23L （terminator）178 bp made on previous day
Tube No.

Electrophoresis
Performed electrophoresis for every digested sample, 1 through 4
Used marker pUC119/Hinf
DNA solution was too diluted and no bands were visible
