Total
20 uL
->Incubated at 37C for 60 min
Added 4 uL of 6x Sample Buffer making it total of 12 uL per lane and electrophoresed
->Extracted for gel
->Electrophoresed 10 uL of Extracted DNA
Used TSUDA Marker 1
Failure
After better inspection of Kit specs it came to lite that retreavel rate for 50 bp and less is 26%
RBS is just quite small when cut

Ethanol Precipication
Added 2 uL of sodium acetate(3 M)
Added 44 uL of Ethanol
Transfered to 1.5 mL tube and frozen with liquid nitrogen
Melted and centrifuged at 15000 rpm, 4C for 5 min
Transfered supernatant to another tube
Driven by precaution centrifuged the supernatant and discarded it's supernatant
Rinsed the tube walls with 100 uL of 70% Ethanol and centrifuged at 15000 rpm, 4C for 5 min
Discarded the supertenant and dried via vacuum desiccator
Melted in 5 uL of TE
Electrophoresis
Electrophoresis after Ethanol presipication
Added 1 uL of 6x SB to DNA Solution of 1 uL
Did the same to supernatant retreaved for precaution
