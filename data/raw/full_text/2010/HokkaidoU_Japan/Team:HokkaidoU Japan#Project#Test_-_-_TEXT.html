Type III Secretion System
What
   Type III Secretion Apparatus is a syringe-like organelle which can inject a whole protein molecule from a bacterial cell to a target eukaryotic cell. This apparatus is one of the members of Type III Secretion System (T3SS), which is essential for the pathogenicity of many pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella and Yersinia.
Why
   Currently, methods to introduce proteins directly into cells are complicated, although there are several entrenched transfection methods to introduce nucleic acid into cells. Moreover,  introduction of DNA changes cell genetic makeup permanently, but introduction of proteins chage the cell state temporary and afterwards the injected protein will be degraded leaving no permanent information in the target cell. In this regard, introduction of RNA ~
   In nature Type III Secretion Apparatus is used to secrete proteins that help the bacteria infect eukaryotic organisms however, this tecnology has huge potential. For example, the bacteria which can inject Yamanaka factors will be iPS cells generator E. coli.
