Fig.1
Colony PCR
Performed Colonie PCR for 3 colonies which were incubated over night (Fig.1)
Colony numbers were: 1, 2 and 3
Results showed no insertion
but when result came, had already done miniprep and prepared Sequencing Master Mix
Miniprep
Used Qiagen kit
Melted in 50 uL TE instead of H2O
Preparation for Sequencing
Mixed as shown in the table below
5x Sequencing Buffer     1.5uL    24.75 uL Ready Reaction Premix    1 uL     16.5 H2O                      5 uL     80 uL total 7.5/sample

Colony PCR (previous day's 3 piece ligation)
Did colony PCR of latecomers (No.5 to No.16)(Fig.3)
No.8, 10, 11, 12, 15 looked like good
Transfered No.8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16(control) to 2 mL LBT (Tetracycline 15 ug/mL) and started incubation

Fig.5
Colony PCR (T3SS signal)
Did colony PCR to amplify T3SS signal (from BAC clone that has T3SS signal insertion)
Colony solution 7 uL, quick Taq 10 uL, primer(Forward and Reverse) 1.5 uL each
Extention: 90 sec, 40 cycles
Electrophoresed to purify the DNA via gel extraction (Fig.4)
Electrophoresed to estimate the concentration of the DNA (Fig.5: λ/HindIII 2 uL, DNA solution 1 uL)
Concentration was estimated at 40 ng/uL
