Picked clones and screened for the positive ones.
Sent for sequencing.
Module I, Group 2c
To decrease the entropy of the reaction system, we decide to try a new ligation condition-1/10 system, which means all reacgents in the system is 10 percentage of normal quanlity and the total volume of reaction system is 10ul.
After purification, ligation reaction took place in a mixed system as following.
eGFP                 0.5ul mCherry              0.8ul Kan                  0.3ul T4 ligase(NEB)       0.5ul T4 ligation Buffer   1ul H2O                  6.4ul
Negative control
T4 ligase(NEB)       0.5ul T4 ligation Buffer   1ul H2O                  8ul
Incubate at 16°C. After 8h, add 0.5ul digested and dephophorylated PSB1Ca3 into reaction system. Continue to incubate at 16°C overnight.
