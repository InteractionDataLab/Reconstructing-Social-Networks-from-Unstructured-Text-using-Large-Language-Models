Module I, group 2(b)
Use the PEM② and PKC① to go on the further experiments. Double digestion.
Double digestion system:
PEM, PKC:
H2O          25.5μl  buffer tango  10μl  plasmid  10μl  EcoRI          1.5μl  BamHI          3μl  Total          50μl
Run a gel and cut to get the KC fragments and PEM plasmid. Ligate at 22℃ for 20min.
Ligation system:
H2O         11.8μl  10×buffer 2μl  KC         3μl  PEM         2.2μl  T4 ligase 1μl  Total         20μl
Transform the ligation product into bacterial cells immediately. Spread about 100μl of the resulting solutions on LB plates (with 0.1% ampicillin).
