Module I, Group 2c
To solve the problem of severe dimerization of primers, we tried to adjust PCR system and use different concentration of upstream and downstream primers.  As the concentration of PCR product is too low to be digested and purification, we attempted to use PCR product got yesterday as the template for PCR today.
PCR system (pyrobest):
H2O                        17.3ul  10×buffer                2.5μl  dNTP                        2.5μl  primer1                1μl  primer2                0.5μl  template                1μl  pyrobest                0.2μl  Total                        25μl
Result: to my disappoint, after gel purification,target fragments disappeared! What's worse, no PCR product of Chlr is seen in the gel photograph actually.
