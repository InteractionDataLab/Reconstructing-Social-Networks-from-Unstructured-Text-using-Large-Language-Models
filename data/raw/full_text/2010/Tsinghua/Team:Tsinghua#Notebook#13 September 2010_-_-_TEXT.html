Module I, group 2c
Since we have got no positive results for mutiple-fragment ligation, we really want to know the efficiency of it. Therefore, we use the ligation product as template, upstream primer of eGFP and downstream primer of Kan to run PCR, after which gel is run to check whether there is any ligation product of three fragments-eGFP, mCherry and Kan.
PCR system
ligation product       1ul up-primer              1ul down-primer            1ul H2O                    7ul Supermix               10ul
Result: ligation product of three fragments is little.
