Module I, Group 2c
To test the effectivity of newly-synthetized primer, PCR assay to amplify mCherry, Kan and eGFP, Chlr is conducted.
PCR system (FastPFU):
H2O                        31.5μl  5×buffer                10μl  dNTP                        5μl  primer1                1μl  primer2                1μl  template                1μl  FastPFU                0.5μl  Total                        50μl
PCR program----
1.95℃                        1min  2.95℃                 20s  3.53℃for eGFP               51℃for mCherry        20s    51℃for Kan&Chlr          4.72℃                        30s  30 cycles from 2 to 4  5.72℃                       5min
Result for PCR: After agarose gel is run, no specific bands are observed.
Conclusion: reaction condition for PCR is not ideal enough, thus we shall change the condition and try this again.
