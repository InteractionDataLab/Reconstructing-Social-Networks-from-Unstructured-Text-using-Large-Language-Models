Module I, group 2(b)
To ensure the result again, we decide to run a PCR with each gene’s own primers.
PCR system (SuperMix):
H2O         8.5μl  primer1 0.5μl  primer2 0.5μl  template 0.5μl  SuperMix 10μl  Total         20μl
And just before receiving the result, we also go on the experiments repeat the preview steps in case that we get the all negative result. One is to select another 12 colonies to amplify; another is to digest the eGFP, chlr and pUC19 again with the same system shown before.
In the afternoon, when the PCR has finished, run a 1.2% gel. The result is shown below.
Since the all 12 are all positive clones, stop the digestion and amplification step and go on the experiments. In consideration of the concentration of the plasmids and also the purity, we use P+E① and P+C③ undergo the follow steps.
Double digest of the mCherry, P+E①, kan and P+C③ for each pair of restriction sites. Digest at 37℃.
Double digestion system:
mCherry:
H2O         6μl  buffer BamHI 2μl  mCherry 9μl  SalI         2μl  BamHI         1μl  Total         20μl
P+E① for M:
H2O         11μl  buffer BamHI 2μl  P+E①          4μl  SalI         2μl  BamHI         1μl  Total         20μl
kan:
H2O         0μl  buffer BamHI 2μl  kan         15μl  KpnI         2μl  BamHI         1μl  Total         20μl
P+C③ for K:
H2O         11μl  buffer BamHI 2μl  P+C③          4μl  KpnI         2μl  BamHI         1μl  Total         20μl
Productions purify and measure the concentration. Ligate with Fermentas T4 ligase at 22℃ for 20min.
Ligation system:
P+E+M:
H2O         11.9μl  10×buffer 2μl  M         1.6μl  P+E for M 3.5μl  T4 ligase 1μl  Total         20μl
P+C+K:
H2O         14.4μl  10×buffer 2μl  K         1.7μl  P+C for K 0.9μl  T4 ligase 1μl  Total         20μl
Transform the ligation product into bacterial cells immediately. Spread about 100μl of the resulting solutions on LB plates (with 0.1% ampicillin).
