Module I, group 2(b)
Measure the concentration of the plasmids purified last night. Double digest to ensure the positive clone.
Double digestion system:
P+E:
H2O         6-8μl  buffer Tango 4μl  P+E         4-6μl  SalI         2μl  HindIII 2μl  Total         20μl
P+C:
H2O         6-11μl    buffer Tango 2μl    P+C         4-9μl    KpnI         3μl    Total         20μl   37℃ 1h, then   + buffer Tango     2.5μl  + EcoRI     1μl    Total     23.5μl
Run a gel after the digestion is finished.
result
We use the 0.8% agarose gel running first and it is quite un-clear around where 700bp band should be. So we run a 1.2% gel but it seemed that there is no positive result among the 12 clone.
