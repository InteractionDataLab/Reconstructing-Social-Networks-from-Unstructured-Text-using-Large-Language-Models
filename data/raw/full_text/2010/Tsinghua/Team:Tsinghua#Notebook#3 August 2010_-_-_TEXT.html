Module I, YX and ZY's part:
We digested former PCR products with DraIII for over 17 hours. After agarose electrophoresis, we extracted pure products from the gel and ligated with Takara Ligation Solution I.
Besides, colonies with T vector grew on the plates. We picked several colonies and cultured them in 3ml LB media in the shaker.
