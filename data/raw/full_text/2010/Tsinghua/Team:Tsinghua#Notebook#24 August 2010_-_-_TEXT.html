Liagtion for PEMK After purification, ligation reaction took place in a mixed system as following.
eGFP                 1ul mCherry              2ul Kan                  1ul T4 ligase(NEB)       1ul T4 ligation Buffer   2ul H2O                  13ul
Negative control
T4 ligase(NEB)       1ul T4 ligation Buffer   2ul H2O                  17ul
Incubate at 16°C. After 8h, add 2ul digested and dephophorylated PSB1Ca3 into reaction system. Continue to incubate at 16°C overnight.
