Module I, group 2(b)
Run a colony PCR with universal primers. Amplify the bacteria at the same time.
PCR system (SuperMix):
H2O         8μl  primer1 1μl  primer2 1μl  template Some  SuperMix 10μl  Total         20μl
result
The PEMKC 3-5 are positive. We’ll wait for the sequence result to ensure.
Module I, Group 2c
Pick several clones from the LB plate in the morning and amplify the plasmid by culturing the clone in LB.
Extract plasmid from the clone we Picked yesterday.  Digest the plasmid with EcoRI and run gel to identify whether the clone is a positive one.
digestion system
plasmid            6ul EcoRI              1ul FD Buffer          2ul H2O                11ul
Result: Two clones of PC are positive
