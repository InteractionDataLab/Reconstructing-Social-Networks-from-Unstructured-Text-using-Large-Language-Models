Module I, group 2c
As too many negative clones grown on the control plate, which means that vector has not been toally digested. To solve the problem, we decide to use gel purification to get purier digested plasmid.
Digest plasmid PSB1C13 with XbaI and SpeI, AP is used to dephosphorylate the 5' end of digestion result.
digestion system
PSB1C13        8ul FD Buffer      2ul XbaI           1ul SpeI           1ul H2O            8ul
Incubate at 37°C.
12h afterwards, run a gel and cut the band conaining digested vector and purify it with kit.
Result: Somehow the concentration of purified product is too low for the following experiment.
