Module I, group 2(b)
Use the K-up and K-do to detect the P+K+C. Meanwhile use the digestion protocol to ensure the result.
Double digestion system:
P+E+M:
H2O          5.5-10.5μl  buffer BamHI  2μl  P+E+M          5-10μl  SalI          1.5μl  BamHI          1μl  Total          20μl
P+K+C:
H2O          0-10.5μl  buffer BamHI  2μl  P+K+C          5-16μl  KpnI          1.5μl  BamHI          1μl  Total          20μl
Run a gel. Order: P+E+M 1-6 double digestion, Marker, P+K+C 1-6 double digestion, P+K+C PCR.
result
P+E+M② is positive. It seems that PKC 1-6 are positive. But it still remains unclear whether the PCR bands are so weak and why the digestion result seemed negative.
