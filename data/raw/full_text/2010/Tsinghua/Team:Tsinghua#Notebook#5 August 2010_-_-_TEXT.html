Module I, group 2(b)
pBMN-PIB plasmid purification.
result
No colony with pKD13 or pKD3 exists. It is said that these two plasmids also have the Amp resistant gene. We’ll try kan and chlr antibiotic to select next time.
Module I, YX and ZY's part:
Wonderful! Colonies grew on the plates! We tipped the colonies into 2ml LB media and cultured them on a 37 centigrade shaker. We'll extract plasmids from them later.
