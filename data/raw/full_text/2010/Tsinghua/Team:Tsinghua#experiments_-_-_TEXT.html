Our Experiments were carried out by the following nine groups which are somewhat independent from each other. Here come the Groups and Their Tasks.
Group 1A：Landing pad (LP) construction and Insertion with Tranditional Att Recomination method(Promoter Inside)
Group 1B：Landing pad (LP) construction and Insertion with Innovational Att Recomination method(Promoter Outside)
Group 1C：Landing pad (LP) construction and Insertion: Inducement and Recombination
Group 2A：Donor Plasmid Construction: Two Fragments Construction (Three Fragments Ligation)
Group 2B：Donor Plasmid Construction: Traditional Four Fragments Construction
Group 2C：Donor Plasmid Construction: Four Fragments Construction with Dra III
Group 2D：Donor Plasmid Construction: Four Fragments Construction with Novel Methods
Group 3：Helper Plasmid (HP) Insertion, Donor Plasmid Insertion, Recombination Induction & Removal of HP
Group 4：Screening Strategy
Protocols
Here are our Experimental Protocols in PDF version.
