Overlap pcr to ligate p and t together. NO positive results.

HAHA~ We find a new approach to achieve our aim!
First we amplify gene fragments Pt and V from the origin plasmid through PCR. That is to say, we change the promoter's location.
The primers used for Pt are ITF and ITR, and primers pUKF and pUKR are for fragment V.
Then The PCR product is purified by gel extraction kit. Unfortunately, after gel extraction, we lose our sample.  Maybe there is something wrong with our experimental operation or the reagents of the kit.  We have to do it again.  %>_<%
