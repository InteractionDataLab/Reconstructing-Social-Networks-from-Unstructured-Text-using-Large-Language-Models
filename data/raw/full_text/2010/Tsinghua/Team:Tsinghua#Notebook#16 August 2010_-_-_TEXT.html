Module I, group 2(b)
Universal primers of pUC19 are available now (marked p-up and p-do)! Use the universal primers to detect PEM, PKC and PEMKC with SuperMix system shown before.
result
The result shows that PEM plasmids are truly positive but kan gene were not ligated successfully. So that the EMKC are not positive with K missed.
Module I, group 2c
Run the same PCR program as yesterday and purify the product with gel purification kit.

12h after digestion, the products are purified with kit.
