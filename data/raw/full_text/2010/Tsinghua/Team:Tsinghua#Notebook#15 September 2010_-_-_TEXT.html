Module I, group 2c
Since it seems as if no ligation product of three fragments appeared in the PCR identification result, we strongly doubt that there is something wrong with the DraIII cutting site, perhaps there lies mutaion site. To confirm our proposal, we decide to conduct the ligation sepratatively and then PCR is run.
Ligation for EM
eGFP                 1ul mCherry              2ul T4 ligase(NEB)       1ul T4 ligation Buffer   2ul H2O                  14ul
Ligation for MK
Kan                  1ul mCherry              2ul T4 ligase(NEB)       1ul T4 ligation Buffer   2ul H2O                  14ul
