Team:Tsinghua/Notebook/30 July 2010
From 2010.igem.org
Module I, Group 2c
To get target fragments with higher concentration, PCR and gel purification is conducted.  PCR system and program is the same as what I used yesterday.
Result: to my disappoint, after gel purification,target fragments disappeared! The concentration of fragments is less than 10ng/ul, which is far from enough for following digestion and ligation. Besides, dimerization of primers is severe.
