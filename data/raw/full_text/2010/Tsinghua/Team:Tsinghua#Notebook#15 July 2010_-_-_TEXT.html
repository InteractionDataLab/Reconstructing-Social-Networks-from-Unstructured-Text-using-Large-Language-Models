Module I, group 2(b)
Ligate E (short for eGFP, the same below) and M (short for mCherry), K (short for Kan) and C (short for Chlr) first at 25℃ for 0.5h.
Ligation system:
EM:
H2O         6.98μl  10×buffer 1μl  eGFP         0.65μl  mCherry 0.87μl  T4 ligase 0.5μl  Total         10μl
KC:
H2O         7.15μl  10×buffer 1μl  Kan         0.57μl  Chlr         0.78μl  T4 ligase 0.5μl  Total         10μl
Take 5μl from ligation system to run a gel, other 3μl run a 25μl PCR with each longer fragments’ up-stream and down-stream primers.
PCR system (FastPFU):
H2O         13μl  5×buffer 5μl  dNTP         2.5μl  primer1 0.5μl  primer2 0.5μl  template 3μl  FastPFU 0.5μl  Total         25μl
result
Ligation systems have no result directly running a gel and the PCR products also give a strange outcoming…
