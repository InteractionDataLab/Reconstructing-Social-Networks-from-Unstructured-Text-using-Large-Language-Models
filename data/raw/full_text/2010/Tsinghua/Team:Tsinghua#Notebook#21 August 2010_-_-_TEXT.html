Module I, group 2c
Extract plasmid from the clone we Picked yesterday.  Digest the plasmid with EcoRI and run gel to identify whether the clone is a positive one.
digestion system
plasmid            6ul EcoRI              1ul FD Buffer          2ul H2O                11ul
Result: None of the clone picked is positive.
Analysis: Since no positive clones have been found, we come to check the principle and design of our experiment.  We realize that if we use AP to treat with inserted fragments and vector, it is obvious that ligation can not talk place.
