Module I, group 2(b)
Double digestion of the eGFP, chlr and pUC19 for each pair of restriction sites. Digest at 37℃.
Double digestion system:
eGFP:
H2O         2μl  buffer Tango 4μl  eGFP         10μl  SalI         2μl  HindIII 2μl  Total         20μl
pUC19 for E:
H2O         10μl  buffer Tango 4μl  pUC19         2μl  SalI         2μl  HindIII 2μl  Total         20μl
chlr:
H2O         5μl    buffer Tango 2μl    chlr         10μl    KpnI         3μl    Total         20μl   37℃ 1h, then   + buffer Tango    2.5μl  + EcoRI    1μl  Total            23.5μl
pUC19 for C:
H2O         13μl    buffer Tango 2μl    pUC19         2μl    KpnI         3μl    Total         20μl    37℃ 1h, then   + buffer Tango    2.5μl  + EcoRI    1μl  Total            23.5μl
Productions purify and measure the concentration. Ligate with NEB T4 ligase at 25℃ for 1h.
Ligation system:
H2O         1.2μl  10×buffer 1μl  fragment 2.3μl  plasmid 5μl  T4 ligase 0.5μl  Total         10μl
Transform the ligation product into bacterial cells immediately. Spread about 200μl of the resulting solutions on LB plates (with 0.1% ampicillin).
Module I, group 2c
Considering some special requirements and limitation of available resources, we changed primers and plasmid for the constructs. Morever, we come to use SuperMix from Transgen as our PCR npolymerase.
PCR system (supermix):
Supermix         25ul H2O              21ul template         2ul primer(up)       1ul primer(down)     1ul Total            50ul
PCR program
1.94°C          5min 2.94°C           30s 3.50-60°C(Grad)  30s 4.72°C           1min cycle X 30, from 2 to 4
Result: the result is really exciting! Specific target genes are successfully modified and purified for further experiment.
