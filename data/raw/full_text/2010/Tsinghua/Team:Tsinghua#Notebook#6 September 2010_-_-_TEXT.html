From 2010.igem.org
YX's part
Inoculated Chloramphenicol-LB with bacteria harboring Chloramphenicol resistance gene containing T-vectors. Inoculated the same media with bacteria harboring T-vectors with scrambled insertion sequence. Shook the media in a 37 centigrade shaker.
Checked the results after 13 hours. Both media became turbid. The one with scrambled sequence became darker in color, indicating possible contamination. Decided to repeat the experiments later.
