Module I, group 2(b)
Detect the concentration of the four digestion products.  (Only the Chlr enjoys an acceptable concentration, we cannot go on our ligation today.)
Repeat the PCR.  (We found that the 30 cycles’ PCR products could not meet our need of the concentration of eGFP and mCherry. We’ll try 35 cycles next time.)
