Module One 1:
PCR for Tet, Landing Pad added. Pyrobest Enzyme
Module I, Group 2c
We are informed that the volume of PCR system somehow has an effect on the result. Usually, 25ul or 20ul is a better option than 50ul system. To further modify the condition for PCR, we compared the result of 25ul and 50ul system.
PCR system (pfu):
H2O                        13ul  5×buffer                5ul  dNTP                        2.5μl  primer1                1μl  primer2                0.5μl  template                1μl  FastPFU                2μl  Total                        25μl
PCR system (pfu):
H2O                        26ul  5×buffer                10ul  dNTP                        5μl  primer1                2μl  primer2                1μl  template                2μl  FastPFU 4μl  Total                        50μl
Result: No specific target bands are seen in the gel photograph.
