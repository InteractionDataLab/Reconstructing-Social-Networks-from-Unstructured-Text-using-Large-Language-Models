From 2010.igem.org
Module I, group 2(b)
Digest the four fragments with restriction enzyme separately except the SalI and EcoRI at 37℃ for more than 3h. Ligate the four fragments at 25℃ for an hour.
Ligation system:
H2O         22.5μl  10×buffer 5μl  fragments 5μl each  T4 ligase 2.5μl  Total         50μl
Run a gel.
Result
There isn’t any ligation product exists… Even though it exists, the concentration is not high enough to be detected. We’ll improve the ligation protocol!
