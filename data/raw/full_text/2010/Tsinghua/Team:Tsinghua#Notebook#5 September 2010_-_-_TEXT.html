From 2010.igem.org
YX's part
Checked all the sequencing results before. The sequence was correct. But I noticed a single base insert at the end of the sequence, which should be part of the primer. I strongly doubted its a sequencing error, but all the sequencing results were the same. To continue or not to continue, that was a problem.
Then the effect of the resistance gene must be checked.
