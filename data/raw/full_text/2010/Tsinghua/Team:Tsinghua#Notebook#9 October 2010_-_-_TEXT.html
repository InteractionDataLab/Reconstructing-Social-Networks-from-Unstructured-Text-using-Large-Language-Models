Module I, Group 1A
Colony pcr to screen the clones in which landing pad has successfully integrated into genome, using up primers from the plasmid and down primers from the genome. Select the positive clones to amplify in LB media with 0.03% tetracyclin.
Module I, Group 2c
After purification, ligation reaction took place in a mixed system as following， respectively.
eGFP                 3ul PSB1C13              2ul T4 ligase(NEB)       1ul T4 ligation Buffer   2ul H2O                  12ul
mCherry              2ul PSB1C13              2ul T4 ligase(NEB)       1ul T4 ligation Buffer   2ul H2O                  13ul
Kan                  3ul PSB1C13              2ul T4 ligase(NEB)       1ul T4 ligation Buffer   2ul H2O                  12ul
