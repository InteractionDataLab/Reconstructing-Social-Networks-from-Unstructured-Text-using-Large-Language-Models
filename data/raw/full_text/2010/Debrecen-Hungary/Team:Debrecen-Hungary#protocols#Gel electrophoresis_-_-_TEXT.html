Scientific Background
Gel electrophoresis is a technique used for the separation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), or protein molecules using an electric field applied to a gel matrix. DNA Gel electrophoresis is usually performed for analytical purposes, often after amplification of DNA via PCR The results can be analyzed quantitatively by visualizing the gel with UV light and a gel imaging device. The image is recorded with a computer operated camera, and the intensity of the band or spot of interest is measured and compared against standard or markers loaded on the same gel. The measurement and analysis are mostly done with specialized software.
Overview
Materials
agarose
sterilized bottle
1x TAE
microwave
G-red
ladder
pippett(0.5-10µl)
Gel electrophoresis apparatus
Procedure
1.  masure 1 g agarose (for 1% gel agarose).
2.  put it into a sterilized bottle.
3.  masure 100 ml 1x TAE.
4.  put the bottle into the microwave (must not close the bottle totally), heat it still it will be fully clear.
5.  Take the bottle out from the microwave with the plastic gripping.
6.  Cold down the bottle in water bath until you can touch it.
7.  Add 100 µl G-red into the bottle (because 1000x must attenuate).
8.  Shake gently the bottle still the red color disappears.
9. Put the liquid from the bottle into the gel tray (if there are any bubbles in ti you can punch them with a tip)
10. After it became solid turn the gel rack to 90°.
11. Put 1% TAE into the gel tray still the level of line on the wall
12. Take out the comb andclean it
13. Put a ladder (3-6 µl) into the first hole
14. Into a new tube mix the loading dye(1 µl) and your sample(5 µl)
