Building a iGEM SynBio team and performing the experiments of the project needs substantial support. Beside having the infrastructure provided by the University of Debrecen Medical and Health Science Centre, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, our work was supported by outstanding external sponsors. The University and the Department supported our work in several ways and details will be giveen below. Our external sponsors supported us with reagents, individual subproject sponsorship and other ways.  

<H2>Platinum Level</H2><DIV class="gallery" id="sponsor1"><A href="http://osli.ca/"><H3>Oil Sands Leadership Initiative </H3></A><P> The Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI) is a collaborative network between ConocoPhillips Canada, Nexen Inc., Statoil Canada, Suncor Energy Inc. and Total E&amp;P Canada.
OSLI's vision is to achieve world-class environmental, social and economic performance in developing this world-scale oil sands resource. Our mission is to lead the oil sands industry in the responsible development of Alberta's bitumen resource by taking action to improve the environmental, social and economic performance of Alberta's oil sands. 
Oils sands initiative is encouraging the development of new ideas and is one of the sponsors of iGEM. You can read more about these new ideas <A href="http://www.osli.ca/newideas" class="external text" rel="nofollow">here</A> 
Our team received substantial funding from Oil sands Initiative, this funds were mainly used for travel to the Jamboree of the team. We also received samples for testing in our newly developped SynBio test system.</P><H2>Gold Level</H2><DIV class="gallery" id="sponsor2"><A href="http://www.roche.com/index.htm"><H3>Roche</H3></A><P> Roche is focusing on developing medicines and diagnostics that will help patients live longer, better lives.
Roche strives to address unmet medical needs through excellence in science – from early detection and prevention of diseases to diagnosis, treatment and treatment monitoring.  Finding innovative solutions for serious medical problems is what being a healthcare company is about. Roche’s research and development efforts aim to enable healthcare to be tailored more closely to patients’ needs.
As both a diagnostics and a pharmaceuticals company, Roche is ideally placed to contribute to progress towards more personalised healthcare, opening up new ways to prevent, diagnose and treat illness.
Our team was supported by Roche Hungry to develop the video protocol project in order to help further generations of students to enter in the field of life science research.

http://www.ud-mhsc.org/"><H3>University of Debrecen, Medical and Heath Science Centre- International Education Center</H3></A><P> The University of Debrecen, Medical and Heath Science Centre aims to inspire both students and teachers - according to the possibilities of the free creative spirit due to the university rank - to acquire a high level of professionalism, exactness and problem solving skills, upon which the foundations of specialist training and an independent medical practice can be built, which enables them to absorb the prospective scientific development of the next decades, which facilitates further education and development of their knowledge throughout their life. 
Beside various administrative help the travel to the Jamboree of the team members who study in the english language Medical training Programme, was fully financed by the International Education Center of the University. </P><DIV class="gallery" id="sponsor4"><A href="http://rcmm.med.unideb.hu"><H3>University of Debrecen, Medical and Heath Science Centre- Research Center for Molecular Medicine </H3></A><P> RCMM (Research Centre for Molecular Medicine) is a research institute of the Medical and Health Science Center of the University of Debrecen, dedicated to clinically oriented and basic  cutting edge biomedical research. RCMM operates as a network of collaborating research laboratories aiming at  advancing molecular life sciences and our understanding of human diseases. These activities have been supported by interactions with the the Medical and Health Science Center of the University of Debrecen, one of the largest  Academic Medical Centers in the country.  RCMM was also created in order to facilitate joint research projects and mutual use of core facilities.
During our work beside the infrastructure of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology we used also the laboratory space of the Clinical Genomics Center, one of the Core Facilities of the RCMM.

Phagocytosis is a highly complex and redundant process that is influenced by the treatment of phagocytes and the cell types engulfed that may have different origin. The lab focuses on the phagocytosis of cells dying by different types of programmed cell deaths such as apoptosis, autophagy or necroptosis.

</H3><P>The Hungarian higher education law declares that every university must have its students’ union. The students’ union is the only legal representative organization that represent students on every Hungarian university.
At University of Debrecen the structure of the Students’ Union is the following. University Students’ Union is responsible for all the 30000 students around University of Debrecen. The president is a member of the Rector’s Council, the highest decision maker board of the university. Every University Centre, namely: Centre for Agricultural and Applied Economic Sciences, Centre of Arts, Humanities and Sciences and Medical and Health Science Centre, has its vice president, and each faculty of the University of Debrecen has its own Students’ Union. Additionally, the University Students’ Union has several committees (eg. Students’ Committee for International Affairs, Students’ Committee for Healthcare and Sports, Students’ Committee for Environment Protection).
The Medical and Health Science Centre faculties – namely Faculty of General Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry, Faculty of Health, Faculty of Pharmacy, Faculty of Public Health – Students’ Union work closely together, have common committees and projects. In general, students’ union works on all affairs that connected with students’ life. The Students’ Union supports all the students’ proposals that benefit the student community. The iGEM project is one of these.
