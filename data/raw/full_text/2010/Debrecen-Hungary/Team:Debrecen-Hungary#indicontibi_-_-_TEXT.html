Team Instructors(in alphabetical order)
Balint L. Balint - Initiated the project, made the team recruitment, fund raising, some of the PR, laboratory setup, helped shaping the project, seting up of the team.  I supervised the first lab experiments and planned some of the experiments later on, ordered parts and reagents, organized finances, organized administrative issues of the trip. Supervised wiki and partsregistry work.
Peter Brazda - Supervised planing and evaluation of luciferase assays. Participated in wet-lab education and the wiki-works. Co-mentored students in discussing scientific problems and questions of NR-biology.
Mate Demeny -  Implementation of the general approach for the design of the BBF_ RFC 25 compatible parts. Supervised the cloning process and designed adaptors to the pCDNA3.1. Tutoring the cloning process. Troubleshooting for the cloning team.
Gabor Zahuczky - Supported the initiation of the project, fund raising, organization of finances and administration. Participated in the design of parts and wet lab education.
