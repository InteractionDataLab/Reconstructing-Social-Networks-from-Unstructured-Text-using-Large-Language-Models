Favorite parts of Team: Debrecen-Hungary
13 composite parts have been created, including two expression vectors produced from standard BioBrick parts. In this section we collected the three favorite parts which showed high expression level and functional activity in the transfected cells.
TRE-Gal4-PXR-PolyA in PSB1A3 (expression vector)
Expression vector from standard BioBrick parts, expressing Gal4 - human Pregnane X receptor LBD composite part.
The Gal4-PXR Chimeric nuclear receptor is an artificial eukaryotic TF made of Gal4 DBD (DNA Binding Domain) and H. sapiens nuclear hormone receptor LBD (Ligand Binding Domain) which can be expressed by this expression vector.
The minimal CMV promoter ensures a continuous expression of the chimeric construct, but furthermore it can be expressed in an inducible form using the Tetracyclin-controlled transcriptional activation system. Go to the official parts registry page for this part
PXR LBD
PXR is a xenobiotic-activated member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors. PXR is involved in transcriptional induction of hepatic xenobiotic-catabolizing cytochrome 3A enzymes, playing a fundamental role in protecting body tissues from toxic bile acids. PXR is almost exlcusively expressed in the gastrointestinal system (stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and gall bladder) and liver, with lower levels in the kidney and ovary. PXR dysfunction is associated with immune disorders (sclerosing cholangitis, inflammatory bowel disease) and biliary primary cirrhosis.
Gal4 DBD
This protein is a positive regulator for the gene expression of the galactose-induced genes such as GAL1, GAL2, GAL7, GAL10, and MEL1 which encode for the enzymes used to convert galactose to glucose. This protein contains a fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear cluster domain.
TRE-CMV
The Tetracycline Response Element (TRE) is recognized and bound by the Tetracycline repressor (TetR) protein. The TRE consists of 7 repeats separated by spacer sequences and placed upstream of CMV minimal promoter that has basal expession in the abscence of bound TetR. Tetracycline derivatives (e.g. doxycycline) bind TetR and render it incapable of binding to TRE, thereby forcing the expression of target genes.
PolyA
The PolyA tail of mRNA has multiple adenilates which is important for the nuclear export, translation and stability of mRNA in eukaryotes.
This composite artificial transcription factor will activate any reporter or any gene in general that has a UAS (Upper Activating Sequence) 3' of it's promoter. The usual binding sites of reporters, contain multiple UAS elements. In order to have a POPS output, the LBD has to recruit activators in the cell. This can be initiated by ligand binding or by recruiting a protein that has a fused strong activator like the VP activator.
With this system NHR (Nuclear Hormone Receptor) ligands or NHR interacting partners can be screened.
The NHR: cofactor-VP interaction should be also broken by a potential ligand binding, this is why this setup is also suitable for ligand identification. The benefit of the cofactor-VP interaction test is that the dynamic range of the assay is much higher than the dynamic range of the normal Gal4-NHR ligand activation assay.

Gal4 DBD - Ecdysone receptor LBD
Artificial eukaryotic TF made of Gal4 DBD (DNA Binding Domain) and D. Melanogaster nuclear hormone receptor LBD (Ligand Binding Domain). Go to the official parts registry page for this part
EcR LBD
The ecdysone receptor is a nuclear receptor found in arthropods, where it controls development and contributes to other processes such as reproduction. The receptor is a non-covalent heterodimer of two proteins, the EcR protein and ultraspiracle protein (USP). It binds to and is activated by ecdysteroids. Pulses of 20-hydroxyecdysone occur during insect development, whereupon this hormone binds to the ecdysone receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor found in the nuclei of insect cells. This in turn leads to the activation of many other genes, which ultimately causes physiological changes that result in ecdysis (moulting).
Gal4 DBD
This protein is a positive regulator for the gene expression of the galactose-induced genes such as GAL1, GAL2, GAL7, GAL10, and MEL1 which encode for the enzymes used to convert galactose to glucose. This protein contains a fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear cluster domain.

Ecdysteroids
Ecdysteroids  are  insect  moulting  and  sex  hormones  which  include  ecdysone  and  its  homologues  such  as  20-hydroxyecdysone.  Ecdysteroids  also  occur  in  other  invertebrates where they can play a different role. They also appear in many plants  mostly  as  a  protection  agents  (toxins  or  antifeedants)  against  herbivore  insects.  These  phytoecdysteroids  have  medicinal  value  and  are  part  of  herbal  adaptogenic  remedies like cordyceps.
Physiological functions of EcR
Pulses of 20-hydroxyecdysone occur during insect development, whereupon this hormone binds to the ecdysone receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor found in the nuclei of insect cells. This in turn leads to the activation of many other genes, as evidenced by chromosomal puffing at over a hundred sites. Ultimately the activation cascade causes physiological changes that result in ecdysis (moulting).
Potential applications of GAL4-EcR LBD
By the addition of lipid ligands(ecdysteroids), the created system activates the expression of any kind of genes fused to UAS (upstream activation seqence)previously. Also can be used as a lipid sensor by activating reporter genes (e.g. Luciferase).

ER LBD
ER-α is a 17β-estradiol-activated steroid receptor member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors. It has a variety of central physiological roles, including those involved in maintenance of the reproductive, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and central nervous systems. ER-α is expressed at low to moderate levels in major physiological systems (central nervous system (CNS), endocrine, metabolic, gastrointestinal, immune, reproductive, cardiovascular, respiratory and structural), with peaks of expression in the pituitary, ovary, uterus and vas deferens. ER-α dysfunction is associated with cancer, cardiovascular system defects, hematological system defects, immune and inflammation diseases, metabolic defects, reproductive defects.

Estrogens
Estrogens (AmE), oestrogens (BE), or œstrogens, are a group of steroid compounds,  named  for  their  importance  in  the  estrous  cycle,  and  functioning  as  the  primary  female  sex  hormone.  Their  name  comes  from  estrus/oistros  (period  of  fertility  for  female mammals) + gen/gonos = to generate.
Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates as well as some insects. The presence  of  these  steroids  in  both  vertebrate  and  insects  suggests  that  estrogenic  sex  hormones have an ancient history.
Estrogens  are  used  as  part  of  some  oral  contraceptives,  in  estrogen  replacement  therapy  for  postmenopausal  women,  and  in  hormone  replacement  therapy  for  trans  women.
Like inside  the  cell,  they  bind  to  and  activate  estrogen  receptors  which  in  turn  modulate the G protein-coupled receptor, GPR30.
Physiological function of ER
In the absence of hormone, estrogen receptors are largely located in the cytosol. Hormone binding to the receptor triggers a number of events starting with migration of the receptor from the cytosol into the nucleus, dimerization of the receptor, and subsequent binding of the receptor dimer to specific sequences of DNA. Some of the effects in humans: Createing proliferative endometrium,breast cell stimulation, increased body fat and weight gain, salt and fluid retention, increased risk of blood clots.
Possible applications of GAL4-ER
By the addition of lipid ligand, the created system activates the expression of any kind of genes fused to UAS(upstream activation seqence)previously. Also can be used as a lipid sensor by activating reporter genes (e.g. Luciferase).
