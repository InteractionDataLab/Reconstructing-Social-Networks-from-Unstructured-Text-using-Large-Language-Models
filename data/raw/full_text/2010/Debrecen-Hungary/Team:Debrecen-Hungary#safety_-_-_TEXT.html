Biosafety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issue in terms of research safety, public saftety, or environmental safety?
No issue of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety were raised during Debrecen's iGEM 2010 project.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
We only worked with non-hazardous, non-infectious, commonly used and accepted bacteria strain (DH5α) and mammalian cancer cell lines (COS-1). When working with toxic chemicals (e.g. ethidiumbromide or estrogen), nitrile gloves, and white coats were worn. All of the work was conducted in a biosafety level S1 laboratory. Rules of the best microbiological practices were applied. All material handled or distributed are non-hazardous and non-infectious. It agrees with all safety standards requested biosafety level 1, therfore the project get a full supports for the work done by the iGEM team.  We developed synthetic LBD's for use in mammalian cells in fusion parts. These parts are completely harmless, no matter what organism they are transformed / transfected into.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Our project leader and team instructors oversaw the biological safety issue throughout the whole working time this year. There is also a biosafety supervisor who supervises the overall laboratory work biosecurity-wise.
