SynBioWave 2.0 – Developers Guide
While SynBioWave wants to be a great tool for biologists it is already a great project for it's developers. In this section of the page we let you look behind the curtain and show you how SynBioWave was made and is continuously improved.
Developer Guide
This Developer guide will teach you step-by-step how to create your own add-on robots for SynBioWave. A little knowledge of Java is required to follow the guide.
Used Technologies
SynBioWave makes use of some Technologies that are already out there. Find out what they are and how we use them in this part of the page.
Architecture
SynBioWave uses a lot of different techniques and combines them to a whole system. In this part of the page, we want to give you an insight on the internal structure of SynBioWave 2.0
Availability
SynBioWave is completely open source. On this page we show you how you can get the sourcecode of SynBioWave and maybe take part in it's future development.
