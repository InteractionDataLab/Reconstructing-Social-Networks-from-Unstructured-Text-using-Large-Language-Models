SynBioWave 2.0 – User Guide
SynBioWace 2.0 is aimed at people who work in the field of Synthetic Biology. It offers a variety of tasks and is easy to use. In this guide we will show you step-by-step how to get access to it and how to use it.
You will learn how to get a wave account and how to turn a simple wave into a SynBioWave to collaborate with colleagues all over the globe in real time. You can dive right into it: There are almost no prerequisites to start working with SynBioWave. All you need is a web browser capable of displaying the wave properly, such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Safari (for more information please see this link )
Another important feature of SynBioWave is the opportunity to write custom add-on robots that are easily integrated with the existing program. If you would like to know how this is done please see: Developer Guide
User Guide
In this part of the User Guide you will learn how to set
up the SynBioWave Environment and use the basic functions, such as importing BioBricks, documentation and exporting your data. You will need this knowledge to advance to the second part.
Robots
We have created a series of Add-on robots that can perform several task related to Synthetic Biology. In this second part of the User Guide we will present them to
