SynBioWave 2.0 – Project Overview
SynBioWave is an open-source, Synthetic Biology software suite. SynBioWave enables research collaboration by real-time sharing of parts, design and documentation. Moreover, biologists can record and share the process of creating research data.
SynBioWave is not just another program or software tool but an Open-source, highly extensible software suit. People with minimal programming knowledge can extend it to their synthetic biological needs by writing custom add-on robots that are easily integrated with the existing program. If you would like to know how this is done please see: Developer Guide . You can also have a look at the code here
