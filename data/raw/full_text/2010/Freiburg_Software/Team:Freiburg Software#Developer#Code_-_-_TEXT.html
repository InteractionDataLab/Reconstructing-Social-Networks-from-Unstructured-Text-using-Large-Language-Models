In this section of the page we want to give you an insight into the internals of SynBioWave: the program code.
Synbiowave is written in Java using the Google Wave API and Biojava. Google provides an AbstractRobot class that developers can use to build their own Robots.
We created an AbstractSynBioWaveRobot that extends this robots.
AbstractSynBioWaveRobot
The AbstractSynBioWaveRobot class is one of the central classes in SynBioWave, because every robot is an implementation of this one. It handles all actions every robot has to do like menu extension and workspace access.
