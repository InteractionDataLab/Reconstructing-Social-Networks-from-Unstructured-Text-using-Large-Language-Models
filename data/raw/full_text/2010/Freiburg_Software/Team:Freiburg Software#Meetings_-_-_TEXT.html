September
Sep. 24 2010
Niklas, Paul, Paresh, Kristian, Fabian
Do we need all of the three Requirements for a gold medal or just one of these? -> E-Mail to the HQ
Collaboration -> The things we have done are not enough. We could implement a converter for Geneious <->BioBrick™ formate. An other idea was to write a program that helps the Labteam to design primer.
Niklas showed us his Blast-Search-Robot. It works good. One question was the menu button position.
Paresh made a translation-Robot. The six-reading-frame still a problem.
But now they can upload to sourceforge.
For the Human practise we could write a Safety-Test-Robot witch looks for virus information in the sequence.
For donation: Niklas have a contact person at SAP. We will write a letter, maybe we get some money.
More function in the wave:
BioBrick import and export with the option to choose/search a Part by No.
The same for other Databases e.g. Genbank
seaching for restriction-sites

Niklas, Paresh, Fabian
Spoke about the conversation Fabian and Paul had with Kristian
Fabian showed some new ideas for robots and explained the biology behind them.
Primer design
Colored DNA tripplet
Database download
Virus check
Paresh had the idea for a Umbrella-robot. It lists all the available robots and lets them add in the wave. We meet Fr. 1.oct. 7pm at bio II/III
Sep. 30 2010
Niklas, Paresh, Fabian, Volker (LabTeam)
Volker explained us the rules for primers design.
The Translation Robot and the Blast Robot are fixed. There are a new local alignment Robot (Niklas)
Kristian is not here tomorrow so we will write him an e-mail to show him the new Robots.
October
Oct. 5 2010
Kristian, Fabian
Fabian showed Kristian the new robots and discussed the functionality and the usability.
Translation Robot (translation-beta@appspot.com)
The view should be something like 1. original DNA-Strand 2. first Frame (with all proteins) a.s.o. and all among each other.
ATGGAATTCTCGCTCTAGCTACGTAGCTATGGAATTCTCGCTCTAG
-M--E--F--S--L--*------------M--E--F--S--L--*- (look for the right positions in the edit window)
In the input matrix there should be an option to choose the start/stop codons and something to choose the organism.
Primer Design Robot (synbiowave-primerdesigner@appspot.com)
An option to choose the add-on-tail (iGEM standard, own sequence, none)
Maybe we could implement two different versions to calculate the temperature.
Restriction Enzymes Robot (REBase)
Imput:
Enzymes from the workspace (could be more than 50 to select like the sequences). or something to type it like this: EcoRI, XbaI, ... . One selection for iGEM.
min and max cut (the length the enzymes will cut)
output
EcoRI: Start: 10, 55, 126, ... XbaI: Start: 26, 71, 99, ... view like this: EcoRI |     XbaI |
GCATGCGCTAGCTGCTGAGCATGAATTCACTGTTCTAGAATCGTACT (look for the right positions in the edit window)
Alignment Robot (alignobot@appspot.com)
Show the algorithm which is used (niedelman/wunsch...smith waterman...).
Blast Robot
restart the BlastRobot Project
Is it possible to scroll the menu with the wave?
3rd wave for graphics like the workspace.
Oct. 7 2010
Fabian, Kristian, Niklas
We discussed some (new) Ideas we could implement:
Ligate Bioprick parts
Import of GenBank etc is important
Display features (annotations)
Is it possible to work with selected Sequences in the main Wave?
Keep 5' -> 3' direction!
Okt. 11 2010
Niklas, Fabian, Paresh
Annotation robot: how to display the output. We will try using the GadgetView Gadget and adjust it to display annotations.
Translation Robot output now looks good. A problem is, that Biojava translate seems to take long. Maybe write own translation method?
Talked about the organism identifier robot. Checked codon usage database.
Oct. 12 2010
Jörg, Paresh, Fabian, Niklas
Paresh presented the latest version of Translation Robot which works well. we will move the coloring form the robots to the gadget to gain performance
Niklas presented the PartsRegistry import function which got included in the main robot.
We created a new synbiowave-V2-001.jar as the new developer library.
Next meeting: Oct. 14 @Lab(Kitchen)
Oct. 15 2010
Paresh, Fabian, Niklas
We created a "roadmap" of all the tasks that we still have to do and assigned each of them to one of us

Deadline: Oct. 24 (meeting TBA)
Oct. 21 2010
Fabian, Paresh, Jörg, Niklas
We discussed some details of the wiki (pictures, ect.)
Worked together on the new circular view
Tried the new Wave-in-a-box -> The client is still in beta stage and its not sure if robots will work, so no alternative for the jamboree.
Oct. 22- 24 2010
Fabian, Paresh, Niklas
Wrote the wiki together
Oct. 25 2010
Fabian, Jörg, Niklas
We created the new wave window for graphics
