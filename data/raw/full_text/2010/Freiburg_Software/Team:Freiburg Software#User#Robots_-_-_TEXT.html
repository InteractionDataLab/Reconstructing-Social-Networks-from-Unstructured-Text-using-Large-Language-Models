Add-on Robots
Many features SynBioWave offers are realized on a modular basis via add-on robots: Start with our main robot and dynamically adjust SynBioWave's functionality to your needs by adding add-on robots to the wave (see our user guide for detailed instructions).
Below is a list of the most important add-on robots we created. Click the boxes to go to the user guides for the robots featuring a video tutorial for each robot.
Alignment Robot
The Alignment robot is capable of comparing two sequences using global or local alignments.
Translation Robot
The Translation Robot finds open reading frames (ORFs) and translates them into protein.
REBase Robot
The ReBase robot helps you find out where restriction enzymes attach to your sequence and cut.
Primer Designer
The Primer Designer helps you design primers for PCR.
Blast Robot
The Blast robot uses the NCBI blast service to perform Blast searches.
Codon Usage Robot
The Organism likelihood Robot shows you how likely a sequence originates from a certain organism.
Special: Sequence View Gadget
To be precise, the new Sequence View Gadget is not a separate robot, but part of the SynBioWave main robot. Nonetheless we want to present it in this context because it demonstrates how powerful Gadgets made with Google Web Toolkit (GWT) are and how the future of SynBioWave might look like.
