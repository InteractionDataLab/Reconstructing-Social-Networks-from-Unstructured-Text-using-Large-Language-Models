SynBioWave is entirely open source. On this page we will show you how you can access the code. Normally our project is hosted on Sourceforge in addition we uploaded the latest program code to the iGEM wiki.
The SynBioWave Robot and Development Library (synbiowave@appspot.com)
The SynBioWave robot is the main robot. One has to add it before he uses the Add-on robots.

Add-On Robots
The Translation Robot(translate-beta@appspot.com)
The Translation robot finds Open Reading Frames (ORFs) and translates them into Protein.
The source code can be downloaded from here .
The Alignment Robot (alignbot@appspot.com)
The Alignment robot compares two sequences using global and local alignments.
The source code can be downloaded from here .
The REBase Robot (resenzymes-beta@appspot.com)
The REBase robot finds where in the sequence the restriction sites attach and where they cut.
The source code can be downloaded from here .
The Primer Design Robot (synbiowave-primerdesign@appspot.com)
The Primer Design Robot designs primers for PCRs.
The source code can be downloaded from here .
The Codon Usage Robot (likelihoodbot@appspot.com)
The Codon Usage Robot shows how likely the sequence originates from the selected organism.
