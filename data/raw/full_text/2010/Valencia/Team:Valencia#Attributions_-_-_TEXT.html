The prion circuit that we have used in the Regulating Mars Temperature part of our project was developed by Li and Lindquist (2000). But we were the first to use it in a terraforming context and think about its extraordinaries possibilities and applications in Synthetic Biology. We also have made a BioBrick based in the prion.
We obtained pET28a plasmid containing soybean’s PM2 gene from Yun Liu and colleges (Liu et al, 2010) and transformed BL21 E.coli strain with it. In order to prove protective effects of this gene we followed the methods of the named publication, adding more combinations of harsh temperatures than the authors did, although we did not carry out any study related to high-salinity tolerance of E.coli expressing the PM2 protein. We also differentiated between bacteria growing without glycerol and those with 8% glycerol. Instead of using t- statistical analysis, we carried out a non-parametrical test (Kruskal-Wallis) for each one of the four treatments. We also tried to transform yeast with PM2 gene; however, due to some experimental problems, we did not manage to do it.
We based our Yeastworld model in a pre-existing static model called Daisyworld developed by Watson and Lovelock (1983). We modified and spread the model to make it dynamic, to include the prion behaviour and to apply it to a terraforming proccess.
The rest the parts of our project (see, for example, the Mars Simulation Chamber, the Microbial Albedo Recorder and the Red House experiments, the Human Practices and Safety sections) were entirely designed, developed and put into test by us.
