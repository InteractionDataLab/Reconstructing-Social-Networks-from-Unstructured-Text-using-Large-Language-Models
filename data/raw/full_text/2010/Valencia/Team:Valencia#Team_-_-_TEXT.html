Most of us have backgrounds in Biology, Biotechnology, Chemistry, Engineering and Computer Sciences. We want to discover the enigmas of Synthetic Biology and now also the ones tha Mars puts on the table!!!! Go to The Team page for more info on us. In the Notebook you can follow up our work in progress!!! and in Gallery you can see a bunch of pictures of the team working.
