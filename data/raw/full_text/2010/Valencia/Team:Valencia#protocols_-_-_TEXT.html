Protocols and Methodes
Verification protocol of resistance with LEA
Preculture
Take two tubes of 25 ml and add 5 ml of LB in both of them.
Add 5µl of kannamicine in each tube.
Inoculate in each tube a colony corresponding E. coli (with LEA and without LEA).
Maintain the tubes during 8 hours at 37 ºC and 250 rpm.
Culture overnight of liquid medium
Take two flasks of 500 ml and add 50µl of kannamicine in both flasks.
Inoculate 500µl of corresponding preculture.
Maintain the flask incubator at 37ºC and 250 rpm.
Measure of OD of culture and dilution to exponential growth zone
Measure of the OD of each culture.
Dilution the cultures with LB fresh to OD of 0.5.
Grow the cultures to OD of 0.6.
Induction with IPTG
Add IPTG to 1mM final concentration.
Incubate, both cultures, during 4 hours at 37 ºC and 250 rpm.
Adjust of OD
Measure the OD of each culture.
Adjust the OD of both cultures at 0.4.
Add glycerol
Extract three aliquots, for each culture, corresponding to the different concentrations of glycerol (the volumes are calculated for glycerol to 99,5%):
0% glycerol: take 50 ml of culture and nothing of glycerol.
8% glycerol: take 4 ml of glycerol and 56 % and 46 ml of culture.
50% glycerol: take 25.3 ml of glycerol and 24.7 ml of culture.
Prepare these premixes with tubes of 50 ml (only for mixing).
Separate the cultures for the different conditions
Extract twelve 1 ml aliquots from each stock of 50 ml.
Spread to count initial colonies
Take 1 ml of each 50mL stock.
Prepare serial dilutions of each 1 ml of the samples:
1/1,000
1/5,000
1/25,000
1/125,000
Spread (with glass beads)LB plates (without antibiotic) with 100 µl for each dilutions.
Stress by extremely conditions
Low temperatures during 2 hours and high temperatures during 45’
Take 1 ml of sample of each culture after each completed cycle.
Prepare serial dilution of each sample:
1/1,000
1/5,000
1/25,000
1/125,000
