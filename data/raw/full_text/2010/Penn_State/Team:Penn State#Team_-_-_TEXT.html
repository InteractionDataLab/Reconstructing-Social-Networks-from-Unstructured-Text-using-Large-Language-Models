What we did
The Penn State iGEM team had bi-weekly meetings prior to the end of the spring semester. We then went home for a small break until reconvening May 24th. During the first week, we had training under the supervision of Mike Speer and Amin Espah. During our training week, we learned the procedures and protocols to Mini-prepping, running digests, running PCRs, doing Gel Electrophoresis, Gel extractions and purifications, Ligations, and finally, Transformations.
In addition to this, Mike taught us how to make the necessary medias in which we could grow our transformed E. coli and parts. We were taught proper lab etiquette and safety techniques to insure that we, and everyone around, would be safe.
We were introduced to the Parts Registry and online articles to help us decide what project we wished to do. After researching for an extent of time, we chose a project dealing with Oxygen sensitive promoters.
