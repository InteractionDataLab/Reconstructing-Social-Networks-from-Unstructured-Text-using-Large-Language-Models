About our lab
a)Do you handle different materials in different work environments? If yes, please describe what materials you handle in what work environments.
Yes. We inoculate and culture the E-coli in the clean bench. We extract plasmid in open bench and we use the volatile liquid in draught cupboard.
b) Do you use different protective equipment for different procedures? If yes, please describe what equipment you use for what purposes.
Yes. For example, we use a board to protect ourselves from the X-ray when we are doing gel extraction under the gel imager
c)How do you dispose of biological waste? (For example: liquid cell cultures, agar plates, used pipette tips.)
We will sterilize the liquid cell cultures, pour them in bins and school will gather and dispose them. We will sterilize the agar plates and used pipette tips before we throw them away.
Local Rules and Regulations
a) Who is responsible for biological safety at your institution? (You might have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, an Office of Environmental Health and Safety, a single Biosafety Officer, or some other arrangement.) Have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised, and any changes you made in your project based on your discussion
We have Laboratory And Equipment Department at our institution which is responsible for our biological safety.The officers have inspected our laboratory and gave us suggestions about biosafety, which were already fulfilled as request.
b) Please give a link to the laboratory safety training requirements of your institution (college, university, community lab, etc).

c)What are the biosafety guidelines of your institution? Please give a link to these guidelines, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link

d)In your country, what are the regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories? Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.

Risks of Your Project
a) Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
The engineered strains used in this project are the most commonly used E. coli which  may cause diarrhea, if used carelessly.
b) Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):
The E.coli strains may cause diarrhea,however we have inactivated all the strains strictly after experiments.
c) Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab).
The E.coli strains used in our project are of low risk to the environment and we are making every effort to minimize the possible risks.
d) Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
No,since all the engineered strains are frequently used by researchers all over the world and mostly exist in laboratory environments.
e) What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
During the operation, the researchers are required to wear protective gears and we will inactivate all the strains strictly after experiments.
