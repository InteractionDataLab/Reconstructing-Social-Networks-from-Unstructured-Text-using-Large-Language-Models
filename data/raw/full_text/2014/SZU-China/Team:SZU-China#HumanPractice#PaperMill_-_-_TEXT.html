Paper Mill
To industrialize the proceeding of decontamination, our team visited a small-sized Paper Mill which is located in Jieyang, Guangdong Providence in August. This paper mill actually specialized in Wastepaper Deinking, but they still adopted chemical process which had caused fearful heavy metal pollution in the surroundings.
However, our alkaline cellulase is able to enhance the technique and reduce the pollution, for this reason our team decided to add it into the process of deinking. The enzyme must be more meeting the request of environmental protection than chemistry.
To ensure the proceeding of industry is GREEN. Cellulase should adapt to the alkaline situation and easy to get. Our team is making every effort to reach this aim.
