Collaboration
This is the first year that SZU_iGEM enter this competition.
SUSTC-Shenzhen has an experience in the competition last year and they had a good result. Thus, we invited them to a meetup in Shenzhen University on 19th July. They gave us some advices in how to registry a team and explain the medal criteria. Also, they suggested us to add a suicide system in our project. As feedback, we gave them instruction on lab safety and experimental skills. For example, we instructed them to use the flow cytometry and freeze-dry the sample in the PCR tube. During this meetup, we exchanged many ideas and also had great fun. We want to thank SUSTC-Shenzhen a lot for giving us so many useful instructions and helps.
ETZ Zurich invited us to participate in their survey related to complexity. Our team members completed the survey. As feedback, ETZ Zurich gave us a badge.
