Communication
Communicate with SUSTC
At the beginning of August, our team invited another iGEM team came from South University of Science and Technology of China to our college. We carried on a detailed communication about our project and exchanged some views.
This exchange promoted improvement of our project. Team members rectified and ascertained our final plan.
iGEM High School Meetup in Hongkong
Our team had joined in the iGEM High School Meetup in Hongkong on account of comprehending iGEM deeper. On this meetup our teammates came in contact with some high school iGEM teams, such as Team Shenzhen_SFLS come from Shenzhen Foreign Language School, and listened with their projects were, how their projects went on.
This meetup helped our teammate get a more comprehensive understanding of iGEM and we checked our project quicker.
