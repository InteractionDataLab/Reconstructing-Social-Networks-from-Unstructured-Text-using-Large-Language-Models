Cultural Festival
This Cultural Day is a traditional annual activity of our Life Science College and everybody in Shenzhen University is welcomed to take part in it.
On the day, our team got a stall, projected some video clips of iGEM and set a quiz part. By asking a few simple questions, our team approximately gathered some data. The statistics suggested that nearly 90% of our round person had never been in contact with iGEM or Synthetic Biology before.
Whatever, we initially acquire the conception of Synthetic Biology in Shenzhen University.
