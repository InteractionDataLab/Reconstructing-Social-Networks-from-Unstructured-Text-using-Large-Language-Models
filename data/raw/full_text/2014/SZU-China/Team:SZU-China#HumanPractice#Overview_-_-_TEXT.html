Overview
             
                     
As all the world can see, Chinese economic has developed rapidly. However, together with this developing, the environment of China gets worse gradually,especially in some small private mills in the south of China. Because of lacking of the consciousness of environmental protection, the mills use a lot of toxic chemicals during the deinking. In the same time, they pour the waste water into the river and sea straightly. Fortunately, Chinese were starting conscious of environmental protection. The rise of synthetic biology provides a new way to solve this type of environmental question. But in China, synthetic biology, including iGEM, is a new course, most of Chinese don't know or understand it clearly.

Thus, we didn't spend all our summer in the lab, we also considered our project and iGEM in a wider context. We used some human practice activities to make people know the basic theory of the synthetic biology and the connection with sustainable development. Meanwhile, our team also went to the small private mill and introduced our project to them. Very good feedbacks were obtained from them. We wanted to make them know that using synthetic biology during the process of papermaking would decrease the consumption of the toxic chemicals,  protect our environment and realize sustainable development.        .
