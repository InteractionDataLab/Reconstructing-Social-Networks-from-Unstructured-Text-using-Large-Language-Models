Shenzhen University international genetically engineered
     machine competition (iGEM) questionnaire
Our investigation is mainly propaganda of synthetic biology, iGEM, and the investigation on cellulase understanding people. We designed a total of 12 questions. Here are some of the survey results.
Q1  Do you know iGEM ?
From the survey results, a majority of people do not understand the iGEM, about accounted for only about twenty percent. Description of iGEM in Chinese visibility is not high, but it can be understood. Because of this competition is the contest for university students, Chinese higher education degree is not universal, and biology students in China less.
Q2 what is your attitude to gene engineering technology?
From the result of the survey, more than seventy percent of the people support the gene engineering technology. That gene technology more good than harm. That people still hope that the support of gene technology, gene technology will develop better and better.
Q3   Do you think what is the application of cellulase?
Cellulase was applied in swage treatment, food industry, paper industry, most of the people know. Only a few people think that used in metallurgy industry and electronic industry, estimated their cultural level is not high, there is no concept of cellulase. Generally speaking, everyone on the cellulase application areas understand well, that our project is close to the practical application.
Q4 What do you think the development of Bio Industry in twenty-first Century?
Although said Bio Industry in twenty-first Century the most development potential of the industry, but because of the slow development of China in this regard, the domestic bio industry employment rate is low, the research progress of the biological aspects of the very slow. Although the people know that this is a sunrise industry, but because of the domestic development, people is not high to the biological industry confidence.
Q5 Using synthetic biology method, create an energy producing alkaline cellulase "super bacteria" is used to reduce the pollution of paper-making process on the environment, Do you think it is meaningful ?
The investigation result shows that the people of our program, to solve the pollution problem of paper-making factory is highly supported . In addition to attention to environmental problems, to use modern high-tech technology to solve environmental problems more care and support.
All in all, with the development of society, people's cultural level's enhancement, more and more people pay attention to the environment,and the importance of science and technology. Our project using synthetic biology method for cellulase production to the sewage problem governance paper factory to get the vast majority of people support. The people of the emerging biotechnology industry also has a great interest in. More and more people support the gene engineering.
