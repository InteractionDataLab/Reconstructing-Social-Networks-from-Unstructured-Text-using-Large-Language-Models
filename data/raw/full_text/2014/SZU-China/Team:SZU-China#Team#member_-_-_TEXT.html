Zhipeng Qiu
the captain of 2014 SZU-iGEM and one of the project designers. This energetic member of our team will help with anything as long as it’s not taking care of insects.
Yiting Luo
one of the core member of 2014 SZU-iGEM.She is a  very cute girl .She is also an important researcher that she participated in every step of the project.
Huan Wei
I’m a  Junior student at the Shenzhen University , very glad to participate in 2014-IGEM. This summer, IGEM brings us not only a synthetic biology knowledge, the more important thing is the team cooperation ability. We have a headache for the failure of the experiment over and over again, and cheered for every step of the experiment a success. Because of IGEM, we learned too much. We fully enjoy the whole summer.
BigStone(Heng Shi)
I am a senior student. This is my first time to attend IGEM. I am responsible for experiment operates parts. In this activity, I learned how to build a team, how to start IGEM, The project had been difficult and tedious, and members of my team had stayed at the laboratory until midnight each night for weeks to finish Experiment. I believe that my team will be better and better.
Zeyu Miao
I am a junior student majoring in Life Sciences in SZU. I am interested in life science. I always believe that one will easily lag behind unless he keeps on learning, therefore I would like to continue my study in this field. Work independently, mature and resourceful are my style, of course, I will responsible and diligent in any project I undertake through my hardworking. Whatever is worth doing is worth doing well. I have been ready to accept the challenge and I come here to fulfill myself.
Solar (Zirui Yue)
I’m so honored to participate in 2014 iGEM competition. This game gives me a chance to contact with Synthesis Biology and many different competitors, including schoolmates come from different grade and people come from other universities. Actually doing biological experiments is so cool. I had attended a small group to establish Suicide Part and then converted to design Wiki Web of our whole project.
Angleo (Zhao Shangguan)
Where there is a will ,there is a way.
Kee (Qi Li)
Keep on going never give up.
Yongyi Wang
My name is Wang Yongyi.I am a junior student from shenzhen university college of life science. Others call me the yongyiguagua! I am a experimenter in SZU - iGEM team and I am mainly responsible for the progress of the experiment and data processing. I also go through the photoshop, edit pictures, etc at my free time. I like outdoor activities, like to play golf and swimming. My swimming technology is not so  excellent, but I enjoy it like doing the experiment.
Jenny(Lin Zhang)
I am very glad to join the game of IGEM in last few months. I gain lots of fun in the process of the game and I made many new friends from the game. We were always work together in the lab from morning to night. Even very tired but we find pleasure in it. Because of game we need a lot of knowledge of molecular biology, so we spent so much time to search the knowledge of molecular and learn how to design a experiment. At last we let our knowledge bank abundantly. In the game, I am in charge of the part of promoter, we need to gain the P43 promoter from bacillus subtilis and guide into escherichia coli. In the process we faced many times of failure, but through our attempted we found way to solve the problem at last.
Monica (Yating Wan)
I’m member of suicide team. The aims of our team that bacterial will be dead as our willingness. We cut gene segment of Ccdb out and linked it after promoter. Finally, if we put IPTG ,the bacterial will be dead.  get through this competition I not only improve my ability of cooperate with others but also learn about Molecular Biology and elementary operation.In a word, IGEM is a fantastic competition.
Steven (Diwen Shi)
Hello! My name is Steven. In this project, I was a member in web design. Writing details, such as overview, abstract and design, was my job. During the process, not only my English but my computer skills have improved a lot. The experience in iGEM left a deep impression on me.
Jierui Chen
Do one thing at a time, and do well.
Yuanyuan Xu
I am Yuanyuan Xu,a junior from Shenzhen University majoring in Life Science.  I am fond of traveling and reading .Traveling is a wonderful way to broaden our horizons and experience different culture. And we can learn how to face up with difficulties and how to live a meaningful life by reading. Taking part in iGEM, I understand the significant of cooperation, which is crucial to success of the whole project. Additionally, a correct direction plays an important role in the process. More importantly, I gradually have courage to deal with barriers. As the saying goes, where there is a will, there is a way.
Atseway (Wei Xie)
It was really unforgettable and worthwhile spending  one year to finish our projects with my team,SZU-iGem.This term ,I become a junior student and major in Biology Science.Interested in synthetic biology but knowing little about it,I decided to study synthetic biology and now I’m fascinated in it deeply.I participated in establishing KIL part and MDFA part which were key structures in our projects during the whole summer holiday in 2014.Meanwhile I contacted iGem team of South University of S(SUSTC),we held a meeting to share ideas and experience on iGem,which I learned a lot from them.Anyway,there is no end of studying synthetic biology .I’m pround of our team cooperation and always want to be the one who is ready to take challenge and and find incredible joy in the next coming process.
Zhenyao Ye
My name is Ye Zhenyao, the English name is Yao. I am a member of a group called CcdB . I managed to make a perfect part which is CcdB ,a toxic protein,of our team with my other four members.
Hui Ai
Aihui is interested in biology and biotech. She is an enthusiastic supporter of open science and is glad to participate in projects like iGEM.
Jim (Junming Zhan)
I am the only one in this team who is not majoring in biology.But in this summer,I learned a lot knowledge about synthetic biology and made a lot of friends.I am really love this amazing team.
