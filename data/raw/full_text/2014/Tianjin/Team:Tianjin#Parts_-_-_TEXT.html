BBa_K1361000
Based on the concept that change of cell  motility by control of CheZ chemotaxis regulator could disturb pre-expressed  curli fiber structure, we assume that if the inducer occurs, in this case  acacia, CsgB protein will secrete into extracellular and act as nucleator to  recruit soluble CsgA monomer into amyloid fibres, and the transcription of CheZ  will be downgrade via cI-Plamda NOT gate. If induction condition disappears at  a certain point, suppression of CheZ will be discharged. As a result, cells  will be more moveable thus disturb or inhibit the establishment of curli  structure. And in our final device, the dynamic detection could achieve by  monitoring current change between two electrodes in the culture.
BBa_K1361001
This part contains the major subunit of  curli fiber CsgA and its nucleator CsgB, in which CsgA is constitutive  expression(a relatively weak promoter compared to BBa_K1361003) whereas CsgB is  under the control of T7 promotor. This part cannot functioning alone without  expression of CsgEFG genes in the same cell, for they coding the outer membrane  channel secrete system for CsgA and CsgB.
BBa_K1361002
This part contains the major subunit of  curli fiber CsgA and its nucleator CsgBtrunc, in which CsgA is constitutive  expression whereas CsgBtrunc is under the control of Pbad promotor. CsgBtrunc  is different from native CsgB for the deletion of C-terminal amino acid from  133 to 155 so that it cannot attach cell outer membrane. And CsgBtrunc itself  is highly aggregative in the culture. This part is designed for immediate  generation of large amount of curli fiber after adding the inducer. This part  cannot function alone without the expression of CsgEFG genes in the same cell,  for they coding the outer membrane channel secrete system for CsgA and CsgB.
BBa_K1361003
This part contains the major subunit of  curli fiber CsgA and its nucleator CsgB, in which CsgA is constitutive  expression(a relatively strong promoter compared to BBa_K1361001) whereas CsgB  is under the control of T7 promoter. This part cannot function alone without  expression of CsgEFG genes in the same cell, for they coding the outer membrane  channel secrete system for CsgA and CsgB.
BBa_K1361004
This part contains the major subunit of  curli fiber CsgA-his (CsgA modified by His tag) and its nucleator CsgB, in  which CsgA-his is constitutive expression whereas CsgB is under the control of  Pbad promoter. This part is designed for immediate generation of large amount  of curli fiber after the adding of the inducer and the purification of CsgA by Ni-NTA  reign or absorbing Au-NTA-Ni nano partial. This part cannot function alone  without expression of CsgEFG genes in the same cell, for they coding the outer  membrane channel secrete system for CsgA and CsgB.
BBa_K1361005
This part contains CsgE, CsgF, CsgG, which  serve as the outer membrane secrete device for curli fiber, at relatively low  constitutive. This part is for specific transport of CsgA(BBa_K1361999) and CsgB(BBa_K1361997)  into extracellular matrix. CsgEFG(BBa_K1361992) was placed after a relatively  weak constitutive promoter.
BBa_K1361006
This part contains the major subunit of  curli fiber CsgA and its nucleator CsgBtrunc (a dissociative nucleator), in  which CsgA is constitutive expression whereas CsgBtrunc is under the control of  Pbad promoter. CsgBtrunc is different from native CsgB for the deletion of  C-terminal amino acid from 133 to 155 so that it cannot attach cell outer  membrane. And CsgBtrunc itself is highly aggregative in the culture. This part  is designed for immediate generation of large amount of curli fiber after the adding  of the inducer, and a stronger promoter for CsgA was chosen to parallel with  BBa_K1361002. This part cannot function alone without expression of CsgEFG  genes in the same cell, for they coding the outer membrane channel secrete  system for CsgA and CsgB.
BBa_K1361007
This part contains the major subunit of  curli fiber CsgA-his CsgA modified by His tag) and its  nucleator CsgB, in which CsgA-his is constitutive expression whereas CsgB is  under the control of Pbad promoter. This part is designed for immediate generation  of large amount of curli fiber after adding of the inducer and the purification  of CsgA by Ni-NTA reign, or absorbing Au-NTA-Ni nano partical. This part cannot  function alone without expression of CsgEFG genes in the same cell, for they  coding the outer membrane channel secrete system for CsgA and CsgB.
②Achievements
Requirements for the Bronze  and Silver Medal:
√Register the team, have a  great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
√Successfully complete and  submit this iGEM 2014 Judging form.
√Create and share a  Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts  using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
√Plan to present a Poster and  Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
√The description of each  project have clearly attribute work done by the us and distinguish it from work  done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors,  professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
√Document more than one new  standard BioBrick Part or Device central to our project and submit these parts  to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
√Experimentally validate that  new BioBrick Part or Device of our own design and construction works as  expected.
√Document the  characterization of new parts in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's  Registry entry.
√Submit this new part to the  iGEM Parts Registry (submissions have been adhere to the iGEM Registry  guidelines)
√We carried out several human  practice activities, such as a visit to TIB,CAS (Tianjin Institute of  Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences), a regular newsletter  with more than 20 iGEM teams all over the world and a nationwide questionnaire  focus on the spread of synthetic biology. Besides, we have done mutual help  with NKU and BIT iGEM teams in terms of experimental instructions and future  applications.
Additional Requirements for  a Gold Medal:
√We have helped Beijing  Institute of Technology( BIT ) team to model their MIN system, using a  classical density-dependent growth model for the population of E.coli growing  simulation. Also we use some other differential equations to describe the  dynamic change of AHL, LuxR proteins and MinC proteins. Apart from that, we  helped Xiamen University (XMU) team start the regular newsletters with over 20  teams around the world.
√Our project has the  implications for the nanowire devices focus on the bio-signal transformation.  Our project provides a novel and controllable method to diversify the output  methods of biosensor, though at a preliminary stage. With future work, a more  stable, sensitive and economical device should be promising.
