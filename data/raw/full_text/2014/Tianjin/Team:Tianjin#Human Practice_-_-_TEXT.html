①Weekly Newsletter
In order to know more about iGEM teams all  around the world and enhance the cooperation among us, we have joined the  Weekly Newsletter launched by Xiamen   University and become one  of the first teams to collaborate with them on this activity.
The  newsletter usually has two major parts: project update and team stories. We should  be writing about one of the parts every two weeks. What’s more, we share funny  stories about our experiments and members. Through this activity, all the teams  will be able to keep better record of their own projects, gain feedback from  their peers and get to know other young synthetic biologists.
②A Nationwide Questionnaire
In  order to investigate the spread and uptake of synthetic biology and IGEM  competition in universities, we made a survey on the internet, through a  wide-spread and professional platform for online questionnaire survey,  Questionnaire star. We promote our questionnaire within the scope of all  colleges in China  as far as possible. According to the investigation, students coming from  hundreds of schools have participated in the survey, including not only high  school and undergraduate students, but also graduate students. So we can  roughly believe that the results are authentic.
According  to our results, we can see that the great majority of the respondents are  undergraduate students, 1.24% of them are high school students and 0.62% are  graduate students. There are also 1.86% staffs and 3.73% other people. On the  other hand, 52.8% of them are men while 47.2% of them are women.
How  many people know about the concept of synthetic biology? We are very pleased to  find 40.37% respondents answered “yes”. As for the question, “Do you know some  applications of synthetic biology in our contemporary life?” 44.1% people  illustrate that synthetic biology has not yet entered their lives. 52.17% said  they have their own?? comprehension;  synthetic biology has been involved in many areas in life. We can see that only  3.73% people understand synthetic biology very well; synthetic biology has got  great achievements in pharmaceutical, bio-energy, medical and many other fields.  Faced with safety issues of synthetic biology, 40.37% people indicate that they  would follow scientific principles to support the development of synthetic  biology. While 55.28% people support precautionary principle, emphasizing the  necessity to improve the supervision mechanism. 4.35% showed an attitude that  they do not care the safety problem, they will use as long as they can be  applied to life.
78.88%  people think people should be involved in the supervision and management of  biotechnology. 21.12% people disagree; they hold that people are so lack of  relevant biological knowledge that they cannot have a comprehensive  understanding of science.
If you have the opportunity to learn  synthetic biology-related courses and take part in IGEM, would you like to have  a try? 57.14% people answered yes, they expressed an willingness to have a try,  but do not attempt to spend too much time or energy. However, 24.84% people are  very glad to join IGEM. There are also 18.01% people that are not very  interested in it. If people have taken part in an IGEM team, 36.02% of them want  to study the environment and energy direction. 50.31% people are interested in  medical and pharmaceutical direction. 9.94% people suggest to study  agriculture, and green manufacturing direction. Whereas, 3.73% people prefer to  study other directions.
If you can assemble the gene sequences of  different modules to customize an e. coli with special features are various,  what functions do you want to realize most? The answers are various, to treat  diseases, prevent cancer, lose weight, generate electricity, etc.
What  is the most urgent problem that synthetic biology should solve? We designed four answers: treatment and prevention of human  diseases, command of environment pollution, efficient energy production,  construction of appropriate ethical system. The results are as follows:
It is obvious that  the great majority people support “treatment and prevention of human diseases”  as the most urgent problem. “command of environment pollution” are in the  second place, followed by “efficient energy production”. “Construction of  appropriate ethical system” was the least.
From this questionnaire, we can easily draw  the conclusion that synthetic biology has been developed to some extent in  universities in contemporary China,  but not very well. The great majority of people do not know synthetic biology  or IGEM at all, according to our data. To our relief, most people already have  some comprehension to synthetic biology. Although faced with safety issues,  many people showed a supportive attitude to the development of synthetic  biology. A large percent of people hold the belief that they should possess the  power to monitor it. Frankly speaking, there’s a long way to go before  realizing people’s demand. There being a vast part of people have the desire to  join IGEM, we hope that synthetic biology could be understood by more people,  we hope people with such dreams could be able to achieve their goals one day,  we hope those worries that people have about synthetic biology could be solved  earlier, we hope that more robust management system could be established as  soon as possible. As great fans of synthetic biology, as students with great  dreams of Tianjin   University, we will  spread knowledge of synthetic biology heart and soul. We believe synthetic  biology will have a better future tomorrow!
③Interaction Activities
（1） Visit to TIB,CAS
On July 31, 2014, our team visited Tianjin  Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy  of Sciences, sharing some perspectives of our project and discussing the  direction of further application.
After providing them with our preliminary  plan, we consulted professors there on our weakness and difficulties,  concentrating on the potential applications of our project. In addition to the  detection of the concentration of certain micro-molecules or macro-molecules,  we were inspired that we may also measure the expression level of different  promoters by using our platforms.
Though  we know our team may be faced with a lot of difficulties from our visit, we  also enjoyed the special tour. New ideas can be inspired through good  communication. It provided us with a great opportunity to know deeper about our  projects and synthetic biology.
 
（2） Communication with BIT
On September 18, 2014, our team came to Beijing  Institute of Technology (BIT) for a brief discussion on our projects. We each  made a presentation and exchanged the ideas on both. Through their  illustrating, we were well impressed by general idea and delicate design of their  project. Apart from the project, we also consulted Professor Zhang Xunwen from School of Aerospace Engineering on some  experimental devices, namely an ammeter with accuracy at a magnitude of 10-12.  Though we didn’t get the proper device at last, we gained a lot of helpful  suggestions. We did learn a lot!
This meeting helped us come to a better  understanding and not only of the limitations of our project itself but also of  the innovative thinking for developing an overarching structure for a new  biological system.
（3）Cooperation with NKU iGEM 2014
We carried out a work of mutually help  collaborating with Nankai   University iGEM Team. We planned  to help each other in several ways. To begin with, we launched a exchange  conference in Oct 13, 2014. Both team made a brief introduction about the  project firstly. Through their illustration, we were pleased to know that their  project is about the synthesis of rhamnolipid from microbes to assist the oil  exploitation. Then our team introduced our project and shared the experiences  and difficulties on the experiments. In the following part of “Prospecting”, we  exchanged our idea about our project on potential applications and blueprinted  our further cooperation.
In  addition, due to the lack of experiences and related laboratory reagents, we  were not able to do SDS-PAGE to identify our target protein and roughly  estimate its concentration. So they helped us do the SDS-PAGE and analyze the  results. We were very grateful about that!
④Collaborations
In this busy but unforgettable summer, we  have devoted our greatest passion; put all the thoughts in the iGEM  competition, so as the companions from other universities, I believe. Luckily,  however, we utilized our strengths to aid members of the iGEM community and  received considerable kind and helpful instructions from other teams so that we  can get through many tough moments or come up with new ideas by these joint  efforts.
Collaboration  with Beijing Institute of Technology（BIT）
BIT iGEM team and our team have collaborated  in mutual.
①Firstly, we helped them in  the modeling part. In their MIN system, some AHL was added to the medium at  first. AHL combines with the product of luxR, and they act in concert to  repress the function of promoter R0063. As a result, the MIN system cannot  work. However, AHL will be degraded by the proteins expressed by Aii gene. As  the population of E.coli grows, the concentration of AHL gradually decreases.  When it reaches a threshold value, AHL lose the ability to bind with the  product of luxR. Then the depression of MIN will be removed. MinC proteins and  MinD proteins can bind with each other to form MinCD division inhibitors. The  inhibitors can prevent cell division process. After some time, the number of  cells that are still able to make binary fission will decrease. Eventually all  the cells lose the ability to multiply themselves.
We use a classical model, density-dependent  growth model, for our population of E.coli growing simulation. Also we use some  other differential equations to describe the dynamic change of AHL, LuxR  proteins and MinC proteins. The total equations are as follows:
 
M
The    concentration of total MinC proteins
N
Cell    density
R
The    concentration of total proteins[LuxR]
A
The    number of AHL signal
k
Growth    constant
kA
The    binding rate between AHL and LuxR proteins
kM
Production    rate of MinC.
kR
The    production rate of LuxR proteins
d
The    death rate related with MinC proteins.
di
The    degradation rate of materials.
Then we use these equations to simulate the function  of MIN system. The results are shown as figure 1 and figure 2.
 
Figure 1. The dynamic change of  cell number and total number of LuxR proteins. After a sharp increase, the cell  stopped multiplying themselves. With the growing of E.coli, the total number of  LuxR proteins also increases. The initial value of cell number we set is 3000.
 
Figure 2. The dynamic change of MinC  proteins and AHL signal. The AHL decrease very quickly with the growth of  E.coli. And when AHL comes to the threshold value, the repression of MinC is  removed. So after some time the MinC proteins increase quickly and the cell  division process is inhibited.
 
②In  turn, they have helped us in the measurements of the parts. We send their  sample of K1361007, in which CsgA, the major subunit of curli fiber modified by  twin 7Xhis tag, is under control of a strong constitutive promoter BBa_J23100.  And the K1361007 was arrived in company with a parallel part where BBa_J23104,  a relatively weaker promoter, replaced the BBa_J23100. In order to find the  better fit of promoter, they helped us measure the cell growth curve of each  part and Bradford protein assay was adopted to  monitor the total quantity of secrete protein in matrix.
The  results are as follows:
 
Figure 3.Cell growth curve of  BBa_J23100 and parallel that a relatively weaker promoter was used to control  the CsgA secrete level
 
Figure 4. Absorbency of  secrete protein in culture between K1361007 and parallel. No significant  divergence was found.

Collaboration  with Nankai University(NKU)
We  hosted the 1st  iGEM Exchange  Conference Of TJU Team and NKU Team on Oct. 14th at the Nankai University.
The conference contains three parts: The introduction of Work  Project, Prospect and Mutual Aid.
First of all, mediators of both teams introduced their project.  Nankai University Team introduced their project called Super Petroleum Magician  which is an anaerobic rhamnolipid-producing engineered bacterial strain for  microbial enhanced oil recovery.
And Tianjin University Team  gave a speech about their program named Transfibre which is also called CsgA, a  kind of special fiber that can bind the electric circuit and play the role as  the conductor as its function.
In the experiment part, they helped us to detect our target protein  (CsgA) using SDS-PAGE. Here is the result.
From the result, we could see that the interest protein from cells  was about 15 Kp which was same as what we expected, from which we could infer  that interest protein unsurely existed.
