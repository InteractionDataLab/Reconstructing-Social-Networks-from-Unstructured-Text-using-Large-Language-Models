①The safety of lab
Alarm bells
According to the Ministry of Education “2008-2009  General Undergraduate Colleges Laboratory Information Statistics”, there are  26479 laboratories in 1129 total regular undergraduate colleges in China,  laboratory area 2 6.015 million m2. With so many  laboratories, safety accidents have occured from time to time. In 2009, a  university teacher of the department of chemistry mistakenly accessed CO gas  into 307 lab, which should have been accessed to 211 lab. A woman doctor died  because of this fault; In 2010, students and teachers of a university in  northeast of China used goats without being checked in their experiments, which  lead 27 students and 1 teacher were diagnosed as infected with brucellosis; In  2013,  a postgraduate student named Huang Yang from Fudan University died  of poisoning in Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital. According to the report of the  police's investigation, a toxic chemical compound was found in the drinking  water dispenser in Huang's dormitory room, and this toxic chemical compoud is  taken out of a laboratory.
Ponder why
——Why do such tragedies repeat again and again?
These terrible incidents are not mere  coincidences and it reminds us college students of the importance of  lab-safety. Thus we studied a large number of reports and literature to analyze  the causes of? laboratory accidents.  First of all, leaders and managers pay insufficient attention is the main  reason. Second, management system and mechanism are not sound. Lacking of  safety consciousness also cannot be neglected in causing safety problems. Last  but not least, non-standard hardware construction is also a key reason.
reflect on our own
——What is happening to our lab?
Laboratory  safety awareness is the "Achilles heel" to our lab. Too much facts  tell us that most accidents are caused by negligence of researchers. Do  experiments without wearing gloves or lab coats, pile up clutter at random in  the laboratory, or eat pineapples in the laboratory during experimental  clearances. Now ask yourself, have these phenomenon happened to you or around  you on earth before?
preventive measures 
——How to avoid the occurrence of laboratory  accidents?
Laboratory safety issues can not be ignored.  Tianjin University started the “Lab-Safety Month of Tianjin  University”under the advocation of our IGEM team since 2013. A number of activities  were held to enhance students’ safety awareness. Here, we launched the  initiative that everyone pay more attention to laboratory safety, starting from  things around us and from ourselves.
Safety Tips:
1. Always wear  appropriate personal protective equipment. Feet and legs should be covered;  sandals and open-toed shoes should not be worn in laboratories. Wear  appropriate gloves while handling infectious or toxic materials and animals. Do  not wear lab coats, gloves or other personal protective equipment outside the  laboratory. Change gloves when contaminated, and dispose of used gloves with  other contaminated laboratory waste.
2. Do not eat, drink,  smoke, handle contact lenses, apply cosmetics, or store food for human  consumption in the laboratory.
3. Wash your hands  after working with potentially hazardous materials and before leaving the  laboratory.
4. Follow the  institutional policies regarding safe handling of sharps (i.e., needles,  scalpels, pipettes, and broken glassware). Be careful with needles and  syringes. Use only when alternative methods are not feasible. Syringes,  needles, Pasteur pipettes, etc, should be placed in rigid, leak-proof  containers (Sharps Safe) and discarded following the waste rules.
5. Take care to  minimize the creation of aerosols and/or splashes.
6.Decontaminate  all work surfaces before and after your experiments, and immediately after any  spill or splash of potentially infectious material with an appropriate  disinfectant. Clean laboratory equipment routinely, even if it is not  contaminated.
7. Decontaminate  all potentially infectious materials before disposal.
8. Report any  incidents that may result in exposure to infectious materials to appropriate  personnel (e.g., laboratory supervisor, safety officer).
9. Know where the  nearest eyewash, safety shower, and fire extinguisher are located. Know how to  use them.
10. Insist upon  good housekeeping in your laboratory.
11. Check for  insects and rodents. Keep all areas clean.
12. Secure all gas  cylinders.
13. Several  species of toxic substances of biological laboratory we could often see in  laboratory:  Tris,glycine,  X-gal, β-galactosidase.
Not only we should pay more attention to  laboratory safety, but also should our governments enhance management.Welcome to visit https://2012.igem.org/Team:Tianjin/Safety for more details.
②The safety of synthetic biology
International Risk Governance Council claims  that the risks caused by synthetic biology include:
(1) environmental risks,  such as bio-security;
(2) social risks;
(3) economic risks, such as  intellectual property rights;
(4) the theoretical risks, such as natural or  unnatural products. Although synthetic biology allows we human beings to  respond to many aspects of challenges such as the global energy and  environment, its development and application process involves different levels  of security risk, which brings considerable social concern and worries.
Our survey results
To investigate the condition of synthetic  biology, we made a survey on the internet. The results show that faced with  safety issues of synthetic biology, 40.37% people indicate that they would follow scientific principles to  support the development of synthetic biology. 55.28% people support  precautionary principle, emphasizing the necessity to improve the supervision  mechanism. 4.35% showed an attitude that they do not care the safety problem,  they will use as long as they can be applied to life. As for whether should  people take part in the supervision and management of biological technology,  78.88% people answered “Yes”, 21.12% people disagree, they hold the opinion  that people are so lack of relevant biological knowledge that they cannot have  a comprehensive understanding of science.
So we can see, a large number of people have the  desire to monitor the safety of synthetic biology. But it’s obvious that in the  management of synthetic biology, ordinary people make up too small parts  now. How to solve this contradiction? Our IGEM team had a heated discussion on  this issue. First of all, our government  and educational institution should promote the education and publicity of synthetic biology, to make more  people know what is synthetic biology and what does it do. Second, when a  synthetic biology product accesses to the market, the producer must show basic principles and security of the product to the public,  which should be objective, full and accurate to make the information as  open and transparent as possible. Last but not least, we should establish a  comprehensive regulatory framework in our society, give people the rights to  supervise and manage the safety of synthetic biology.

③The safety of our project
Curli fiber  expressed by the bacterium Escherichia coli is a bacterial form of amyloid.  Amyloid fibers are associated with a variety of disease states, including prion  diseases and systemic amyloidosis. Curli fiber has a strong adhesive  power,?? can combine with the surface  material of many organisms, including fiber mucin, laminin, plasminogen and so  on. Vitro and in vivo tests showed that those bacteria? that be able to produce curli produce more  virulence than bacteria that don’t produce curli, including adhesion, planting  and invasion capacity of the host cell. E. Coli can produce curli fiber in its  mammalian host, which may bring related inflammation like sepsis to its hosts. Luckily, the synthetic curli fiber in our project is  used outside of our body, so it will not bring such safety problem. Besides, in  the intact bacterium, the expression of curli requires the concerted action of  several gene products. Understanding how curli are assembled may help in our  understanding of pathological amyloids in human disease.
Our project could be used to make  bioelectric detection, which could be applied in? the detection of some harmful substances to  the environment or our body. We hope it could make great contribution to some  hazardous substances’ safety problems in the near future.
