Instructor
1Prof.Yingjin Yuan
Professor Yingjin Yuan is the founder of iGEM  Asia platform. He and MIT worked together, and successfully promoted the iGEM  in Asia. He is also one of the first introducers of synthetic biology to China.  He has been enthusiastically supporting since iGEM in Tianjin University since  year one.
Instructor
2Dr.Bingzhi Li
Dr.  Li received his Ph.D. degree in biochemical engineering from Tianjin University  and has been on the faculty at Tianjin University School of Chemical Engineering  and Technology since 2010. He is the principle investigator for the projects  from NSFC, MOE of China, and involved in several programs from MOST of China.  He joined the first iGEM competition and has been instructing Tianjin University  iGEM teams since 2007.
Advisor
3Yue Liu
She is the only one who  is able to endure the boring sufferings of lab during the whole summer  experiment. She believes in the survival of the fittest in natural selection.  She is absolutely worthy of ‘the lab queen’.
Team leader
4Shoujie Sun
This unique boy is our  leader. He shows thundering passion when he is concentrating on scientific  research. Usually he acts introverted, but his humor and loveliness are very  near the surface.
5Jingyun Yang
Many people can tell that  she is a great dancer from her elegant appearance. She manage everything from  experiment to personnel well in a graceful manner. Besides, her English is  first-rate fluent and local.
6Baode Sun
His major is Biological Engineering. He is  responsible for experiment because of his good operational ability and enthusiasm  for precise. He is a bookworm who loves reading books silently, but also a great  debater with passion in debate competitions.
7Dongqi Bao
She is a comely girl  interested in all kinds of science, such as math and chemistry. Naturally, she  takes charge of modeling in our team. She is crazy about movies and music, and  she would gush about them excitedly.
8Wei Ling
At the rest in an  experiment, Wei would take out his harmonica and play a melodic song. He is  also a main force in our school’s football team. In our experiment, he deserves  the backbone fully.
9Jiamei Zhang:
Loving to talk about all  interesting things, she is the joy of everyone. Her funny expressions and  humorous talks can always lighten our mood. However, she often refers to  herself as ‘fresh lovely’, who knows?!
10Hui Wang:
In charge of our wiki and  poster, she can sketch like an angel. Painting and designing are her life, and  every brushstroke of hers gives the painting and design life. By the way, she  loves ‘photoshop’ all kinds of pictures, ghosts for example, lol!
11Ketong Shao:
As the only sophomore in  our team, ketong is the focus everyone plays jokes with. He is obsessed with  Japanese anime, dreaming of pretty loli day and night. When he is conducting an  experiment, he can show great chrisma.
12Cheng Chen
This chubby boy takes  charge of experiment in our team. However, his operation is often described by  Jiamei as ‘slow motions’ in movies. He is fond of rock music, but his voice is  totally awful.
13Tianyu Liu
Everyone would be impressed  with her sweet voice and bright smile. She takes charge of Human Practice and  personnel. Her motto is ‘calm down and carry on’.
14Xiaoting Cui
Xiaoting’s major is  Pharmaceutical Engineering and she is highly good at molecular simulation and  many amazing molecular models shape with her efforts.
15Yaqing Wu
Just like her nickname on  the Internet, Yaqing is as lovely as a ‘sunny pig’. She is our team’s brainpower,  in charge of searching information. She is the source of our project’s ideas.
16Huize Li
From her face, you can’t  expect this girl is responsible for programming of modeling in our team. She is  described by our little sophomore as ‘loli and lady’. She loves watching TV  series and she is chasing the hot Gujian recently.
17Yueqi Shen
This quiet girl is a  senior majoring in Biological Engineering. She is often dressed smartly, smiling  on everyone tenderly. Our experimental materials can’t be dealt well without  her efforts.
18Qingchun Song Qingchun is a pretty girl  with long brown curly hair. She has abundant professional knowledge and made  great contribution to our project. In addition, she is actually a witty talker.
19Shiyu Zhang
Shiyu’s major is Chemical  Engineering, which is far from the field of iGEM, but she is responsible for  writing essays on our wiki. To everyone’s surprise, she is crazy about football  and she can speak on it with great familiarity.
