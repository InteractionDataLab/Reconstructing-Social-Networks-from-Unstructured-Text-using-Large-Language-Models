We should  be writing about one of the parts every two weeks. What’s more, we share funny  stories about our experiments and members. Through this activity, all the teams  will be able to keep better record of their own projects, gain feedback from  their peers and get to know other young synthetic biologists.</SPAN></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><SPAN class="STYLE29"><SPAN class="STYLE62"><STRONG>②A Nationwide Questionnaire</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><P class="STYLE33">In  order to investigate the spread and uptake of synthetic biology and IGEM  competition in universities, we made a survey on the internet, through a  wide-spread and professional platform for online questionnaire survey,  Questionnaire star. We promote our questionnaire within the scope of all  colleges in China  as far as possible. According to the investigation, students coming from  hundreds of schools have participated in the survey, including not only high  school and undergraduate students, but also graduate students. So we can  roughly believe that the results are authentic.</P><P class="STYLE33">According  to our results, we can see that the great majority of the respondents are  undergraduate students, 1.24% of them are high school students and 0.62% are  graduate students. There are also 1.86% staffs and 3.73% other people. On the  other hand, 52.8% of them are men while 47.2% of them are women.</P><P class="STYLE33">How  many people know about the concept of synthetic biology? We are very pleased to  find 40.37% respondents answered “yes”. As for the question, “Do you know some  applications of synthetic biology in our contemporary life?” 44.1% people  illustrate that synthetic biology has not yet entered their lives. 52.17% said  they have their own?? comprehension;  synthetic biology has been involved in many areas in life. We can see that only  3.73% people understand synthetic biology very well; synthetic biology has got  great achievements in pharmaceutical, bio-energy, medical and many other fields.  Faced with safety issues of synthetic biology, 40.37% people indicate that they  would follow scientific principles to support the development of synthetic  biology. While 55.28% people support precautionary principle, emphasizing the  necessity to improve the supervision mechanism. 4.35% showed an attitude that  they do not care the safety problem, they will use as long as they can be  applied to life.</P><P class="STYLE33">78.88%  people think people should be involved in the supervision and management of  biotechnology. 21.12% people disagree; they hold that people are so lack of  relevant biological knowledge that they cannot have a comprehensive  understanding of science.</P><P class="STYLE33">If you have the opportunity to learn  synthetic biology-related courses and take part in IGEM, would you like to have  a try? 57.14% people answered yes, they expressed an willingness to have a try,  but do not attempt to spend too much time or energy. However, 24.84% people are  very glad to join IGEM. There are also 18.01% people that are not very  interested in it. If people have taken part in an IGEM team, 36.02% of them want  to study the environment and energy direction. 50.31% people are interested in  medical and pharmaceutical direction. 9.94% people suggest to study  agriculture, and green manufacturing direction. Whereas, 3.73% people prefer to  study other directions.</P><P class="STYLE33">If you can assemble the gene sequences of  different modules to customize an e. coli with special features are various,  what functions do you want to realize most? The answers are various, to treat  diseases, prevent cancer, lose weight, generate electricity, etc.</P><P class="STYLE33">What  is the most urgent problem that synthetic biology should solve? We designed four answers: treatment and prevention of human  diseases, command of environment pollution, efficient energy production,  construction of appropriate ethical system. The results are as follows:</P><P class="STYLE33">It is obvious that  the great majority people support “treatment and prevention of human diseases”  as the most urgent problem. “command of environment pollution” are in the  second place, followed by “efficient energy production”. “Construction of  appropriate ethical system” was the least.</P><P class="STYLE33">From this questionnaire, we can easily draw  the conclusion that synthetic biology has been developed to some extent in  universities in contemporary China,  but not very well. The great majority of people do not know synthetic biology  or IGEM at all, according to our data. To our relief, most people already have  some comprehension to synthetic biology. Although faced with safety issues,  many people showed a supportive attitude to the development of synthetic  biology. A large percent of people hold the belief that they should possess the  power to monitor it. Frankly speaking, there’s a long way to go before  realizing people’s demand. There being a vast part of people have the desire to  join IGEM, we hope that synthetic biology could be understood by more people,  we hope people with such dreams could be able to achieve their goals one day,  we hope those worries that people have about synthetic biology could be solved  earlier, we hope that more robust management system could be established as  soon as possible. As great fans of synthetic biology, as students with great  dreams of Tianjin   University, we will  spread knowledge of synthetic biology heart and soul. We believe synthetic  biology will have a better future tomorrow!</P><SPAN class="STYLE29"><STRONG class="STYLE62">③Interaction Activities</STRONG></SPAN><TABLE width="100%" border="3" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#C67B14" bgcolor="#993300"><TBODY><TR><TD bgcolor="#FFED97"><P class="STYLE33"><STRONG>（1） Visit to TIB,CAS</STRONG>

In their MIN system, some AHL was added to the medium at  first. AHL combines with the product of luxR, and they act in concert to  repress the function of promoter R0063. As a result, the MIN system cannot  work. However, AHL will be degraded by the proteins expressed by Aii gene. As  the population of E.coli grows, the concentration of AHL gradually decreases.  When it reaches a threshold value, AHL lose the ability to bind with the  product of luxR. Then the depression of MIN will be removed. MinC proteins and  MinD proteins can bind with each other to form MinCD division inhibitors. The  inhibitors can prevent cell division process. After some time, the number of  cells that are still able to make binary fission will decrease. Eventually all  the cells lose the ability to multiply themselves.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P class="STYLE33">We use a classical model, density-dependent  growth model, for our population of E.coli growing simulation.
