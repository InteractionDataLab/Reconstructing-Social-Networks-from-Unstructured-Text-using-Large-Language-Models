Model 2:
The protein production is regulated by the concentrations of inducer, repressor ,activator and the different combinations of promoters with RBSs.However, in the past the strength of a promoter and an RBS, which are the main components of transcription and translation were only defined relatively to other promoter-RBS component. It lacks a standard way to quantify the strength of promoter-RBS component as standard Biobrick.
In order to efficiently select the adequate promoters, Ribosome binding Sites(RBSs) and inducer concentrations with desired Input/output characteristics, we use the promoter- RBS libraries and the mathematical dynamic model refer in [7] to describe the protein expression in a more comprehensive way.
The figure below illustrates overview of the genetic circuit. Crucial elements and their relations are cited in the figure.

Mathematical dynamic model with identified kinetic strength of promoter-RBS is described as follow :
