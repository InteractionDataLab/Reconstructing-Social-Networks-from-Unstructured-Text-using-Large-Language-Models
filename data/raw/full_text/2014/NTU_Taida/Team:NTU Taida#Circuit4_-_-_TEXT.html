Fragrance
Inspiration :
GRASSY GREEN NOTES
We want to turn fatty acids into volatile compounds that smells fresh and pleasant. First, we catalyze desaturation of Oleic acid(18:1 Δ9) into Linoleic acid(18:2 Δ9,12) by introducing a gene that encodesΔ12 Desaturase into E.coli (FAD6).
Then we catalyze oxidation (LOX2) and hydrolysis (HPL1) of Linoleic acid(18:2 Δ9,12) to give a family of hexanal which smells fresh, generally known as “Grassy Green Notes”.
ROSE FRAGRANCE
Besides turning wasted fatty acids into fragrance, we also try to produce other fragrance from engineered E.coli. Our goal is to turn beta-carotene into rose fragrance by introducing a gene called CCD1 from Arabidopsis thaliana.
Testing Result :
Function of Rose Fragrance Generator
Method:
Submit beta-ionone standard and extract of our rose fragrance generator to Gas Chromatography (GC) respectively
Result:
Beta-ionone standard We injected the beta-ionone standard, extracted by ethyl ehanol, into Gas chromotagraphy which existed an explicit curve at 27.5 minute.
Extract of rose fragrance generator Then, we injected the sample which had been extracted by Ethyl ethanol also existed curves at around 27 minutes. However, the peak quality is not as good as standard.

Extract of rose fragrance generator
Conclusion:
Success in generating rose fragrance beta-ionone from our genetic engineered E.coli.
Background Knowledge :
Green notes are fresh and lively and they are used to make a fragrance feel crisp and sharp. Green notes very often include green leaves, tea leaves, the essence of freshly cut grass and even some marine plants. Green notes are most commonly used in sporty fragrances and summertime editions of popular perfumes.
Rose fragrance
E.coli strain MG1063:
F plasmid with a transposon, Tn1000.
pSW140K with a beta-carotene synthesis operon.
Kanamycin resistance.
E.coli strain HB101:
Without F plasmid.
pSW140K is stable in it. (Reference1)
Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (CCD1):
From Arabidopsis thaliana.
