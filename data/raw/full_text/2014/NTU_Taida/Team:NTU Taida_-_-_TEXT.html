At a Glance!
The OIL oozes and gives the skin a greasy shine, and that’s one of the most fearsome nightmare of human.
We expect ourselves to solve this problem by producing skin-care ingredients with fatty acid metabolism related gene circuits, skin-guardians. In our project, we have three we have three different approaches: skin whitening, corneum decomposition and fragrance producing. When skin-guardians uptake excess oil and sebum through fadL, it will synthesis Acetyl Coenzyme A, which will change the structure of repressor, fadR losing its affinity to promoter, allowing downstream genes to be transcripted. The skin-care ingredient make us looks fair and tender. Living through theoretically and practical examinations, our skin- guardians proofed itself to be a great expectations in aesthetic Medicine.
