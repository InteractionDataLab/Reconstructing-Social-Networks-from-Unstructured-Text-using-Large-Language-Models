In modeling , we focus on the interpretation of experimental data and predict the outcomes with different initial conditions, which means different initial concentration of fatty acid.
Our Simulation Progress
1. Prediction of fundamentals of exfoliation circuit
In our circuit design of exfoliation, one of core concept is using lambda repressor(CI) to regulate the gene expression of keratinase. We have written a script in matlab to simulate this system repression according to [9]. In our simulation, we assume that when pfdba promoter is working, it will work as constitutive promoter,and the mathematical descriptions of the model are:
The model consists of basal expression(α0Y),protein synthesis(αC,αY),repressor binding(βC),protein decay(γC,γY) and repressor cooperativity(ηC) for CI(C) and keratinase(Y).Following figure 1 shows the result of simulation.

2. Deterministic modeling of whole whitening circuit
To introduce our three mathematical models, we first indicate and compare the difference between each model constructing a more clearly outline.
Model 3 separates the original model using αoc,αc(αoc is the steady state; αc is the maximum transcription rate) to express the linear part and non-linear part of the system.   Model 1 isolate the RBS strength, activator and repressor from the original equation. The whole function is the multiplication of RBS strength, activator and repressor. The RBS strength here is equivalent to the maximum transcription rate.
