IGEM_Taida strives for elevating awareness on issues regarding synthetic biology.
We provide
student community, biotech companies and social media  information about the latest in the research area of synthetic biology to help these communities make informed and fact-based opinions.
We strengthen
the bridge between communities and their knowledge of synthetic biology while eliminating misconceptions regarding synthetic biology.
Public Outreach
New generations
iGEM leads the way with this conviction: allowing for undergraduate students to work in groups on projects that have potentially applications that will benefit the lives of people everywhere.
Besides colleges, we also conduct vigorous propaganda in high school. We had held campuses for 3 high schools in Taipei for one reason: we want to inspire people.
We also met up with Taipei American School, the competitor in 2013 Igem High School. During gathering, we shared our ideas and viewpoints to each project and had great time.

Competition
In order to make our Igem PKEK gene circuit more practical, we combined commercial competition with our PKEK project. We wanted to use the synthetic biology to produce huge amounts of medical peptides, which have high value and can make contribution to people all over the world. Therefore, we participated the China Innovation & Entrepreneurship competition. Luckily we passed the preliminary round and semi-final round contests. In the competition, we delivered the precise synthetic biology concept to the audience and the judges. Let everyone knew how synthetic biology works.

Lecture/Course
To achieve this goal, various speeches and activities are held for the communities to understand the field of synthetic biology.
Flipped Classroom
iGEM is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition. Students have changes to design their own biological systems and operate them in living cells. This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method. Pro. Yen-Rong Chen, the leader of our lab, built up a brand-new education method in our school.
The course are named” Project Design and Practice of biochemistry”. Through numerous training, we have develop our capability from creativity, management practice, team building and independent thinking that we can hardly learn from general classes. Also, cooperation across business and academic was take into concerned.
Media and Publicans
Our members wrote special columns at blogs and Facebook fan page, and leading TNL (The News Lens) to notice our team. During interview, we talk our projects and ideas. To our happiness, we successfully attract the public and biotech companies. We believe that synthetic biology represents a convergence of advances in chemistry, biology, computer science, and many more. Experts in these fields should work together to create reusable, systematic methods for supreme boundary. The concept of synthetic biology should be deep planting in everyone’s heart. Here we list some journals that carried our articles:
-Connectome
-Taiwan Medical Students Research Communication
-Investigator
-The News Lens
Conference and Discussions
Conference
From multiple discussions and conference, we received different perspectives to our project and also, had chances to improve ourselves.
-2014 International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference, host by National Chiao-Tung University.
-China Medical University, Taiwan
Discussions
Through the course “Project Design and Practice of biochemistry”, we enjoy debating on our project to make it comprehensive.
We also seek ideas from different domain. Pro. Su Nan-Wei , the authority in lipid chemistry gave us several insights. Pro. Yang Chao-Hsun  and Jiang Hong-Ren  also inspire us a lot.
Social Justice
"Social justice" is generally used to refer to a set of institutions which will enable people to lead a fulfilling life and be active contributors to their community. IGEM competition is a great way to learn skills necessary to make a startup. While undertaking our project, we were trapped in the bottleneck - capital shortage. It is a general phenomenon in Taiwan, not only to students, but to all the scholarship. People only care about the interest of result, but ignore all the effort and resource it should pay during development.
We were motivated by a simple desire: the innovations in scientific research should be valued. We grasp every opportunities to express the idea, from contributions to ambushing outside the room of international conference room, we tried to raise the attention of audience to face this problem.
There has been some changes, but still there’s a long way to go. Positive feedbacks from audience gave us confidence to keep moving on.
