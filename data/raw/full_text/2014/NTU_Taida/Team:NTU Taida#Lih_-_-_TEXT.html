Establishment and History
Our vision is to advance medical health system and improve better living quality for all human.
Lihpao Life Science focuses on developing dendritic cell therapy, vaccine/gene therapy for cancer, immune reagents, protein medication, molecular genetic diagnosis through NGS (Next Generation Sequencing), and stem cell preservation and applications. To achieve this goal, we gathered and co-operated world-wide expertise on molecular biology and immunology. As to date, we have enormous improvements and encouraging results in above topics. Especially in immunological research, our dendritic cell therapy, cancer vaccine, and immune reagent hold exclusive patents that are recognized by Taiwan, USA, and Japan.
In 2002, Lihpao Life Science holds an official GLP (Good Laboratory Practice), approved by Mistry of Health and Welfare, for clinical trials on the HCC (Hepatocellular Carcinoma). By collaborating with Taipei Veterans General Hospital for HCC phase I/II clinical trial, we provide the data on the safety and efficiency of dendritic cell therapy on HCC.
Lihpao Life Science proudly presents Lactobacillus casei 889 (Lc889) as a food product for the purpose of improving all human’s health. This particular Lactobacillus is a patented probiotic that could not only modulate immune response, but also improve innate immunity. Lihpao Life Science takes the possibility of the probiotic to the next level: Lactobacillus Shuttle Vector. Our Lactobacillus shuttle vector could be used as DNA shuttle medication or vaccine, which could safely deliver the medication into human body through oral path and could greatly improve specificity on immune response.  In addition to the preservation of stem cell, Lihpao Life Science focused on the research and application of stem cell for the next generation. We collaborate with various medical organizations for more accurate and reliable outcomes on each research. By doing this, Lihpao Life Science hopes to become a world-leading biotechnology company.
Wu, Bao-Tian, chairman of LIH PAO Life Science, has devoted himself into promoting living standard in Taiwan, and contracted LIH PAO Life Science in2010. Through founding Cancer Genomics Laboratory and gene pool of Tumor, LIH PAO Life Science work hard seeking out treatment of many disease, especially cancer.
Believed in the concept that in 21 century, medical treatment should be able to be customized for maximum efficiency, LIH PAO Life Science also put emphasis on stem cell application and gene’s drug development.  For further details, please follow: www.llsc.com.tw
