mRNA extraction from Arabidopsis thaliana
Learn how to extract the plasmid.
Learn how to conduct the gel extraction and electrophoresis
Learn how to transform.
Learn how to do the gel extraction
Learn how to use the PCR Machine.
Design the primer for the FadL,R
6/25
RNA gel electrophoresis

6/30
mRNA extraction for the second time
Result: Failed (Smeared band indicated degradation of mRNA)
Design the primer for the FadL,R
Determine whether to use the elongated primer(primer which contains the first 20 mer of FadR,L coding sequence and plus the restriction site which contains the E,X,S,P.
After heavily discussion, we decided to use the elongated primer. Though there is a big chance of failure, but it’s easy to operate.
Visit the 2014 Igem website and learn the rules set by the Igem.
Learn the biobrick design.
JULY
7/1
mRNA extraction for the third time
Result: Failed (Smeared band indicated degradation of mRNA)
Use the primer we designed to get the FadR, L from E.coli.
Failed 4 times. But the fifth cloning experiment had a huge success.
Therefore, we have the Fad R/L, though they had already registered in the iGEM website(sample not in stock)
7/2
mRNA extraction for the fourth time
Result: Succeeded (Five Distinct bands indicate five chromosomes possessed by Arabidopsis thaliana)
Make cDNA from extracted mRNA using RNA dependent DNA reverse transcriptase (kit: Go script)
Primer design: CCD1、LOX1、HPL1
HPL1 has to be point mutated in order to become suitable for IGEM backbone pSB1C3
7/15
PCR(CCD1、LOX1、HPL1)
Result: Failed
Using the biobrick, and transformed the biobrick plasmid to our DH5-alpha E.coli.
1. Ribosomal binding site: RBS30.RB34
2. Promoter: J23100, J23101
3. Terminator: B0015, B0012
4. Plasmid backbone: Psb1A3, Psb1C3, Psb1K3
5. GFP: E0034, E0040
Extract the plasmid and make them into stocks.
Design the PKEK sequence, with whole genome synthesis (But later this idea was disapproved by the professor an use the primer synthesis method)
Make discussion with dry lab member to determine which strategy should use for modeling our pathway. Later we all agree to use the GFP assay.
7/17
PCR(CCD1、LOX1、HPL1)
Gradient: 50°C~60°C
Result: Failed (Probably there are some problem with our cDNA)
Started to assemble the gene circuit.
1. The beginning of every circuit is to cut the RBS 30/34 with restriction enzymes SpeI & PstI. And the FadR/L is cut with XbaI and PstI restriction enzymes.
2. After digestion for four hours, we conducted the electrophoresis and gel extraction for our target DNA sequences.
3. We ligated the RBS30/34 and FadR/L with ligase.(ligation high2.0)
Overnight.
4. Transformed the overnight plasmid to the DH5alpha competent cell.
5. Colony PCR to make sure whether we had insert the right gene into our competent cells.
7/18
Transformation of the following biobrick parts:
B0033 (RBS, weak),  C0051 (CI),  R0051 (pCI),  B0015 (terminator)
All of them using CP plate.
Results: R0051 (pCI) failed.
7/19
Bacterial culture: B0033 (RBS, weak),  C0051 (CI),  B0015 (terminator)
Redo R0051 (pCI) transformation =>failed again
Possible reason: We mistakenly took the plasmid backbone of R0051 as pSB1C3, which is actually pSB1A2, and therefore used the wrong antibiotics. On the next day, we used Amp+ plate, add more SOB in recovery, use another competent cell(XBL-blue), and did it again.
mRNA extraction for the fifth time
Result: Failed (Smeared band indicated degradation of mRNA)
mRNA extraction for the sixth time
Result: Succeeded (Five Distinct bands indicate five chromosomes possessed by Arabidopsis thaliana)

7/20

Gradient: 50°C~60°C

Then use DNA electrophoresis to confirm that all of them are correct.

Gel extraction and purification (one of HPL1’s point-mutated parts)
7/22
Plasmid extraction of pCI and confirmation, using EcoRI digestion and DNA electrophoresis. The DNA concentration was too low that band was invisible on the agarose gel.
PCR(LOX1、HPL1)
Gradient: 50°C~60°C
Result: Failed with both LOX1 and HPL1
Primer design: (FAD6、HPL1 redesign)
7/23
Redo bacterial culture and plasmid extraction of pCI. Failed again.
Possible reason: We didn’t wait for a few minutes for MP2 to react, so the cell lysis step wasn’t complete.
Another project is to make the GFP assay. So we decided to ligate the RBS 34/30 with GFP. The method are identical to the Fad R/L gene circuits.
For now we have:
1. RBS30 – FadR
2. RBS30 – FadL
3. RBS34 – FadR
4. RBS34 – FadL
5. RBS34 – GFP
6. RBS30 – GFP

7/29
plasmid extraction of pCI succeeded, but DNA electrophoresis failed, there was no band near 2.1k. Reason unknown.
Extract whole genome from Bacillus licheniformis. Failed.
Possible reason:
1. Bacillus licheniformis grows slower than E. coli. We didn’t give it enough time to grow.
2. Bacillus licheniformis is gram+, its thick cell wall may be harder to lyse.=> use another protocol.
PCR(LOX1、HPL1’s another part)
Gradient: 50°C~60°C
Result: Failed with both LOX1 and HPL1
7/30
Redo bacterial culture of Bacillus licheniformis =>The bacteria didn’t grow.
Subculture of Bacillus licheniformis plate. =>success
Redo pCI DNA electrophoresis. There was an unclear band near 2.1k.
PCR(FAD6)
Gradient: 50°C~60°C
Result: Succeeded with FAD6 at annealing temperature of 58°C
Gel extraction and purification (FAD6)
7/31
Redo bacterial culture of Bacillus licheniformis =>The medium dried out because the cap didn’t fit.
Another project is to make the GFP assay. So we decided to ligate the RBS 34/30 with GFP. The method are identical to the Fad R/L gene circuits.
For now we have:
1. RBS30 – FadR
2. RBS30 – FadL
3. RBS34 – FadR
4. RBS34 – FadL
5. RBS34 – GFP
6. RBS30 – GFP
And we started to ligate the promoter part to the existing gene circuits.
Prepare the presentation and PPT for the 2014 Asia Igem conference.
The laboratory was polluted by a strange strain of E.coli, and it seems like this polluted bacteria also contained the RFP, which appears in our every electrophoresis result. But this strange phenomenon suddenly seized in the beginning of August
We decided to make our PKEK gene circuits by primer-annealing methods. And we ordered the primers and materials in the late July.
AUGUST
Attending the Igem Asia conference, exchanged our thought of signal sequence and PKEK. We got lots of inspiration and suggestion, which influenced our latter experiment methods and design.
We decided to bring our PKEK circuit in to commercial design. By fusion our PKEK circuits to the his-tag, we can order our E.coli to produce huge amounts of PKEK, and use the his-tag to catch our PKEK product. (This part is still under conistruction)
In order to make our Igem PKEK gene circuit more practical, we combined commercial competition with our PKEK project. We wanted to use the synthetic biology to produce huge amounts of medical peptides, which have high value and can make contribution to people all over the world. Therefore, we participated the China Innovation & Entrepreneurship competition. Luckily we passed the preliminary round and semi-final round contests. In the competition, we delivered the precise synthetic biology concept to the audience and the judges. Let everyone knew how synthetic biology works.

2. Ligation the two parts overnights.
3. Transformation(overnight)
4. Colony PCR.
8/4
Ligation preparation: digestion and purification of CI and pCI =>pCI failed
8/5
Redo whole genome extract from Bacillus licheniformis =>failed
Redo digestion and purification of pCI =>failed again.
Possible reason:
1. After one week, the high-concentration pCI has degraded =>Redo measuring DNA concentration, but it didn’t decrease very much.
2. The high absorption at 260nm is actually contributed by RNA, not pCI. =>Add RNase, incubate for 15 minutes and measure again, but it didn’t decrease.
3. The high absorption at 260nm is actually contributed by other DNA, not pCI=>But there was no other band or even smear on the agarose gel.
We couldn’t think of other possible reason, so we decided to request a new one.
8/6

Redo whole genome extract from Bacillus licheniformis =>low but acceptable concentration.

At that time, we assumed that we had assemble some gene circuits.
Some of them are successfully assembled, but others may be failure.
1. J23100 - RBS30 – FadR
2. J23100 - RBS30 – FadL
3. J23100 - RBS34 – FadR
4. J23100 - RBS34 – FadL
5. J23100 - RBS34 – GFP
6. J23100 - RBS30 – GFP
P.S：There arose a big problem! The promoter J23100 can’t assemble to our previous gene circuits, although we tried many times. We doubt that maybe the J23100in the stock is out of work. We failed many times, finally we decided to change the J23100 into J23119, hope this will work.
