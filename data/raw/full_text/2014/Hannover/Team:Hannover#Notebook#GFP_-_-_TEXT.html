Notebook / Locate GFP and the CBD
Here we list all the steps that were required to locate the cellulose binding domain (CBD) within the cell using GFP as a marker.
ONC = overnight culture ; CBD = Cellulose binding domain ; IPG = Institute for plant genetics ; OD = optical density ;  PCR = Polymerase chain reaction ;  RT = room temperature ; T4MBP = Top 4 metal binding protein ; EMP = Exponential Megapriming PCR ; GFP = Green fluorescent protein

colony-PCR
although colony-PCR (F1+R1) confirmed insertion of GFP: another primer set (1101 and 625, IPG) targeting the backbone of pMA did not bind in the colony, but showed an unexpected amplificate length of ~1200 bp in the negative control (expected for pMA: ~1600 bp)
