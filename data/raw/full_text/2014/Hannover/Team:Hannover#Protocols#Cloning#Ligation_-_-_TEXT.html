Protocols / Ligation
After restriction enzyme cleavage, compatible ends of two fragments can hybridize, but are not stable due to their missing phosphodiester bonds. To fix those nicks in the double-stranded DNA, a ligase from T4 phages (Thermo Scientific) was utilized. The ligation reaction mix is shown in the following table.
Table 1: Reaction Mixes and Temperature Programs for the Ligation.
