Taking part in the iGEM competition - behind the scenes
Besides all the formalities and scientific work, you will get an impression of how we managed to organize all issues concerning iGEM. For that you can find notepads beginning from team formation, over finances and finally attending the Giant Jamboree.
2013 Nov
- Foundation of the first iGEM Team from Hannover.
- Presentations and development of topics begin.
Dec
- In December, a lot of research work was done.
2014 Jan
- Writing a draft paper about iGEM and synthetic biology gives possible sponsors an impression of our work.
- From January on the whole team met once weekly, whereas the smaller teams of specialists organized their meetings in a flexible way.
Feb
- Our topic is finally chosen. We decided to take up the fight against heavy metals pollution.
- For the design of our construct we used bioinformatics to increase its functionality.
- Completion of our draft paper with information about our topic.
- Visiting the local sewage plant.
Mar
- We officially signed up for iGEM competition 2014!
- Our homepage and our facebook page are online.
Apr
-In April, a lot of work in the fields of finances and sponsoring was done. - The future lab work was planned and protocols were written.
May
- Synthesis of our self-designed T4MBP is submitted.
- Andreas and Fabian took part in the iGEM meeting 2014 in Munich.
- The iGEM team Braunschweig visited us for a barbecue.
June
- Andreas presented our topic at the Science Slam in Hanover.
- We started visiting schools to conduct presentations about synthetic biology and how we use it to achieve our goal.
- Our synthesised construct of the T4MBP arrived in our lab. Besides some little lab tasks that have already been prepared, the real lab work with our centerpiece (T4MBP) could start.
July
- As all team members had to write exams in July, the work for our iGEM project was reduced to the lab work.
Aug
- We invited the newspaper "Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung" to achieve publicity.
- We built up an information desk in the inner-city of Hanover to give passers-by an understanding of synthetic biology by demonstrating a DNA isolation with simple housewares, playing a memory quiz and showing in vitro cultures.
- We booked six flights and an apartment for our stay in Boston.
- Anke, Fabian and Andreas visited the iGEM team Bielefeld to learn how to build up the wiki.
Sep
- Creating our own Wiki.
Oct
- In October, we finished our lab work and so everyone wrote texts and protocols for our Wiki.
Nov
- Taking part in the Giant Jamboree and gathering precious experience
Presentations and ideas concerning potential topics can be collected in a dokuwiki . This might also be useful for the organization of your project.
To handle the huge amount of work, you should split up to smaller teams of specialists.
Tasks which should be assigned to the team members are:
- Finances
- Sponsoring
- Safety issues
- Human practice
-overview of formalities and time.
The whole team should meet every week to exchange news of the smaller teams of specialists.
Here you can find useful information: Synbioreview and lecture videos.
On this website iGEM gathered a lot of helpful advices.
Before sponsorship money can be raised, you need a banking account at your university. Arrange enough time for bureaucracy procedures!
Contracts for different types of sponsoring and donations have to be prepared.
As the bureaucracy is elaborate (we had 5 different banking accounts for different types of money) the support of an office assistant is essential.
As creating an own wiki isn't as easy as it may look like at first glance, you should start working on it a least one or two months before the wiki is frozen. Also you should look out for a person or another iGEM team that introduces you to html code.
Flights should be booked in time since the prices will raise from August on. If you don't have enough money, book the number of flights that you are able to pay. Later, if you might have received more money, you can book flights for more team members. Be aware that flight tickets have to be personalized.
Keep also in mind that you need a valid pass port. In Germany the processing time may take up to 4 weeks.
The ESTA has to be requensted 72 hours before your flight.
