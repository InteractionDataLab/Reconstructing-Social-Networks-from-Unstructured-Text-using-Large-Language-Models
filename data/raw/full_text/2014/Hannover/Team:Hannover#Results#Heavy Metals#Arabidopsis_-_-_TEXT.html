Results / Heavy metals / Arabidopsis thaliana T4MBP
Labwork
Transformation of A. thaliana with our T4MBP:
Exchange the original promoter enTCUP2 of the binary vector pORE_E3 (AY562536.1) into a 2x35S promoter using resctriction site based cloning .
We integrated our T4MBP in our modified pORE_E3_2x35S.
Application of our floral dip method.
After 6 weeks, we harvested transgenic seeds from A. thaliana and plated these seeds on selection MSO-media.
At last we potted transformed plants.
Results
The exchange of the promoter was checked by sequencing. We achieved to regenerate young A. thaliana after the transformation with our T4MBP. A PCR and an immunoblot would indicate, if the tested plants were positive or negative for our T4MBP. To receive a stabile F2 generation, seeds of transformed plants would have to be harvested and grown. As a next step of this test series, the plants would have been transfered on medium with heavy metals. In a following analysis it would be detected if these plants bind the heavy metal zinc, copper, cadmium and/or arsenic.

Below in figures 2 and 3 you can see the original vector pORE_E3 with an enTCUP2 promoter. For a better expression of our T4MBP protein we exchanged the enTCUP2 with the 2x35S promoter. Each step of this procedure is visualized in this history . Furthermore this history includes the insertion of our T4MBP (there termed CDS for coding sequence).
