Human Practice / Schools
In the school biotechnology is already a big topic. Students are shown the basics of the theory behind it. "Plant Against" is a perfect example of how this theory together with some creativity can lead to wonderful projects. Synthetic biology has great potential. By learning about this project and the iGEM competition, the students might get interested in participating in a related field of study, or even the competition itself.
We, the iGEM Team Hannover held a presentation about biotechnology and the iGEM competition. In addition to present our project "Plant-Against" we paid special attention to the things that happened "beyond the lab". Important aspects like finding sponsors, communicating with other teams around the world, and building up this special kind of team spirit. Students of the Erich Kästner High School, Laatzen, the Waldorf School, Hannover Maschsee and the High School, Sarstedt were a very interested audience. In the discussion afterwards, which was the most interesting part for us, we not only answered questions about our iGEM project, but also talked about future plans of the students and the possibility of studying biotechnology.
We would also like to say “Thank you” to the responsible teachers again.
During your presentation you should adjust your talk to your audience. Keep it simple and interesting! ;)
Introducing your university and your course of studies might attract the attention of these potential future students.
