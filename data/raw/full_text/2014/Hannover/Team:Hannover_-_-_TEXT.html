From 2014.igem.org
Welcome to iGEM Team Hannover´s Wiki
About this Wiki!
Being the first iGEM Team from Hanover, Germany, we decided to make our Wiki as informative as possible for new and successor teams. For that reason, we introduce the so-called "tip-boxes" on the right side of the page. They provide helpful comments and information for prospective teams.
We tried to interlink the content as good as possible, embed our results into the appropriate context and make the site accessible for users of tablets and smartphones who might have a hard time triggering usual mouse-over menus.
As a first hint: click on the pictures!
