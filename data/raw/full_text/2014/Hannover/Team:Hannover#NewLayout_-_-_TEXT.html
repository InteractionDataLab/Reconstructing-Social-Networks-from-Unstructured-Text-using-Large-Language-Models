Welcome to iGEM Team Hanover´s website!
Our LUH-Team consists of eleven motivated young under- and graduate-students coming from “Life Science” and “Plant Biosience Technology” studies. They get supported by their supervisors Prof. Dr. Peterhänsel (Institute of Botany) and Dr. Reinard (Institute for Plant Genetics) as well as Patrick Reinke, a graduate student, who already has iGEM experience.
To strengthen our University´s  reputation as an onward and  innovative institution, is one goal of us. Therefore we do our best to create a stable infrastructure for our successors. More information are availabe here: Faculty for Natural Sciences Hannover .
Short Project Description
Our goal is to produce a Top4 Metal Binding Protein (T4-MBP) which attaches itself to the cellulose of  plants and binds four heavy metals of global relevance. We intend to use naturally occurring metallothioneins - proteins whose specific amino acid sequences alone make them able to form complexes with heavy metals.
We are planing to use our protein in terrestrial (Arabidopsis thaliana) as well as aquatic plants (Wolffia). Our genetic construct is ultimately to be brought into the target organism with the aid of a transformation by Rhizobium radiobacter (formerly Agrobacterium tumefaciens). More information are availabe under: Project

Wolffia is really a damn cool plant. Doubling Biomass every few days ..
Don't you ever forget your infrastructure !
