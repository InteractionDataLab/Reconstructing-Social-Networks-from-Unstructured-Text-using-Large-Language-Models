Team:Hannover/Background Plant Vector
From 2014.igem.org
Background / Plant vector
For our labwork we need a vector, which is proven to work while transferred into tobacco and Arabidopsis plants. Unfortunately iGEM does not provide a sequenced and saved one. Therefore we decided to establish such a vector in a sub-project.
We used the vector pORE_E3 (AY562536.1) and tried to exchange the original enTCUP2 promoter into a 2x35s promoter because it was better for our operations with tobacco and Arabidopsis plants. Additionally we wanted to change the origin MCS into an iGEM MCS – Berkeley RFC[21] assembly standard. RFC[21] allows cloning in frame as well as RFC[12] . RFC[21] has an decisive advantage over RCF[12]: the prefix of RFC[21] consists of only two restriction sites and has no GC-rich sequence of the NotI-restriction-site (RFC[12] has a NotI-site). A missing NotI-site is better if you use a 5`UTR and in general, GC-rich sequences are more easily deformable than AT-rich sequences. Our attempt was to use one pair of primers, which should hybridize in a water bath and thus build an insert, containing the MCS of RFC[21] and overhangs for cloning into pORE_E3.
Besides we wanted to remove the restriction sites for XhoI and BglII from pORE_E3 because these shall not occur in iGEM’s vectors. With our modified pORE_E3_2x35s vector we wanted to provide iGEM a new standard for working with and in plants.
You can find all forbidden restriction sites here
An alternative method is to synthesize the insert, cut it with restriction enzymes and then clone it into the vector.
