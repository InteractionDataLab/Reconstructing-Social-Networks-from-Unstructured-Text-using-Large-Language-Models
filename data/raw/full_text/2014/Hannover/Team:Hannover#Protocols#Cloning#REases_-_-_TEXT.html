Protocols / Restriction Enzyme Cleavage (Digest)
Transfer of nucleic acids was enabled by cutting sequences with restriction endonucleases. The enzymes used here identify their recognition site, cut within it, and leave behind single-stranded overhangs (sticky ends). In case no recognition site is present, attachment can be achieved by adding them to the 5´ end of PCR´s oligonucleotides. To have orientated genetic recombination, two endonucleases generating different overhangs were chosen for each cloning step. The reaction mix used here is shown in the following table.
