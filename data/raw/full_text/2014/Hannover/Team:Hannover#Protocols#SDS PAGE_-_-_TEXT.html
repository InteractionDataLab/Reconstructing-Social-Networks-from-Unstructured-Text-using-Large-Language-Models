Protocols / SDS-PAGE
Material:
12 % Running gel
2.1 ml  H2O,
2.5 ml  acrylamide 4K 29:1 mix  (40 %),
1.6 ml 1.5 M Tris-HCl; pH 8.8,
62.5 μl 10 % SDS,
62.5 μl 10 % APS,
2.5 μl TEMED
12 % Stacking gel
2.7 ml   H2O,
680 μl  acrylamide 4K  29:1 mix  (40 %),
540 μl 1 M Tris-HCl; pH 6.8,
40 μl 10 % SDS,
30 μl 10 % APS,
8 μl TEMED
Electrophoresis system
Running buffer
250 mM Tris-HCl; pH 8.3,
1.92 mM glycine,
0.1 % (v/v) SDS
Protocol
The SDS polyacrylamide gels are prepared in the so-called PerfectBlue™ Twin Double Gel System (PEQLAB Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen). After ensuring that the equipment is waterproof, the 12 % running gel is mixed and filled into the chamber. Pipetting 1 ml of H2O on top of the running gel, prevents coves between the entire running and stacking gel. The comb is stuck into the chamber to maintain the right gel depth. After polymerization, the remaining H2O is removed and the 12 % stacking gel (Table 1) is filled on top. To create sample pockets a comb is inserted centrally. If the stacking gel is also polymerized, 1 x running buffer (Table 1)is used to run the Double Gel System via the SDS gel. After loading the generated pockets with the samples, the gel is run for 1:10 to 1:20 h at 150 V.
Polyacrylamide is a strong toxic agent for neurons. Be careful please!
