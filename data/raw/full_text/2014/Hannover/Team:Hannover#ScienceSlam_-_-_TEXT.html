Team:Hannover/ScienceSlam
From 2014.igem.org
Human Practice / Science Slam
Traces of heavy metals are found within smartphones, in tires and many other objects which are in wide use. But in several areas like Bangladesh and China, the tolerated concentration of those metals are exceeding the safety thresholds significantly. We illustrated how heavy metals infiltrate our ecosystem and some concepts for biotechnology based approaches to solve that problem.
On the Indo German Science Slam on June 25 in Hannover, our team member Andreas turned out to be a real comedian! To simplify the synthetic biology and function of the DNA something fell back not only to the boring "Lego principle”. No, Andreas reached into the bag of tricks of dirty, black German humor to knock the audience's socks off. Everyone knows the Germans are renowned for their sense of humor and even world famous!
Against four other German and five Indian comedy students, Andreas had to compete as deputy to the iGEM team Hannover. Engineering, mathematics, cars, environment and many more topics were represented this evening. Our idea of using plants to save our environment, was in this case not enough for first place in the Science Slam. But Andreas definitely won a place in the hearts of all viewers with his performance.
Humor is always individual. For a presentation entertaining as multiple humors as possible, meet with several team members and do a brainstorming session.
Invite as many friends as you can. The more supporters are present, the louder the clapping will be.
Especially focus on the pronounciation when you practise the talk. If the pronunciation is failed, the audience could miss your idea. Link your content to current happenings, experience showed that the audience likes that very much.
