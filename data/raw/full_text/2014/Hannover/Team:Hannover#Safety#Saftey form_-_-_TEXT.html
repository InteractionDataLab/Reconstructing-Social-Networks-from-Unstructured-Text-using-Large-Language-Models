Team:Hannover/Safety/Saftey form
From 2014.igem.org
Safety / Safety form
1. Your Training
a) Have your team members received any safety training yet?
Yes, we have already received safety training.
b) Please describe the things you learned (or will learn) in your safety training.
- general instructions how to work and behave in a lab
- rules to keep the lab clean (lab service)
- location of security-relevant objects such as eye showers, first aid kit etc.
- instructions on lab equipment such as centrifuges, heaters, fume hoods etc.
- use of dangerous substances
- record requirement for GMOs
- prohibition of unattended working: at least one advisor has to be present
- duty of notification on unusualness
- authority to give directives
- briefing of all women concerning possible dangers for expectant mothers
c) Please give a link to the laboratory safety training requirements of your institution (college,  university, community lab, etc). Or, if you cannot give a link, briefly describe the requirements.

2. Your local rules and regulations
a)  Who  is  responsible  for  biological  safety  at  your  institution?  (You  might  have  an  Institutional  Biosafety  Committee,  an  Office  of  Environmental  Health  and  Safety,  a  single  Biosafety  Officer,  or  some other arrangement.) Have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns  they  raised, and any changes you made in your project based on your discussion.
At  our  university,  there  is  Dr.  Petra  Bohmer-Brinks  as  the  superior  “representative  for  biological safety“. Furthermore one of our advisors, Dr. Thomas Reinard, and also Prof. Jutta Papenbrock are educated after the “genetic engineering act” § 15.
Our  advisors,  Dr.  Reinard  and  Prof.  Peterhänsel,  oversee  and  also  help  us  planning  our  lab  work.  Concerning  genetically-engineered  works  they  are  constrained  to  confer  with  Dr.  Petra  Bohmer- Brinks, who is in the end responsible by law.
Since  the  establishment  of  the  “International  Gene  Synthesis  Consortium  (IGSC)”  all  included companies examine DNA-syntheses for sequence-parts that could act as a danger for the public. In our case it was noted that one of our chosen domains derives from Clostridium. As a consequence  we got a warning from the synthesising company that an import of the construct into the USA might  break the laws. Because of that Dr. Bohmer-Brinks advised us to contact companies which do also  import biological material from the relevant lists (e.g. organisms being on the list of the “Australia  group”) into the USA.
As an alternative, the chosen domain has to be  exchanged by a pendant, whose origin cannot be  found on the mentioned lists.
b)  What  are  the  biosafety  guidelines  of  your  institution?  Please  give  a  link  to  these  guidelines,  or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.
Most  of  the  laws  that  we  take  as  guidelines  for  our  work  are  written  especially  for  Germany  and therefore  in  German. It  is  not  possible  to  translate  them  into  English  one-to-one.  So  we  briefly describe them here.
1. “Gentechnische-Sicherheitsverordnung (GenTSV)” (genetic engineering safety ordinance) Is  an  ordinance  on  the  security  levels  and  safety  measures  for  genetic  engineering  operations  in genetic engineering facilities (Genetic Engineering Safety Ordinance - GenTSV). It also describes how a disposal of GMOs has to be done.
2. “Technische  Regel  für  Biologische  Arbeitsstoffe  100  (TRBA100)”  (technical  rules  for  biological  agents).
“The Technical Rules for Biological Agents (TRBA) reflect the state of requirements in terms of safety,  occupational  health,  hygiene  and  work  science  with  respect  to  activities  involving  the  handling  of  biological  agents.  They  are  drawn  up  by  the  Ausschuss  für  Biologische  Arbeitsstoffe  (ABAS)  -  Committee for Biological Agents - and adapted by the Committee in accordance with developments.” link
c) In your country, what are the regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories? Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.
1. Gentechnikgesetz (GenTG)(genetic engineering act)
„In Germany, genetic engineering is stipulated in the Genetic Engineering Act It aims both to protect against  potential  risks  arising  from  the  application  of  genetic  engineering  as  well  as  to  facilitate exploitation  of  and  exploration  into  genetic  engineering.. Essentially,  it  regulates  activities  of development and application of genetically modified organisms, in laboratories for example, and also governs deliberate releases of genetically modified organisms into the environment.“ link
2. Biostoffverordnung (BioStoffV)  §1 loosly translated:  (1) The “Biostoffverordnung” is applied for work with biological working material. It regulates actions  to protect the safety and health of employees. Furthermore, it regulates actions to protect people who are not directly affected by the biologic material.  (2) The BioStoffV is also valid for work being subject to the Gentechnikrecht (genetic technology law),  if there are no equal or stronger regulations on protection of the employees. link
3. Allgemeine Stellungnahmen der ZKBS (general recommendations of the ZKBS -Central Committee  on Biological Safety) link
