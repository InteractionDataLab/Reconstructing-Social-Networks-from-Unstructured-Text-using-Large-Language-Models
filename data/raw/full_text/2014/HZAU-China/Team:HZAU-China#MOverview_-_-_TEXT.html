Overview
Our project aims to engineer cells that can process information to adapt to the environment as we expected, so we need to yield quantitative predictions of gene behaviors. Mathematic model becomes a powerful tool here. It not only helps us predict and analyze the phenomena, but also contributes to the design of genetic circuits. Our models can be divided into several parts. Firstly, we will introduce the biological processes in our design and translate them into mathematical language. Then we will perform some comparisons to explain why we designed circuits this way. Next, we will present the simulation results and experiment evidences from wet lab. Parameter analysis will also be made here. Finally, we will talk about the design principle of the rewirable circuit using ODE sets with matrices. We hope that other researchers can get insight from the mathematic model and make the rewirable circuit widely used.
