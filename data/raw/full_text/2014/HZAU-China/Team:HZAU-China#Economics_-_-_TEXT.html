Economics
Because our project is only a tentative step forward in synthetic biology, we refrained from making concrete policy advices when much is still in the dark. So, in preparation of future market possibilities, we analyzed the market failure instances of GMO using game theory from economics as a reference for synthetic biology. However, what started out as a possible preparation for future policy making ended up throwing itself over when we carefully examined the underlying assumptions and found the unwarranted ground these policies might be built on.
Intellectual Property Law
We design a rewirable circuit in our project, which means that cell may automatically make variations and produce new significative gene. So the belonging of the gene's intellectual property right would be controversial.
