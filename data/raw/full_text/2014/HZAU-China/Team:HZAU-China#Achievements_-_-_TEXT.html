Judgement
We apply for a Gold Medal, Best Information Processing Project, Best Model, Best Policy &Practices Project.
As for the Gold Medal
We have met these requirements below:
1. Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree
2. Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2014 Judging form.
3. Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
4. Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
5. We have finished the description of each project, clearly attributed work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. You can see it in our attribution & acknowledgement .
6. We have documented and submitted the 14 parts to the iGEM Registry.
7. We experimentally validated that our two devices of input module ( BBa_K1368010 , BBa_K1368011 , BBa_K1368012 ) work as expected.
8. We have documented the characterization of those parts in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
9. We have submitted those new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry.
10. We improved the characterization of three existing BioBrick Parts. They are BBa_P0440 , BBa_P0451 , BBa_K537020 , BBa_J01008 and BBa_J01010 .
11. We helped the HUST-China with their promoter sequencing and test. Also they helped us build a part of the oscillator.
12. Beyond the lab work, we also did a lots of interesting things. You can see them in the outreach . We had collaboration with other teams, spread iGEM to the public and social media. And we also paid an attention to the safety. Specially, we held the CCiC meetup in Wuhan in this summer with 16 teams joined. Also we described and evaluated our project from the viewpoints of humanities, aesthetics, economics and law.
As for Best Information Processing Project:
Conventional engineered circuits in cells have only a simple regulatory network to process information. Once the environment changed, the approach to handle the information might be invalid. We adopted an elegant means of systems integration to make the cells have adaptability and work well in complex environments. Our engineered cells can process information according to the environment based on rewirable circuits; meanwhile our design overcame some common challenges in Synthetic Biology like host overload and crosstalk.
As for Best Model:
Different from most modeling work in iGEM, we first described the biological processes related to our project rather than list the equations used before directly. In this way, we made sense of the necessary preconditions we needed and it became easier to perform stochastic simulation. Before simulation, we incorporated useful information from wet lab to adjust some parameters and analyzed how some promoter properties would influence our devices. We revealed that the systems behaviors in the repressilator were closely related to the absolute promoter strength of the weakest promoter among the three genes. Many modeling approaches, including deterministic and stochastic simulations, phase analysis, parameter scanning, theoretical inference, were presented in our modeling part. Moreover, we introduced a novel design principle to help other researchers to finish their custom designs.
As for Best Policy & Practices Project：
1. Enhanced the iGEM community by initiating an iGEM consortium in central China, held a nation-wide meetup, and collaborated with many other iGEM teams in various forms;
2. Increased public awareness by online video, weekly campus seminars and youth educating;
3. Designed the first ethical-analyzing paradigm in iGEM to help future iGEMers open up thinking;
4. Rediscovered various aspects of iGEM with Runic symbol system;
5. Analyzed the behaviours of stakeholders with economics theory and law for policy reference.
