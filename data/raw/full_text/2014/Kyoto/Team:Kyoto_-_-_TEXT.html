Project Overview
If we are able to move E. coli to the proper places, the achievements of synthetic biology will be more useful. For example, bioremediation, drug delivery, making E. coli pellet without centrifuge, etc. In order to realize this dream, we focused on the magnetosome: a magnetic organelle of magnetotactic bacteria. It consists of a lipid bilayer and a  magnet. E. coli with magnetosome will be moved by magnetism. To realize this amazing E. coli, we started from making the magnetosome. Finally, we detected magnetosome-like vesicles in our transformants!

Project Overview
Generating cloud. This is our project aim. You might think we are dreaming, but, we found a clue in some scientists' words. In wetlands or sea, specific marine bacteria and coral produce dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which becomes a Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN), we thought we could produce cloud by creating E. coli which synthesizes DMS. To realize this, we consist a biosynthetic pathway of DMS in E. coli by introducing genes from Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Ruegeria pomeroyi. We use DMS detecting tube and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to confirm the function. Don't you think it is fantastic if the small organism, E. coli, creates something big, cloud? And this project may have the possibility to solve environmental problems.
