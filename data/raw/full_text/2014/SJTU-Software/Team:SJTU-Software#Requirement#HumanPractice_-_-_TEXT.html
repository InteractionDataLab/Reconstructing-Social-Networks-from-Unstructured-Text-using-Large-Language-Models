Attend 2nd IGEM Conference in NCTU
Time: 8.3~8.6
We are very happy that we can attend this conference, we learn from each other, got exercise and visit many scenic spots at Taiwan. The first thing I want to mention  is that it gives us a state to change our ideas, discuss with other people, so we can realize the disadvantages and inconvenience of our software. We think people's  opinions are most important for our software team, and we will try our best to make our software suitful for most users. Besides that, we also make many friends, we even play cards until 5 o'clock in the morning, pretty enjoy!
