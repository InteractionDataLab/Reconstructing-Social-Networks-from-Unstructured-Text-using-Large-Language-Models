Assessment Model
An assessment model is optimized to judge the quality of biobricks. With a default score given to each biobrick respectively, biobricks that are related to the input keyword in the “Easy BBK” search engine can be listed in descending order of scores although users can define their own sorting order. If sorted by default scores, users can always get biobricks with high quality. Our assessment model considered 4 general properties, namely status, reliability, feedback and publication, based on 12 attributes of a biobrick. Weights of the attributes in the general properties are already optimized and fixed; weights of the 4 general properties can be adjusted by users although default weights of the properties are optimized already and recommended to users.
Evaluation criteria
Based on the description on the website of Registry of Standard Biological Parts and advice collected from our instructor, 13 attributes of biobricks are picked out as evaluation criteria in the assessment model.
Considering different aspects users frequently takes into account when choosing a biobrick, we deliberately divided these attributes into 4 properties, which are listed in Table 1.
Property
Description
Status
Will I get this official part?
This property measures the availability of the part.
Reliability
Will this part work?
This property measures the working quality of the part.
Feedback
What is the review of previous teams or experimenters for this part?
This property collects the feedbacks of previous workers on the part.
Publication
How many publications are related to this part?
This property contains the related results on Google Scholar.
Table 1 The four properties in the assessment model
More detailed description of the attributes in the properties is demonstrated in Table 2.
Property

Description
Status
Part Status
The status of a part based on the completeness of its documentation and characterization.
DNA Status
States the DNA status of your part: Deleted, Planning, Sent, Available, etc. These statuses are generated by the Registry, so the user cannot edit them.
Whether or not Deleted
Whether the part is deleted or not.
Confirmed Times
Times of the sequence of the part being confirmed. Part samples are sequenced using the VF2 and VR primer sites on their plasmid backbones. Sequence results are then uploaded and compared to their target sequence (part's documented sequence) through Registry software.
Length of Documentation
Length of documentation for the part on Registry
Reliability
Part Results
The experience status for a part, as documented by the part authors. However, the part's experience is not a validation of the part by iGEM HQ.
Star Rating
Stars given by Registry
Group Favorite
Whether the part is a favorite of one team/group.
Feedback
Used Times
The number of times the part has been specified in composite parts in the Registry.
Average Rating
The average rating given for this part by other users.

Table 2 Detailed attributes in the assessment model
Scores given to the values in each criterion
There are two types of values in all the criteria: categorical variables (such as part status, part results, etc) and continuous variables (such as used times, average stars, etc).
For categorical variables, we give reasonable scores to different values in each criterion based on the researchers' experience and description of the values.
For continuous variables, we normalize the values in those criteria using the following formula, so that all the continuous variables range from 0 to 1 like categorical variables:
where x is an original value, x' is the normalized value.  The scores given to different values in all the attributes is presented in Table 3.

Table 3 Different scores given to the different values in all the criteria
Weights given to each criterion
50 biobricks were picked out as positive samples in Table 4. The weight of each criterion are then trained and adjusted to make the biobricks in the positive samples ranking the highest in the final scores.

These two parts are not outstanding in any attribute, however, they are better than most of the other parts in all of attributes.
BBa_R0040
BBa_R0010
Promoter
These two parts are used most frequently among promoters and they get good feedbacks from users.
Table 4 Part of the positive samples in our assessment model
The weights of the criteria in each property are fixed and cannot be adjusted by users. In “Easy BBK”, users could adjust the weight of the 4 properties - Status, Reliability, Feedback, Publication - in our assessment model although optimized weights and default scores have already given to the biobricks in the assessment model. The optimized weights are presented in Table 5.

Obviously, the two biobricks are the same in many attributes, and based on the overall information, we can generally conclude that the two parts are both of good quality.
However, when it comes to the number of used times, commented times, and number of results on Google scholar, it is suggested that BBa_B0031 is less popular and has less number of studies than BBa_B0034. What’s more, on Registry, the definition of efficiency of BBa_B0034 is 1.0, which is much higher than 0.07 of BBa_B0031. This is also literally confirmed by their short description.
The conclusion above and our user studies have confirmed that the quality of biobricks is in accordance with the scores in our assessment model.
