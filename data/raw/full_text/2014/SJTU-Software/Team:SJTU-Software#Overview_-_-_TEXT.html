EASY BBK:
An EASY Biobrick Blueprint's pacKage
We have constructed an Easy Biobrick Blueprint’s pacKage (EASY BBK) to assist users to search biobricks of good quality, compare the quality of biobricks, present bio-systems with standardized icons and upload biobricks to Registry or Easy BBK database.
Search
This function enables users to search by keywords or by sequence against our database. Advanced search mode is also provided to refine or sort the search results. In default mode, search results are sorted by a score given by our assessment model.
The searching engine is based on a database converted from the iGEM Registry (Up to 2014 August). More details on database: https://2014.igem.org/Team:SJTU-Software/Database .
Compare
Multiple biobricks can be added from search engine and then compared. You can search and get multiple (up to three) biobricks, and compare them side by side.
Present
In this function, a standardized picture of a biosystem could be plotted with standardized biobrick icons according to the iGEM Registry. The result can be exported, which could be used for the presentation in the publication, presentation or later design. Additionally, with presented biobricks connected with database, the upload form could be directly filled out in "upload".
Upload
Here, users could not only upload their biobricks to our database, but also submit their form filled out in our software to the Registry to upload their self-created biobricks.
