User Study
Goal
User studies are carried out to make our software “Easy BBK” to be more user-friendly. Based on the problems exposed in the test process of different users and their feedbacks, our developers can track the bugs and add new functions in the development of software.
Users
9 members from SJTU-bioX-Shanghai and some members from SUSTC-Shenzhen were invited to use our software. All of their operations are recorded in video and researched later to figure out problems or highlights in our software.
Highlights and problems fixed
Since we have focused mainly on the problems in our software during those studies, highlights are briefly recorded here.
• The search result offered by the search engine are quite satisfying
• Novelty of "Present"
Most problems identified during user studies were solved before wiki freezes; however, there remains some problems unsolved. Those problems which are not solved now are to be solved later, and we will continue conducting user studies to refine our software.
Problems solved by October 17th
Problem
Solution
Solved date
User doesn’t know detail information of a biobrick could be displayed
Distinguish the color of part name from other information
10.12
Spelling errors exist in some words on the interface
Make corrections on these mistakes

The detail page was not refreshed timely when user clicked another part name to view the detail of this part
Revise the source code to make the detail page refresh timely

A dialog box asking user whether to save the half-drawn bio-system would pop up when user click the "create a new file" button
10.12
User didn’t know what to do with the "compare" function
Add a hint on the interface to guide the user

Change the icon from "Blast" to "Blastn"
10.15
Icon positions of  "search by keyword" and "search by sequence" were too close to mislead user that they have a single function
