Acknowledgement
As the first software team in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, we couldn’t have gone so far without the help of the instructors and decision makers in our university.
Here we extend great thanks to the School of Life Science and Biotechnology and School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering in SJTU.
Especially, we are quite grateful to the instructors who have always supported us during the whole project. They are Dr. Chaochun Wei, Dr. Hongyu Ou, Dr. Feng Chen and Dr. Guangyu Yang.
We also thank the team SJTU-BioX-Shanghai and SUSTC-Shenzhen for providing us with detailed feedbacks on our software.
