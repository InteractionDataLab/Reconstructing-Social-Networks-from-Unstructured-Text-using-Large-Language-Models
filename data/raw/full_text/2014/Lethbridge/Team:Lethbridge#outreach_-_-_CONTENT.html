We helped <B><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Warwick">iGEM Warwick 2014</A></B> by giving insight into the public opinion on synthetic biology and how it affects society. In addition, we collaborated with <B><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Macquarie_Australia">iGEM Macquarie 2014</A></B> by participating in their &quot;So you think you can synthesize&quot; competition where each week their members would host an online Q and A about synthetic biology and contestants would move on in the competition based on the quality of their answer. We also aided <B><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Valencia_Biocampus/Results">iGEM Valencia 2014</A></B> by giving feedback on the intellectual and industrial property in the frame of synthetic biology.</P><H2>Public Outreach: University of Lethbridge Synthetic Biology Mural</H2><P>In order to spread awareness about synthetic biology at the University of Lethbridge, the iGEM team painted a mural in one of the main tunnel passageways. This tunnel experiences high student traffic and serves as a conversation starter about synthetic biology. The mural was mostly designed by one of the team’s supervisors, Will Smith. We have received a lot of positive feedback about our mural from the University of Lethbridge community, and we hope our mural will inspire others to pursue synthetic biology for years to come. </P><H2>Public Outreach: 4th Annual Brick by Brick Charity Dinner and Silent Auction</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Our iGEM team is hosting the 4th annual Brick by Brick event aimed at giving back to the community that has supported us throughout the iGEM season. Brick by Brick is a silent auction and charity dinner that will be held on November 15, 2014 at the James Foster Penny building in Lethbridge, AB. All proceeds will be donated to 5th on 5th Youth Services, a local non-profit organization that has been in the news recently due to a funding crisis.</P><P>5th on 5th Youth Services is a non-profit organization that offers a variety of programs free of charge to youths aged 15 to 30. 5th on 5th is one of Southern Alberta’s most prominent organizations in aiding youth to become productive members of the community. In general, they support youth in the areas of academic, career, and social development as well as gaining employment. You can visit their website http://youth.ab.ca/ to learn more about the services that 5th on 5th Youth Services provides and their funding crisis.
