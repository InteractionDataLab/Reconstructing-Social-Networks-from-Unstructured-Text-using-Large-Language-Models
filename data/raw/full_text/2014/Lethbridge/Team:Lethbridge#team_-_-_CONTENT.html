I'm a science loving, caffeine based life-form. My humour goes greatly under-appreciated, my socks never match, and I still have all of my wisdom teeth. I feel that my exceptional Sudoku skills make me a more well-rounded individual. Back for round 2 of iGEM and I couldn't be more excited! </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Graeme Glaister</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>I am currently finishing up my Bsc. in Neuroscience and working as a server / bartender on the weekends. This is my second year in iGEM and i look forward to the worlds competion in boston. Its always interesting to see what all the teams projects are as each year i learn something new. I also enjoy long walks on the beach and sunsets preferably both happening at the same time. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Zak Stinson</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Hey, I'm Zak, and I am an iGEMmer. I thought I was almost free of my fascination with genetic technologies when I transferred to the neuroscience program at the U of L in 2011 from biology at the U of R, but I lapsed right back when I learned that iGEM existed. I thought I had refocused when I began doing behavioural experiments with rats, but immediately searched out and executed a synthetic biology project designing a system for reporting gene activity in the brains of live animals. After completing my B.Sc. in neuroscience this summer I will likely continue to design synthetic biology projects in the M.Sc. neuroscience program at the U of L as I am dangerously hooked. So I guess I'll talk to you all next year!</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Dustin Smith</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Hello, my name is Dustin Smith. I was born and raised in Lethbridge, and I am a Master’s student majoring in Biochemistry. I’m happy to be back with the University of Lethbridge iGEM team for a fourth year, and as always it has been a great experience. Outside of school my favorite activities are ice hockey, snowboarding, and lifting. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Aubrey Demchuk</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>I am a graduate student pursuing a M.Sc. degree in Neuroscience but joined the iGEM team because I started my science career as a synthetic biology geek (with a B.Sc. in Molecular Genetics). I am also a full-time research technician at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural Neuroscience, an avid volunteer for Let’s Talk Science and a relentless adrenaline junkie (with a seriously unhealthy obsession for bikes). If you can’t find me behind a lab bench, I’m busy getting lost in the mountains. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Scott Wong</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Scott was born in Calgary but after graduating high school he quickly moved out to explore the world. However, he only made it as far as Lethbridge. There he completed a B.Sc. in Neuroscience and is currently working on a Master’s degree in the same field. What attracted him to iGEM was the opportunity to combine his interests in the brain and synthetic biology while working on a project with relevant implications in treating brain disease. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Dennis Bettenson</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Hi, my name is Dennis Bettenson, I'm a fifth year Neuroscience major and the University of Lethbridge. The main focus of my studies has been on trying to understand the underlying, neurobiological mechanisms of memory and spatial navigation. This is my first year on the Lethbridge iGEM team, and I have learned so much about synthetic biology and how it can be used in neuroscience. Aside from studying and researching, I am also an avid gamer and amateur musician! </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Kelsey O'Brien</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>I am an undergraduate student majoring in neuroscience.  My main research interest involves elucidating the neurobiological effects of wrackspurt invasion of the human brain.  I am proudly multilingual: I speak fluent English, Gibberish, Mermish, Gobbledegook, and French. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Billy Cowitz</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>I am a second year B.Sc neuroscience student and this is my first year in iGEM. I had never heard of iGEM before but after getting to university and hearing some people talk about it I thought it would be an interesting thing to be a part of. It has been fun and provided me with great new experiences that not many people get to enjoy. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Evan Caton</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Hi. My name is Evan Caton. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Biomolecular Sciences at the University of Lethbridge. I am actively involved in volunteering and teaching at the University both in the teaching labs and in the research labs. What brought me to iGEM was the ability to be involved in project design and troubleshooting. I like problem solving and team activities.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Rachael Chan</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Hi, my name is Rachael and I am a second year undergraduate student here at the U of L. I had known about iGEM in high school, but was unfortunately unable to join so when I heard about the opportunity again in post-secondary, I was intrigued. Besides being the typical undergrad student lacking time for most activities, I enjoy coaching/playing volleyball, baking, traveling, and attempting to be musically inclined. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Rhys Hakstol</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>I am a graduate of the U of L, and will be starting a Master’s Degree in Biochemistry in 2015. This is my first year with iGEM, so I’m looking forward to learning lots at this year’s competition.  I’m the proud owner of over a dozen nicknames. When I’m not in the lab I can be found on the basketball court, volunteering with Let’s Talk Science, eating beef jerky or having debates about superheroes.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Harland Brandon</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Returning for a fifth year to the iGEM scene, I have taken an advisory role mentoring the team. Currently I am working on my PhD in Biomolecular Science which takes up the majority of my time. With what spare time I have left I am advising our iGEM or taste-testing some fine strong Scottish beverages.

I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just too complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Supervisor: A. Will Smith</H2><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>I am an orphan found on a raft in the Old Man river. From the sisters who were raising me and teaching me Latin and Greek, I was kidnapped and taken to Africa to be a slave porter to carry expedition gear for a tyrant who wanted to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro. However, I escaped and hid in a cave, where I found dinosaur remains and diamonds. I told some Canadian researcher about the bones [and he later became famous] and then I took the diamonds and found my way on a steamship going to the ivory coast. There were some bad guys who blew up the ship, and I swam as fast as I could, but lost my left foot to a crocodile that had a ticking sound coming from its belly. There was a balloonist in antique clothing who was trying to gather wood to continue his journey, and though I only spoke Latin and Greek, I understood that he had traveled through time and he could take me with him. Since it was so hard to walk now with my only foot, I thought it might be a good idea to float on the wind, so I took a diamond and bought a lot of bananas, coconuts, and dried insects for us to eat on our journey. And the rest of my history is just as non-descript. The bananas turned black and rotted, but they smelled good.

Now I try to be as anonymous as possible, but I do realize that I am not going to live forever. I do speak several artistic languages, including sound design and human movement design. I started the New Media Program at the University of Lethbridge and have been living in Lethbridge for 15 years. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
