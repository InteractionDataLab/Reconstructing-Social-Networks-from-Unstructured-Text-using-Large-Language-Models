Risk Assessments
COSHH Forms
We have developed 4 COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) forms to cover Bacterial Procedures , SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis procedures, DNA Purification from bacteria and analysis of DNA , and Agarose Gels and Ethidium Bromide Staining . All student team members were required to read, sign and date each COSHH form before any laboratory work was allowed to begin.
Risk Assessment
A Genetic Modification risk assessment was submitted to the University of East Anglia to cover plant-based genetic modification brought about by Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. It is obvious from viewing this Risk Assessment that it has not yet been fully reviewed by the Safety Committee. The form was submitted to the Safety Committee at the beginning of August 2014. Since permission to conduct genetic modification of plants at UEA was not provided by the end of our summer project, no meaningful plant experiments were carried out at UEA. Instead, plant experiments were carried out at TSL following the safety regulations of the host laboratory and institute.
A big thank you to our sponsors
