Specialising in subjects ranging from Microbiology to Medicinal Biochemistry, each individual has expertise of great value to the project.  We have been supported by a group of valued advisors from The UEA, The Sainsbury Lab and The John Innes Centre with the know-how to make the most out of our summer.  Not only have we learnt new laboratory skills, we have also made a great group of friends, have had an action packed summer break and most of all created a project which we are extremely proud of.</P><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4"><H2>Mischa Spiegel</H2><H3>Course</H3><P>Molecular Biology and Genetics</P><H3>Why iGEM?</H3><P>iGEM appealed to me as the idea of using genetics and engineering to create a novel system that would be of benefit to society excited me. The fact that the project is quite student led giving an aspect of laboratory and general scientific independence is beneficial to understanding research and science generally.</P><H3>Future career ideas</H3><P>I would like to be a medical doctor specialising in Oncological Genetics</P><H3>Interests/Hobbies</H3><P>I work part time with youth, in various roles. I also enjoy partaking in various aspects of church life including directing a gospel choir at my university. I love to dance, especially ballet and swim.</P><H3>Main project roles</H3><P>Human Practices Queen</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><H2>Jessica Gray</H2><H3>Course</H3><P>Biological Sciences with a year in North America</P><H3>Why iGEM?</H3><P>I was really keen on the idea of working as a team, making new friends with similar passions and interests whilst having a fun and productive summer. I believed iGEM would be a great opportunity to improve my lab skills and provide the chance to try new things including Golden Gate cloning and html coding for the wiki.</P><H3>Future career ideas</H3><P>I have a specific passion for Microbiology and pathogenesis which I believe is rooted in my summer placement at Rothamsted Research Institute. I hope to pursue my interest in Microbiology through further study and potentially as a career.</P><H3>Interests/Hobbies</H3><P>In my free time I write a science blog, read fiction novels and watch repeats of orange is the new black, dexter and game of thrones!</P><P>Wiki Master, Golden Gate Girl</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><H2>Steven Monsey</H2><H3>Course</H3><P>Biological Sciences</P><H3>Why iGEM?</H3><P>I’ve been fascinated about biology for as long as I can remember, having been influenced by my Grandfather’s passion for the subject from a young age. University opened my mind to a wide range of biological subjects and I have taken interest in the microbial, genetic, and evolutionary disciplines. Having these interests naturally drew me to the iGEM project, which I saw as an ideal opportunity to not only broaden my mind on a wide range of innovative practices, but also to experience the day to day world of biological research. </P><H3>Future career ideas</H3><P>If the right opportunity arises after my degree I would relish the chance to enter into biological research myself; however, the education of children in science is a subject close to my heart and I would love to pursue a career in teaching.</P><H3>Interests/Hobbies</H3><P>Outside of biology and university I am a passionate musician and football fan.</P><H3>Main project roles</H3><P>Human Practices King</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4"><H2>Alistair Middlemiss</H2><H3>Course</H3><P>Microbiology with integrated Msc</P><H3>Why iGEM?</H3><P>I applied to the iGEM team as I wanted to develop my scientific skills as well as challenge myself in areas that I had no expertise in for example, the Wiki, and Human Practices.  I have been interested in science since I was a child and as I grew, I developed an interest in microbiology; our project utilises microbiology which is what grabbed me.  The iGEM competition itself is very well regarded and of a high academic standard which will allow me to excel in my future scientific career.  </P><H3>Future career ideas</H3><P>I am fascinated by bacterial pathogenesis and infection and immunity so I hope to spend my career in that field of microbiology.  I have spent some time in hospitals in the past and wish to eventually work in the health sector so I can give back some of the fantastic treatment I received whilst in hospital.</P><H3>Interests/Hobbies</H3><P>When I’m not sitting on the sofa or at my part-time job, my spare time is usually spent playing Ultimate Frisbee!</P><H3>Main project roles</H3><P>Infiltration Prince, Lab Clown</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><H2>Jack Day</H2><H3>Course</H3><P>Biological and Medicinal Chemistry</P><H3>Why iGEM?</H3><P>I got involved in iGEM as I just could not let this opportunity go to waste. The ability to work in a team on a project of our own design is an experience not many get the chance to pursue. iGEM gives participants the chance to see and explore research not otherwise taught during a standard degree and how the inner workings of a research project is undertaken.</P><H3>Future career ideas</H3><P>Whilst still being on the fence about continuing my education and studying for a Phd after I graduate, I would like to work in the field of understanding and developing treatments for neurodegenerative disease. </P><H3>Interests/Hobbies</H3><P>I have played cricket for the vast majority of my life and is my bread and butter. I also dabble in the art of juggling. Also I have a keen interest in social and behavioural psychology as a side interest to biochemistry.</P><H3>Main project roles</H3><P>Funding Guru, Lab Safety Emperor</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><H2>Cara Deal</H2><H3>Course</H3><P>Biomedicine</P><H3>Why iGEM?</H3><P>The iGEM competition appealed to me as it allowed us to design our own project and work within a team to achieve our aims.  I wanted to get some experience working in a lab and learning the techniques used in synthetic biology as well as developing skills in communicating science to a wide variety of people.</P><H3>Future career ideas</H3><P>After completing my degree in Biomedicine I would like to work in a Research lab, specialising in Biochemistry.</P><H3>Interests/Hobbies</H3><P>I enjoy playing sports such as football and hockey and have been dancing for 15 years.  I have also completed my Gold Duke of Edinburgh’s award which I really enjoyed doing.</P><H3>Main project roles</H3><P>Lab Queen Bee, Life Organiser, Golden Gate Girl</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-2 col-md-offset-1"><H2>Dr Richard Bowater</H2><P>Richard is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Biological Sciences at UEA with a particular interest in biochemistry.
