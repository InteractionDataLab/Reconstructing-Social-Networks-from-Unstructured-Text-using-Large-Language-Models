Safety Overview
Safety must be considered in a very serious manner. In doing so, many aspects were discussed (from personal safety to public safety) and action was taken upon each point. We believe that we have statisfied the iGEM criteria for safety including the safety form and the check-ins. We have also satisfied the safety criteria for the University of East Anglia by creating and filling out relevant COSHH forms and Risk Assessments as well as adhering to more general laboratory safety practices.
A big thank you to our sponsors
