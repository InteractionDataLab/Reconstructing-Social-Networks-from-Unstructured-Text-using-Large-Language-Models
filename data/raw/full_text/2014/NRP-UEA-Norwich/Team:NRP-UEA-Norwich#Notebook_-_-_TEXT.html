Lab Notebook
We have documented the day to day progress of our iGEM project in our online Lab Notebook, which includes our wet lab experiments, policy and practices planning and outreach events.
Initial Project Discussions
We began the project with several meetings at TSL and UEA with project supervisors and all iGEM students to brainstorm ideas for this years iGEM project.
We discussed global issues and food security proved to be a recurrent and prominent theme
As we were working closely with TSL and wanted to maximise the expertise available to us, we decided on a plant based project.
We researched the global staple food crops which included rice, infected by the pathogen Xanthamonas and decided to design a biosensor to detect the presence of Xanthamonas.
Although we were aware of the reporter GFP, we wanted a reporter which was visible to the naked eye so a farmer could easily detect infection in a crop and therefore suggested chromoproteins.
The name of our project, Green Canary, represents our engagement in Green Biotechnology. The Canary is both the emblem of Norwich City, our local professional football team, and an idiom for an early indicator of coming danger.

Week Two 23/06/2014
Monday
Completed The Sainsbury Laboratory (TSL) safety induction.
Collected synthesised samples from DNA 2.0 and transformed DNA into E.coli using electrocompetent cells and electroporation.
Added 500 μl of Soc broth and incubated for 40 minutes at 37 °C. Spreadplated onto agar plates containing Kanamycin and incubated O/N at 37 °C.
Tuesday
Selected a single colony from each of the eleven plates and the colonies were grown in TY broth with Kanamycin O/N.
Transformation of pSB1C3 plasmid containing RFP into E.coli using electroporation. Incubated with 50 μl of Soc broth at 37 °C for 1 hour.
Spreadplated E.coli cells which have been transformed with the pSB1C3 + RFP plasmid.
Completed calculations for Dig-Lig experiments (Size and conc. of DNA parts calculated,size of acceptor calculated, order of constructs for each reaction determined, dilution and DNA conc. for each reaction determined) Ratio of 2:1, constructs:acceptor (plasmid).
Wednesday
Midi prep following the Qiagen protocol of the 9 constructs previously synthesised by DNA 2.0 and transformed on Day 2 and DNA conc. of each construct determined using the nanodrop.
Dig-Lig calculation spread sheet completed using DNA concentration, plasmid:insert 2:1.
Set up the first 11 Dig-Lig experiments, placed into PCR block on the slow protocol.
Carbenicillin plates made and spreadplated with 40 μl of XGAL and 100 μl of IPTG. Plates left to dry upside down in 37°C incubator.
Transformation of GG DNA into electrocompetent E.coli cells, PROTOCOL:
Cells removed from -80°C freezer and allowed to thaw.
A 5 µl sample of DNA was added to a 50 µl aliquot of cells.
Transferred each 55 µl sample into a cuvette.
Electroporation pulse on setting ECR1.
A 500 µl aliquot of SOC broth was added to the cuvette.
A 555 µl cuvette sample was transferred to an eppendorf tube and incubated for 40 min at 37°C.
A 100 µl sample was spreadplated onto agar plates containing carbenicillin and incubated O/N at 37°C.
A 20 µl PCR reaction was set up using a GG level 1 acceptor as template DNA containing the primers P1: 0349(PRO+5U) and 0353 (3U+TER) and P2: 0350 (PRO+5U) and 0354 (3U+TER).
A TBE buffer 1% agarose gel was poured for diagnostic purposes to check the amplification of the PCR products.
PCR product purification
Pre-percipitation to remove TAQ polymerase and protein was completed followed by phenolchloroform extraction (x2). Aqueous layer is removed and discarded leaving DNA.
Precipitation to remove buffer was carried out by adding Na acetate (10%) and ethanol causing the DNA to come out of solution. Aspirator was used to remove buffer, salt and ethanol.
A salt wash was completed to remove the acetate and ethanol.
Sample was incubated at 65°C for 2 min to evaporate the ethanol.
Thursday
Checked Dig-Lig tranformation plates grown O/N and poor blue white selection observed with many blue colonies.
Selected 2 white colonies from each plate and colony PCR performed to check whether DNA corresponded to the DNA expected.
Following colony PCR, amplified fragments ran on gel to determine size and therefore whether they contained the construct.
Decided to repeat the 11 Dig-Lig experiments.
Ran digested PCR product from 25.06.2014 on a diagnostic 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer and determined that LacZ had internal restriction enzyme cut sites and product was split into two bands.
Friday
Found poor blue/white selection on dig-ligs from 26.06.14. Suspected to be due to either the enzyme used or PCR block settings.
Set up a new set of dig-ligs to test the source of this problem.
Week Three 30/06/2014
Monday
Set up 10 Dig-Lig reactions with new BSA1 enzyme provided by TSL.

Mini-prep of DNA obtained from Week 2's successful Dig-Lig experiments according to Qiagen protocol. However, DNA eluted in 25 µl of eluting buffer rather than 50 µl as protocol suggests.
DNA conc. of each sample quanitifed using the Nanodrop.
