Meet our Team
The NRP iGEM 2014 team is a diverse group of six enthusiastic undergraduate students based at the University of East Anglia. Specialising in subjects ranging from Microbiology to Medicinal Biochemistry, each individual has expertise of great value to the project.  We have been supported by a group of valued advisors from The UEA, The Sainsbury Lab and The John Innes Centre with the know-how to make the most out of our summer.  Not only have we learnt new laboratory skills, we have also made a great group of friends, have had an action packed summer break and most of all created a project which we are extremely proud of.

Course
Molecular Biology and Genetics
Why iGEM?
iGEM appealed to me as the idea of using genetics and engineering to create a novel system that would be of benefit to society excited me. The fact that the project is quite student led giving an aspect of laboratory and general scientific independence is beneficial to understanding research and science generally.
Future career ideas
I would like to be a medical doctor specialising in Oncological Genetics
Interests/Hobbies
I work part time with youth, in various roles. I also enjoy partaking in various aspects of church life including directing a gospel choir at my university. I love to dance, especially ballet and swim.
Main project roles
Human Practices Queen
Jessica Gray
Course
Biological Sciences with a year in North America
Why iGEM?
I was really keen on the idea of working as a team, making new friends with similar passions and interests whilst having a fun and productive summer. I believed iGEM would be a great opportunity to improve my lab skills and provide the chance to try new things including Golden Gate cloning and html coding for the wiki.
Future career ideas
I have a specific passion for Microbiology and pathogenesis which I believe is rooted in my summer placement at Rothamsted Research Institute. I hope to pursue my interest in Microbiology through further study and potentially as a career.
Interests/Hobbies
In my free time I write a science blog, read fiction novels and watch repeats of orange is the new black, dexter and game of thrones!
Wiki Master, Golden Gate Girl
Steven Monsey
Course
Biological Sciences
Why iGEM?
I’ve been fascinated about biology for as long as I can remember, having been influenced by my Grandfather’s passion for the subject from a young age. University opened my mind to a wide range of biological subjects and I have taken interest in the microbial, genetic, and evolutionary disciplines. Having these interests naturally drew me to the iGEM project, which I saw as an ideal opportunity to not only broaden my mind on a wide range of innovative practices, but also to experience the day to day world of biological research.
Future career ideas
If the right opportunity arises after my degree I would relish the chance to enter into biological research myself; however, the education of children in science is a subject close to my heart and I would love to pursue a career in teaching.
Interests/Hobbies
Outside of biology and university I am a passionate musician and football fan.
Main project roles
Human Practices King
Alistair Middlemiss
Course
Microbiology with integrated Msc
Why iGEM?
I applied to the iGEM team as I wanted to develop my scientific skills as well as challenge myself in areas that I had no expertise in for example, the Wiki, and Human Practices.  I have been interested in science since I was a child and as I grew, I developed an interest in microbiology; our project utilises microbiology which is what grabbed me.  The iGEM competition itself is very well regarded and of a high academic standard which will allow me to excel in my future scientific career.
Future career ideas
I am fascinated by bacterial pathogenesis and infection and immunity so I hope to spend my career in that field of microbiology.  I have spent some time in hospitals in the past and wish to eventually work in the health sector so I can give back some of the fantastic treatment I received whilst in hospital.
Interests/Hobbies
When I’m not sitting on the sofa or at my part-time job, my spare time is usually spent playing Ultimate Frisbee!
Main project roles
Infiltration Prince, Lab Clown
Jack Day
Course
Biological and Medicinal Chemistry
Why iGEM?
I got involved in iGEM as I just could not let this opportunity go to waste. The ability to work in a team on a project of our own design is an experience not many get the chance to pursue. iGEM gives participants the chance to see and explore research not otherwise taught during a standard degree and how the inner workings of a research project is undertaken.
Future career ideas
Whilst still being on the fence about continuing my education and studying for a Phd after I graduate, I would like to work in the field of understanding and developing treatments for neurodegenerative disease.
Interests/Hobbies
I have played cricket for the vast majority of my life and is my bread and butter. I also dabble in the art of juggling. Also I have a keen interest in social and behavioural psychology as a side interest to biochemistry.
Main project roles
Funding Guru, Lab Safety Emperor
Cara Deal
Course
Biomedicine
Why iGEM?
The iGEM competition appealed to me as it allowed us to design our own project and work within a team to achieve our aims.  I wanted to get some experience working in a lab and learning the techniques used in synthetic biology as well as developing skills in communicating science to a wide variety of people.
Future career ideas
After completing my degree in Biomedicine I would like to work in a Research lab, specialising in Biochemistry.
Interests/Hobbies
I enjoy playing sports such as football and hockey and have been dancing for 15 years.  I have also completed my Gold Duke of Edinburgh’s award which I really enjoyed doing.
Main project roles

Dr Richard Bowater
Richard is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Biological Sciences at UEA with a particular interest in biochemistry. He and his research group have characterised DNA repair processes from a variety of organisms. This research feeds into mechanisms that influence genome stability. Furthermore, he is on the editorial advisory panel of the journal of Biochemistry and The Scientific World Journal.
Dr Colwyn Thomas
Colwyn is a Senior Lecturer in the School of Biological Sciences at UEA, particularly interested in plant molecular genetics. His research is concentrated on determining the genetic and molecular basis of resistance or susceptibility to pathogen infection in plants. Furthermore, he is a mentor for the Gatsby Plant Science undergraduate programme. His proudest achievement is being a member of one of the first groups in the world to isolate and characterise a plant disease resistance gene – tomato Cf-9 at The Sainsbury Laboratory.
Dr Nicola Patron
Nicola is the head of Synthetic Biology and a senior support specialist at The Sainsbury Laboratory. Her research is focused on developing molecular tools and methods for the precise modification of plant genomes, efficient high-order DNA assembly and the controlled delivery of molecular tools into plant cells.
Dr Anna Smajdor
Anna is Lecturer and researcher in biomedical ethics. Her research interests are focused on the ethical implications of innovation and research in all areas of the biosciences, including: new reproductive technologies; research ethics and governance; justice and resource allocation. She has been vice chair of the Riverside Research Ethics Committee for several years and is a member of clinical ethics committees in London and Norwich.
Dr Mark Banfield
Mark is a Biological Chemistry project leader at the John Innes Centre (JIC). Mark studies structure/function relationships in effector proteins from pathogens of mammals and plants. He also studies the host side of plant immunity, through the use of biochemical, biophysical and structural studies. Furthermore, many of his studies are aimed at engineering plants to better resist infection from pathogens, improving performance in agriculture with a reduced need for chemical interventions.
