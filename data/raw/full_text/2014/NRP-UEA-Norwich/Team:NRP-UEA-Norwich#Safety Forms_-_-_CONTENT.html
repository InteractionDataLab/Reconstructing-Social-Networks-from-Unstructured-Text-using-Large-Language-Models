The Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 to be used is is a disarmed strain that lacks a functional tumour-inducing plasmid and instead contains a defective plasmid (dTi) that provides the necessary 'vir' gene functions for T-DNA synthesis and secretion into plant cells. Agrobacterium tumefaciens is not known to be harmful to humans. 

Good laboratory practice and knowledge of the risk assessments should minimise all potential risks to laboratory personnel.

The laboratory strains used are likely to be less fit to survive in the environment than wild type strains meaning that the potential risk of harm or infection to the general public is reduced. In the event of accidental release into the environment, no realistic implications are predicted.</TEXTAREA><P class="qbody"><SPAN class="qnum">c)</SPAN> Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):</P><TEXTAREA cols="100" rows="6" id="env_risks_now" data-form-field="env_risks_now">The ability of the E. coli and A. tumefaciens strains to survive in the environment is unknown. However, it is likely that the laboratory strains used are not as fit to survive in the environment compared to wild-type strains and therefore pose less of a risk. 

Genetically modified plants can horizontally transmit DNA to unmodified neighbouring plants of the same species, causing potential contamination of the un-modified food supply. However, as all experiments involving agrobacterium will be confined to plant growth rooms, the risk of contamination to the environment is reduced.</TEXTAREA><P class="qbody"><SPAN class="qnum">d)</SPAN> Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:</P><TEXTAREA cols="100" rows="2" id="security_now" data-form-field="security_now">There are no known serious implications accociated with accidental release of the E. coli and A. tumefaciens strains as the laboratory strains used are less fit than wild-type strains or have no known pathogenicity.

This will include restricted access to authorised workers, ensuring that all areas are swabbed with a recommended disinfectant, no laboratory clothing allowed outside of the laboratory and all outdoor clothing will be stored in offices. All contaminated waste will be autoclaved. 

To reduce DNA transmission to neighbouring plants, the genetically modified plants will be confined to the laboratory and will be autoclaved after use. Any experiments involving Agrobacterium tumefaciens in transient expression experiments in Nicotiana benthamiana will be conducted in plant growth rooms that provide the necessary level of containment for infiltrated plants. All plant material in these growth rooms (whether infiltrated or not) will ultimately be destroyed by autoclaving in accordance with our institutional safety requirements.
