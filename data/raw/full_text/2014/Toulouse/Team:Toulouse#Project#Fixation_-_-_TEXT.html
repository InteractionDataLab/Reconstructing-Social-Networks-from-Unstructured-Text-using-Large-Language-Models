SubtiTree binds to the fungal pathogen
First, the attachment of the bacterium is allowed by the introduction of a chimeric protein recognizing bacterial peptidoglycan and carrying a binding domain chitin - CBD - which, in contrast to the receiver of chemotaxis, would recognize a long oligomer. We make a fusion protein domain CWB LytC B. subtilis and domain 4 GBPA V. cholerae. The verification of the construction is made thanks to an ELISA test.
