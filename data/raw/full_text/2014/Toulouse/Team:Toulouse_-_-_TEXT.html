SubtiTree project
Fungal diseases lead to major economic losses all over the world. Some pathogens trigger tracheomycosis by disturbing the vascular system of the plant. Canker is one of these infections especially affecting plane trees (Platanus sp.). Plane trees are widely present in Southern France and in particular along the famous Canal du Midi, participating to the site gorgeousness. Today, the only treatment consists in a costly preventive tree-cutting and implies significant ecological troubles. Facing this emergency, our team offers an innovative solution originating from synthetic biology.
