Figure 1: Schema of the fungicide module
The main objective of SubtiTree is to ensure the destruction of the pathogenic fungi inside the tree.   In order to achieve this goal, we built a genetic module to produce three different peptides with antifungal activities. This triple therapy provides    the advantage to minimize the resistance phenomenon.
Originally from plants, these peptides have different targets thus increasing the lethality on Ceratocystis platani.
D4E1 is a synthetic peptide analog to Cecropin B AMPs (AntiMicrobial Peptides) made of 17 amino acids  which has been shown to have an antifungal activity by complexing with a sterol present in the conidia’s wall of numerous fungi.
GAFP-1 (Gastrodia Anti Fungal Protein 1), also known as gastrodianin, is a mannose and chitin binding lectin  originating from the Asiatic orchid Gastrodia elata, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb cultured for thousands of years.   GAFP-1 accumulates in nutritive corms where the fungal infection takes place, and in vitro assays demonstrated it can inhibit the growth of   ascomycete and basidiomycete fungal plant pathogens.
EcAMP-1 (Echinochloa crus-galli AntiMicrobial Peptide) consists in 37 amino acids inhibiting hyphae elongation  EcAMP-1 is the first example of AMP with a novel disulfide-stabilized-α helical hairpin fold. It is isolated from kernels of barnyard grass.  EcAMP-1 exhibits high activity against fungi of the genus Fusarium.
More information about this module
We built different genetic constructions to test each fungicide separately and to test them all together on the same operon. The three genes coding for the  antifungal peptides are placed under the control of the constitutive promoter Pveg in Bacillus subtilis.

Added parts
EcAMP-1
EcAMP-1 was already present in the Registry, added by the Utah State 2013 iGEM team  ( BBa_K1162001 ). This part has been modified and improved by our team  ( BBa_K1364019 ) with the addition of a STOP codon after the coding sequence.
D4E1 and GAFP-1
We added D4E1 and GAFP-1 to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts  (See Submitted parts ).
These new BioBricks were designed in order to be expressed and secreted with B. subtilis.
Secretion
In order to export the peptides outside the bacteria, the coding sequences of D4E1 and GAFP-1 were flanked on the N-terminal end with  a signal peptide (amyE signal peptide) followed by a pro peptide, cleaved during the secretion process.
