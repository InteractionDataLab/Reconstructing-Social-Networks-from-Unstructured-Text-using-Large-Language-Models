Let's introduce you to our fabulous tree-friendly team, 100% biodegradable and certified pesticide-free.
Students
(Move your mouse over image to enlarge!)
Diane Barbay
Feature: Diligent (Wait a minute, I have to write down these results in my notebook! ㅋㅋㅋ)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About her: Hardworking, Diane is the most consciencious in her work: her notebook is so clean and organized! She is persevering and always tries to find the answer to the problem (except when plasmids shortens between two digestions…). She talks to bacteria to encourage them taking up plasmid during transformation. She is like a babysitter for our cells :-)
Emeline Flajollet
Feature: Expert in competent cells (Oh no, I have to make competent cells again… ㅋㅋㅋ)
Studies: First year of Master of Microbiology at Paul Sabatier University of Toulouse
About her: Emeline looks discreet at first, but when you meet her, you discover a frank person who knows how to express her opinions and how to be understood, which is a good thing for team work. She is diligent and involved in her work, always trying to do her best, and providing advice to others. She spends a lot of time on social networks, allowing us to keep in touch with other teams.
Mathieu Fournié
Feature: Expert in communication (I found someone else who wants to interview us!)
Studies: First year of Master of Microbiology at Paul Sabatier University of Toulouse
About him: Initial founder of the project, Mathieu is a fan of Midi Pyrenées's region and is eager to protect its natural environment and resources. He is devoted to the project and does his best to succeed. His leadership skills help us focus on the main goals and deadlines. Even if it makes him forget to do his own tasks! His good interpersonal skills and numerous contacts helped us to capture media attention.
Florie Gosseau
Feature: Our IT expert (Modeling? Ok let’s do it!)
Studies: First year of Bioinformatics and Biological Systems Master at Paul Sabatier University of Toulouse
About her: Florie is a smiling and spontaneous girl. She is this kind of person capable of giving a true smile when nothing works, and she can disentangle conflicts thanks to her patience and her kindness. She is really helpful and never says no when you ask for service. She is also frank and reports problems when there are some. Finally, she is the only one good at informatics, which makes her indispensable for us! When she wears her lab coat, she is able to fly like Batman or being the queen of cats' kingdom. Really, it is wonderful to see her!
Camille Jourdan
Feature: Expert in cloning (Camille, which enzyme should I take?)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About him: Jovial and funny, Camille has sometimes eruptions of madness which makes him so special. Conversely, he is capable of incredible moments of intelligence and concentration (primers and plasmids hold no secret for him) and he is really diligent. He is sarcastic but definitely not nasty. He is the athlete of the team and never misses an opportunity to make gymnastics exercises or Plasmid Dance!
Aurélie Kanitzer
Feature: Distracted (Oh I forgot my keys! I have to go back home, see you in 15 minutes!)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About her: Aurélie is a joyful and spontaneous person, which makes you laugh and smile. Often distracted, she can make blunders… She is natural and honest and does not try to play a role. She is open-minded and helpful: you can count on her. Strong and sensitive at the same time, she is able to face difficulties. Don’t go by appearances, this tiny girl has personality and she does not let others walk over her!
Laureen Mirassou
Feature: Our best negotiator (Don’t worry about prices for flight tickets, I deal with that)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About her: Laureen is a mix of kindness, helpfulness and generosity. Always trying to help people, she is essential to ease tensions and to solve social issues: she says what is wrong gently and calmly. Her good interpersonal abilities helped us to make good business and to solve many administrative problems. Her high level of English proficiency is also something precious for the team.
Manon Molina
Feature: Organized (Let’s make a to-do-list!)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About her: Manon is organized: she always makes to-do-lists to not  forget anything and do tasks in time. Thank goodness, she is here to monitor the budget and do the accounting! She makes her work conscientiously and meticulously, not allowing mistakes. She is kind and lenient but can also be frank when she does not endorse your methods. In short: serious and devoted to the project.
Fanny Pineau
Feature: Absent-minded (which cloning are we doing?)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About her: In the lab, Fanny is often lost in her works: too many cloning at the same time, you should not ask too much to her blond brain! Not enough concentrated, she can sometimes make blunders. Besides that, she is applied and perfectionist when she plunges into her work. Finally, she is a joyful and smiling person; also honest and frank, telling it like it is.
Pierre Reitzer
Feature: Relaxed (Make a presentation barefoot, why not?)
Studies: First year of Biochemistry Master at INSA Toulouse engineering school
About him: Pierre is the co-founder of the project. He is really friendly and is always willing to discuss and help people with their experiments. Moreover, he greets us with a smile each time we see him in the lab. He is spontaneous and forthright: we know what he thinks. Sometimes, he has his head in the clouds and fails the same experiment three times… But he is involved in his work and does not count hours.
Abdel Touré
Feature: Luxury tastes (Why shouldn't we go to the Hilton?)
Studies: First year of Bioinformatics and Biological Systems Master at Paul Sabatier University of Toulouse
About him: Abdel is this kind of person that you remember: he is always jovial and running everywhere. He is a funny guy who likes making jokes. But, be careful! He is also sensitive, your jokes might not make him laugh at all. He takes care of his appearance, and likes smoking his e-cigarette. He always swears in English, but we like it because this is funny, and he is a good English speaker!
Instructors
Gilles Truan
Feature: Our amazing instructor!
Job: Senior Researcher at CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) and at LISBP (Laboratoire d'Ingénierie des Systèmes Biologiques et des Procédés).
About him: He is with us from the beginning to the end as a father (and already a grandfather!!), our instructor is the master of cloning and the captain of PCR! He provided us with valuable help and good tips he learned at the time he was supervising Marie Curie's doctoral thesis.
Brice Enjalbert
Feature: The right-hand man of our amazing instructor!
Job: Lecturer at LISBP (Laboratoire d'Ingénierie des Systèmes Biologiques et des Procédés).
