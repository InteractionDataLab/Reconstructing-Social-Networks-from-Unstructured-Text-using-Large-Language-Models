Parts
As the chassis B. subtilis is not as used as E. coli,  it was sometimes hard for us the get or find desired parts.
However, with the collaboration of other iGEM and a synthesis compagny, we managed to obtain or make the following parts:
Submitted parts
We have deposed X new BioBrick parts to the Registry.  All of them were cloned into the standard plasmid pSB1C3, tested and sequenced.
Chemotaxis
BBa_K1364000: Strong RBS for B. subtilis ( K780001 )  + Chemotaxis code  + Double terminator ( B0015 )
N-acetylglucosamine based chemotaxis:
This part is designed to enable a N-acetylglucosamine  based chemotaxis in Bacillus subtilis.
Design:
The encoded protein is a chimera of two proteins:
- the methyl accepting Chemotaxis protein (McpA from Bacillus subtilis which is required for taxis towards glucose.
- the N-acetylglucosamine regulated methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein from Vibrio cholerae (VCD).
The chimeric protein contains the intracellular domains of McpA from Bacillus subtilis to enable the transduction of the signal:  these domains correspond to the amino acids 1-37 and 282-610.  The extracellular domain of VCD is inserted between the intracellular regions of McpA  to sense N-acetylglucosamine and corresponds to the amino acids 31-310.

Binding
BBa_K1364001: Consensus RBS for B. subtilis ( K090505 ) + Binding code + Double terminator ( B0015 )
Binding module:
This part is designed to enable the binding of Bacillus subtilis to the fungi wall made of chitin.
Design:
This part is composed of a Cell Wall Binding (CWB) sequence  and a Chitin Binding Domain (CBD) linked with a 6 amino acids linker.
The CWB domain has been extracted from LytC ( BBa_K316030 ) of the iGEM 2010 Imperial College team.
The CBD is composed of the Domain 4 of the GbpA protein of Vibrio cholerae, a protein reported to mediate bacterial attachment to chitin.  It has been shown that the Domain 4 was essential to bind chitin.
