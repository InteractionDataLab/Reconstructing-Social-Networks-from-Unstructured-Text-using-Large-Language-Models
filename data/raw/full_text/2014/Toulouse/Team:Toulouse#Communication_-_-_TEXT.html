We participated to a lot of public communications about synthetic biology and our project:

Pierre and Florie during the Agora.
Florie and Fanny during the Exposcience.
- The Journées de l’Ecole Doctorale Biologie, Santé, Biotechnologies (17th April 2014). This day was dedicated to the exhibition of PhD's results with posters.  We came with a poster explaining what is the iGEM competition.
- The Exposcience in Toulouse (5th june 2014).  We were there during the whole day.  We met hundreds of people and explained our project.  We brought lab stuff and a poster describing the iGEM competition.
