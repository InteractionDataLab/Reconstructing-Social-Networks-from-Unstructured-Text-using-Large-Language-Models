2014 Giant Jamboree Results !
The 2014 Toulouse iGEM team had a lot of fun during the AMAZING Giant Jamboree in Boston ... And all the work done was rewarded by a GOLD medal and the Best Prize "Innovation in measurement" !
Let's sum up what we did during this summer!
First step...
After a summer of hard work, our team is proud of the achieved results. The first step of our project was to have a proof of concept of the three functions requiered to fight against canker. The verifications of our genetic constructions were successful (PCR, Migration on an agarose gel and Sequencing). We could then proceed to specific test of the modules: capillary test, chitin beads test or fungicide tests.
Second step...
Once these results obtained, we decided to move on to the next step: in order to get closer to our final objective, the three genetic modules have to be assembled and to be tested in model plants. In the short time we had, these tests were only performed with the antifungal module, but the results were very encouraging (See 3. In planta tests with SubtiTree in the Fungicides module).
Third step...
So encouraging that we moved on to the third step of our project and think about the real injection of SubtiTree in diseased trees. We then considered the spreading problems and proposed different strategies to avoid this major issue. Modeling enables us to predict the growth and the lifespan of SubtiTree in Plane Trees.
And what comes next?
With  the support of Governmental institutions, scientific organizations and the popular enthusiasm raised by our project, we are still looking for the best way to continue and achieve our goal: save the plane trees and preserve the beauty of the Canal du Midi.
However, SubtiTree's spreading must be controlled, fungicide production regulated, specifity improved, tests of the whole system performed. In a nutshell, we still have a lot of things to do even if we did our best during the whole summer!
iGEM Community
Well aware that we are part of the iGEM Community, our team also worked for this community by improving the iGEMer's Bible: the Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
We improved the EcAMP-1 BioBrick by adding a promotor, a RBS, but mainly by the addition of a STOP codon ( BBa_K1364019 ).
As Bacillus subtilis appears to be for us an  ideal chassis, we also developed new genetic tools to facilitate its utilization. Thanks to numerous interactions with other iGEM teams, we didn't see the time flying by during this amazing summer !
It is better to have "well-made rather than a well-filled head"... (Michel de Montaigne)
We developed a deep ethical questioning , trying to understand the relationship between Science and the protection of the Beauty. We strongly believe that neglecting the ethical aspect in a scientific project is a mistake. All the team was involved in this part and the reflexions made were very profitable to us.
We filled the 2014 Judging Form thanks to the following accomplishments:
Medals Fulfillment
Bronze Medal
Silver Medal
Gold Medal
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Jamboree
Experimentally validate that at least three new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction work as expected.
