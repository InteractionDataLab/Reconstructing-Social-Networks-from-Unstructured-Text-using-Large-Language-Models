Our team is proud to say that we did almost all the work by ourselves : finding sponsors, making communication tools about our project, finding the protocols to use and testing them, ...
However, we needed occasional assistance during our project, it is why we required help from different people : scientists, administrators, specialists and even normal citizens. We would like to warmly thank all these persons for their contribution and their support, whatever the kind of it. Our project could move forward because they offered their help.
Ulule: a crowdfunding website to help us finding funds
Ulule is the first european crowdfunding website. We have posted our SubtiTree project on this site to collect funds for paying the Giant Jamboree fee. The collect was successful : we had 42 supporters and 1293€ collected.

Scientists
iGEM instructors
In first, we warmly thank our amazing instructor : Gilles Truan.  He was with us from the beginning to the end and even more ! He is the master of cloning. He is the captain of PCR.  Moreover, he knows how to grill sausages better than anyone !
We warmly thank all the other instructors that helped us when we were lost with the scientific part or stressed by the lack of money...  We especially thank Brice Enjalbert, Florence Bordes, Kaymeuang Cam, Philippe Soucaille, Stéphane Guillouet, Isabelle Meynial-Salles and Alain Marty. Your advice and encouragements were very precious to us, and you deserve these thanks for all the energy you spent answering our questions (and we know that we are very energy-consuming!).
To finish, a special thank to Claude Maranges, who helped us a lot with the sponsoring aspect and all the administrative problems that we encountered.  Indeed, if you had an administrative issue, he is able to solve it in less than 2 minutes (5 minutes during the holidays).  He know how to make everything ok in record time.
Bacillus subtilis specialists
Even if Bacillus subtilis is a gram-positive bacterium model, no one of our instructors worked on it. It is why we asked other people's help when we had question about B. subtilis.
We would like to thank Nathalie Campo for her advice about B. subtilis culture, her encouragements and her kindness.
Her friend Thierry Doan helped us too : he brilliantly answered to our questions about B. subtilis.
We also thank Sarah Guiziou, ex-iGEMer, for her advice and her protocols.
Fungi specialists
We are grateful to Christophe Roux who gave us two non-pathogenic strains of fungi : Aspergillus brasiliensis and Chaetomium globusum.
We used them to test our SubtiTree system.
Other iGEM teams
Since several parts that we wanted to use was not in the iGEM kit plates, we asked iGEM teams to send us some parts :
Thanks to the iGEM Warsaw team, especially Radoslaw Stachowiak, for sending us the biobricks BBa_K780000 , BBa_K780001 , BBa_K780002 and BBa_K780003 .

Lab support
Thanks to Sylvie Cancel and Yves Dutruy, lab technicians, for helping us when we did not know where to find Yeast Extract or how to use the new refrigerated centrifuge.
They were with us as soon as we began the manipulations and they answer to all our stupid questions.
To finish, thanks to Fabien Albert, storeman of the LISBP, for his sympathy and his availability.
