What do trees lining the “Canal du Midi” think about SubtiTree?
According to our homemade impartial survey, 94% of the questioned plane trees approve our project and are interested in  serving as guinea pigs for our new bacterial medicine. This percentage represents 41,580 trees which  are also gathered in the association called: “Happy tree friends“.
Have you ever tried to estimate the kilometers traveled by your team during this summer?
According to our calculations, one team member walks approximately 4 kilometers per day all around the  laboratory. This represents 5,544 kilometers for the whole team during the 126 days of this epic  adventure.  What does that mean exactly? Simply that we could walk, cycle, swim or whatever you want to  Kazakhstan, Russia, Kenya… We could even have reached the USA but we decided to stay in the lab  and take the plane to go to Boston!
Multidisciplinary… Yes we are!
Housework in our laboratory became necessary when most of people were in vacations except us.  But do you know the novelty this year in our team? Times are changing because now men are  cleaning! ;-)
The “can’t miss it” event of the summer: the 2014 Football (also called Soccer in some third zone countries!!) World Cup!
From 06/12/14 to 07/13/14, the Toulouse iGEM Team was cheering for the French team. During the  games of the French team, our group was juggling with wet lab and large screen projections! Despite  our support, the French team did not win the World Cup. However, we have not said our last world  yet: let’s see what will happen in 2018… ;-)
Have you ever...
...forgotten a tube culture or a Petri dish?
Never? Let us show you what happens in that case!
...tried to make a 3% agarose gel?
To finish this part, let’s do the official Awards Ceremony of the 2014 Toulouse iGEM Team!
The Geek Award goes to... Florie who spent the longest time in front of her laptop for the modeling part!
The latest-survivor-of-weekly-meetings goes to... Diane who stayed up until 3am because she was skyping from South Korea!
The worst singer award goes to ... Abdel who  spent the whole day singing badly in the lab!
The dancer award goes to ... Camille who did the famous Plasmid Dance!
The “hello you” award goes to... Pierre who was always saying  “Hello you” each time he meets someone (approximatively 256 times per day)!
The most tired award goes to... Manon but we still do not know why!
The misplaced ideas award goes to... Mathieu but you do not want to know why!
The perseverance award goes to... Emeline who succeeded a cloning after twelve trials!
The drawing award goes to... Fanny who drew our first SubtiTree logo!
The best phone-caller award goes to... Laureen who was our perfect lab secretary!
The biggest blunder in the lab award goes to ... Aurélie who poured an agarose gel without gel tray!
And last but not least ... The Best Nervous breakdown Award goes to ... Our -20°C freezer! The whole team is grateful for its hard work during a hot summer! Three successive breakdowns during the hot days of summer: thank you freezer, so long chap, we’ll unplug you after iGEM is finished and you’ll retire, hopefully not in the Canal du Midi…
