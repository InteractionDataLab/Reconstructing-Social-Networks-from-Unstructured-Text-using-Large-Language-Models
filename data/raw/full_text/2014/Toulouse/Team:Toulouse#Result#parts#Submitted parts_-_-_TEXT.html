Parts
What did we send to the Registry?
Results    >    Parts    >   Submitted parts
We deposited 16 new BioBrick parts in the Registry.  Most of them were cloned into the standard plasmid pSB1C3, tested and sequenced.
All our Biobrick are resumed in Parts Sandbox .
Chemotaxis
BBa_K1364000
Strong RBS - N-acetylglucosamine based chemotaxis for Bacillus subtilis - Double terminator
This part is designed to enable a N-acetylglucosamine  based chemotaxis in B. subtilis.
Design
The encoded protein is a chimera of two proteins:
- the methyl accepting Chemotaxis protein (McpA from B. subtilis which is required for taxis towards glucose.
- the N-acetylglucosamine regulated methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein from Vibrio cholerae (VCD).
The chimeric protein contains the intracellular domains of McpA from Bacillus subtilis to enable the transduction of the signal:  these domains correspond to the amino acids 1-37 and 282-610.  The extracellular domain of VCD is inserted between the intracellular regions of McpA  to sense N-acetylglucosamine and corresponds to the amino acids 31-310.

Binding
BBa_K1364005
Pveg - RBS consensus - Chitin Binding protein - Double terminator
This part is designed to enable the binding of Bacillus subtilis to the fungi wall made of chitin.
Design
This part is composed of a Cell Wall Binding (CWB) sequence  and a Chitin Binding Domain (CBD) linked with a 6 amino acids linker.
The CWB domain has been extracted from LytC ( BBa_K316030 ) of the iGEM 2010 Imperial College team.
The CBD is composed of the Domain 4 of the GbpA protein of Vibrio cholerae, a protein reported to mediate bacterial attachment to chitin.  It has been shown that the Domain 4 was essential to bind chitin.

PlepA - SpoVG RBS
PlepA is a constitutive promoter in Bacillus subtilis (BBa_K823002) coupled with a RBS spoVG (BBa_K143021). To get the highest level of translation from this Promoter-RBS combination it must be connected to a coding region preceded by a coding region prefix. A standard prefix will increase the distance between the RBS and the start codon, reducing translational efficiency.  This construction is also working with Escherichia coli and has been verified by sequencing.
