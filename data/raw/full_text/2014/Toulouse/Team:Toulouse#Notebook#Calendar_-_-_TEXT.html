December 2013 – January 2014: Team selection
- iGEM competition presentation and explanations
- Constitution of the team by interviewing different students from Université Toulouse III Paul Sabatier and INSA de Toulouse
The adventure begins for the 2014 Toulouse iGEM Team!
Collapse
January – June 2014: Projects brainstorming
- Thanks to weekly meetings, our team was able to discuss about new project ideas.
- Many ideas were approached and debated regarding the feasibility thanks to the literature and supervisors including teachers and researchers.
This is a list of the main projects:
- Let's save our trees with SubtiTree: the purpose is to use Bacillus subtilis as an optimized bacterium to target and bind to a specific fungus and secrete fungicides to destroy it.
- E. coli cancer: the concept was to create a bacterium able to colonize specifically the hypoxic regions of the tumor. The oxygen-sensitive bacterium would not be able to develop in the healthy zones.
- Reduction of ruminants’ methane production: the goal is to reduce the production of methane by ingesting a microorganism in the animals' rumen. This bacterium would be able to reduce the quantity of metabolic hydrogen and eliminate the methanogenic Archaes population.
Collapse
June 2014: Choice of SubtiTree project
The discussion has been long to estimate the practicability of our final project. By the end of May, most of the ideas were eliminated but two of them remained: controlling the cancer or saving the trees. It became easily clear that SubtiTree was successfully completed whether regarding the scientific part or the ethical aspect. Indeed, our knowledge in medicine was not sufficient enough to evaluate the consequences of a bacterium injection in the human body for E. coli cancer. Therefore, the whole team agreed on focusing on a local issue as the preservation of the Canal du Midi plane trees. However, the final goal was based on the idea to allow our optimized bacteria to be efficient for all fungi infections in the environment. By this period, we evaluated our budget to approximately €39,500.

- Organization of a weekly meeting each Friday with our supervisors to tackle any problem encountered
Weekly meeting with the instructors (06/20/2014)

Week 3 (30 June -6 July) and Week 4 (7-13 July)
Communication and financial support:
- Participation at the BioSynSys conferences: presentation of SubtiTree project
- We have put in place a newsletter system the first friday of each month to keep all our sponsors and people who support us updated about the project (financial, scientific and communication aspects).
Lab work:
- Design of all the constructions needed with cloning and restriction enzymes to save some time and allow a better comprehension of our bacterium system Problem: A problem was reported in the use of the CYP. Indeed, the BioBrick is not expressed properly in Bacillus subtilis strain. Therefore we had to look at the literature to find a new fungicide called GAFP-1.
- A bioreactor was conceived to reproduce the composition of the sap in the plane trees. The main goal was to identify the behavior of Bacillus strain in a medium composed of many different carbon sources.
- Competent cells and transformation practice using GFP and RFP.
Weekly meetings with the instructors (07/04/2014) and (07/11/2014)
- iGEM efficiency kit does not work, we shall not use it anymore
