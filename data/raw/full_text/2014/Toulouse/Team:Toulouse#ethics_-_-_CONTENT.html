&quot;Knowledge without conscience is but the ruin of the soul.&quot;
&quot;Science sans conscience, n'est que ruine de l'âme&quot;, François Rabelais, 16<SUP>th</SUP> century.
</P><P class="texte">The ethical
questioning turned out to be one of the major starting points of our project.
Acting on an established environment and modifying it is by no mean trivial and
our combined technical and philosophical points of view. The actual purpose of our project also leads us to undertake an
ethical questioning about the role of the scientist regarding “useless” things
such as the trees lining along the Canal du Midi. </P><P class="title1" id="select1">Protection of the beauty</P><P class="title2">Is it the scientists’ role to protect beauty?
</P><P class="texte"> Beauty is a
feeling of satisfaction and is selfless. It is more a feeling than the property
of a thing, this is not a notion we can clearly understand. Indeed, we can find
something beautiful even when we don’t know the purpose of the object...</P><CENTER><P class="legend">Figure 1: Fontaine (Marcel Duchamp). Yes this is also art...</P></CENTER><P class="texte">There is always
a distinction between natural beauty and artistic beauty according to Hegel,
a German philosopher. The artistic beauty is born from our mind and our
spirit: it is an element of signification of the work of art whereas the
natural beauty of the object is external. In a way, the Canal du Midi combines
both types of beauty: a natural one regarding the Nature, the centenary plane
trees but also an artistic one since the Canal was built by the human hands.
Usually, science judges beauty as a superficial feature not deserving to
undertake any kind of scientific efforts to maintain it. The traditional role
of science is to solve global issues and to elaborate complex strategies in
order to find useful solutions for everyone’s life. Once made this observation,
one may wonder why synthetic biology would be used only to protect the useless
beauty of a local heritage such as the trees lining the Canal du Midi. 
</P><P class="texte">
This crucial
interrogation leads us to consider science and synthetic biology from a
different point of view. <B>What if the role of scientists was also to make
people rediscovering the beauty of Nature? What if the bases of new scientific
challenges resulted from a more local scale? </B>Science does not have to be it has so much to gain opening itself to these
challenges. First scientifically, as research is never
useless and as we never know the impact and the scope of our results.
Then socially, as we could measure the deep interest raised by our
project within the population and the media. Adopting a new vision of synthetic
biology, we will probably make people change their mind about this innovative
discipline. 
The traditional cold objectivity of science distances itself from the society.
However, scientists are also being capable of feeling the beauty, sensitive to
the charm of landscapes and <B>able to understand the usefulness of
&quot;useless&quot; trees</B>…
The design of a strategy to protect useless beauty may seem senseless but we
believe that it is also the scientist’s duty. We have to remember that thinking
is what distinguish <I>Homo sapiens</I> from other species on earth and this
&quot;thinking&quot; feature allows us to understand the world and be conscious
of our human Nature (Descartes: <I>Cogito ergo sum</I>). The art is an object
of philosophical thought. Consciousness raises humans above all others living
creatures. Thus, it is necessary to respect and protect art. And thus, it
becomes essential to preserve the beauty of the Canal du Midi. 
</P><P class="title1" id="select2">Human intervention on  Nature</P><P class="texte">Our main question is to understand the complicated relationship between man and Nature.
Does mankind have the proper right to change the Nature? Is modified Nature considered as artificial?</P><P class="title2"> Mankind &amp; Nature</P><P class="texte"> Nature deserves
to be respected and loved. Mankind has always been linked to Nature as its
survival depends on what comes out of the ground, the trees, the oceans… The
Nature is a source of wealth for mankind. It ensures survival and development
by giving men the wood, the rocks, the soil to build shelters. Being in contact
with Nature can allow men to feel strong emotion, as describe by poets like
Hugo and Lamartine.</P><P class="texte">Since the birth
of humanity, man himself understood the importance of studying and mastering
Nature to develop the civilization. Still today the most advanced technologies
often try to mimic natural phenomena. With the development of civilization, men
modified their environment, changing it for their own comfort depending on
their own desire. With the increase of human activity, the natural environment
is modified profundly. With industrialization, the
natural environment suffered from waste discharges, oil slicks, intensive
fishing (and many others...) but also the introduction of devastating species
such as the pathogen,<I> Ceratocystis
platani</I>. However, despite these negative aspects, men
are capable of favorable actions to help the environment and fix their
mistakes. The current trend is to limit the impact of human interventions on
Nature, and hopefully this trend is not transient and will not vanish. A new
desire is born, a wish to protect Nature and wilderness. Humanity can adhere to
this position: human take advantage of the
environment and the environment takes advantage of the reasoned human
interventions. There is an adaptation of mankind to Nature. Moreover, humans
can have empathy: people are capable of understanding emotions and cognitive
states of other organisms. To respond to these feelings, humans have
technological tools allowing them to fight against enemies. This is the case
with our project: fighting <I>Ceratocystis
platani</I>. 
</P><P class="texte">In conclusion,
by destroying and hammering the Nature, we jeopardize our lives. We need
Nature, we come from Nature and we depend on Nature for survival, food,
discoveries and civilisation. Respecting, loving and
preserving the beauty of it is also a question of
survival.</P><P class="title2">Nature and artifice
</P><P class="texte">Talking about
the Nature refers to the whole world with an exception: all the transformations
made by mankind. Nature exists regardless of men and his interventions whereas
artificial is everything that exists because to humans.
</P><P class="texte">However,
pretending that natural and artificial are opposite does not seem to be true.
Man cannot create without the various elements provided by Nature, he then justs transform Nature. Thus we may wonder if there is a
true difference between natural and artificial. The border between these two
notions is not as obvious as it seems. The landscapes are shaped by the hand of
man, animals are domesticated, and now bacteria are considered as cell
factories. A natural reserve is artificially preserved as a result of human
actions. Is there still something natural since the birth of mankind? Actually,
the artifice is a slight modification of Nature and couldn’t exist by itself.
The distinction between natural and artificial seems sterile and we clearly
understand that these notions are inextricably linked and need each other to
exist. </P><P class="texte">In conclusion,
isn't it our duty to use our unique position in the history of life and our human
approach to try to replace the evolutive processes?</P><P class="title2">Back to our project</P><P class="texte">These
inextricable links are obviously the basis of our project. We aim to
artificially preserve a natural heritage shaped by Pierre Paul Riquet hundreds years ago. Fighting a
naturally occurring form of life that threatens it maybe just an imitation of
the natural evolution process. What is considered today as ‘non-natural’
may be one day regarded differently. To the extent that everything is done not
to unbalance the ecosystem, our intervention can be judged rightful, even more
than the use of chemicals.</P><P class="title1" id="select3">SubtiTree</P><P class="title2"> Potential strategies discussed
 (See more details in the <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Toulouse/Project/Spreading">Spreading</A> dedicated page)
</P><P class="texte">To be sure that
SubtiTree will not survive and spread in the
environment, many strategies were discussed to improve our bacterium: 

- Avoid the survival in the natural environment (outside the tree) thanks to a proline auxotrophy system 
- Prevent the sporulation of <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> to make it annual  
- Avoid gene transfers between SubtiTree and a wild
type bacterium thanks to a toxin-antitoxin system 
- Use an integrative plasmid to improve the genetic stability
</P><P class="title2">Public perception
</P><P class="title3">Political and public adhesion</P><P class="texte">Due to our
strong implication in preserving this magnificent work of art, our project
interested several governmental services. Indeed some municipalities and
regional councils supported our local engagement. Beyond that, our project
interests the highest level of the “Canal du Midi” administration: the national
navigation authority (VNF) and the Ministry of agriculture. Both of them funded
this project. They are now looking for the continuation of the project after
the iGEM competition. This is clearly a sign that we targeted the right
question. </P><P class="texte">This project
also received the attention of the public through several articles in
newspapers, television, radio and internet. First we had just a local coverage,
but days after days there were more and more media interested in SubtiTree. This mediatic coverage
allowed us to contact concerned citizens who participated to the development of
this project. This interaction with the public allowed us to explain and
promote public knowledge of synthetic biology. </P><P class="title3">Safety principle</P><P class="texte">One single tree
infected by Canker, and all the trees located in an area of a couple of hundred
meters around are included in the prophylactic cut. We acted to preserve the
surrounding trees. The modification of the endophytic
microbial fauna generated by the introduction of the engineered bacterium has
to be compared to the introduction of chemicals. They contain chlorine atom and
aromatic hydrocarbon, so their remediation is complicated and they represent a
source of pollution. By shortening the lifespan to one season and minimizing
the risks of spreading, we plan a safe and environmental-friendly way to fight
Canker.   


</P><P class="title2">Feasability
</P><P class="texte">We wonder about
the feasibility of tree’s treatment. As we used endophytic
bacteria, we can count on the natural growth of SubtiTree
inside the sap. So we can inject few bacteria to be sure to have enough
bacteria to protect the tree. Some researchers (Xianling
Ji<SUP>1</SUP> et al) already injected <I>B. subtilis</I> in plants and
observed an increase of bacteria concentration to a maximum of 10<SUP>5</SUP>
bacteria/mL</P><P class="texte">As we aim to
inject a small quantity of bacteria, this treatment remains cheaper than the
injection of several liters of chemical fungicides. In addition, this injection
prevents the preventive tree cutting, which is very expensive. Cutting one tree
cost around € 3000. The administration in charge of the protection of the
“Canal du Midi” already plans to spend 220 million euros to cut and replant all
trees along the Canal. Besides the important cost of cutting trees, it will
destroy one of the symbols of south-western France. </P><P class="texte">We know that SubtiTree could be improved in many ways, but in the 
iGEM’s circumstances we could not have the time to go
deeper. First, we can improve the fixation module. Using chitin as fixation
anchor is simple but not enough specific to fix just one fungus type. That’s
why we first think to fix SubtiTree to one protein
included in the <I>Ceratocystis
platani</I>’s
membrane: CP. The bacterial prototype designed this summer can be optimized to
trigger the fungicides production when the binding is completed, and to be more
specific changing the peptides produced.</P><P class="title1">References</P><LI class="tree"><P class="texte"> Xianling Ji, Guobing Lu, Yingping Gai, Chengchao Zheng,and Zhimei Mu.<B> Biological control against bacterialwilt and colonization of
