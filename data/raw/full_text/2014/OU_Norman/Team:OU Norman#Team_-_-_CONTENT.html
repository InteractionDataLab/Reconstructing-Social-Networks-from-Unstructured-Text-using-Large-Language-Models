She has previously served as the Assistant Captain and serves this year as the team Captain, working mainly to acquire funding for the team, oversee research planning, and overall team functioning. After studying abroad in Peru (where she plans to consume copious amounts of ceviche), she plans to attend graduate school to pursue a Ph.D. in the fields of molecular virology, infectious disease, and the human microbiome. Her interests outside of the lab include Latin dance, Latin American culture, and New Girl.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H1>Samuel Jones:  <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:OU_Norman/Project/Notebook/sam">Notebook</A></H1><TABLE width="90%" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="5" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD width="65%" align="left">Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, but quite near actually, a young man by the name of Samuel Jones was born. Through a series of trials, tribulations, and random flirtations, Samuel has progressed through a life that currently culminates in being engaged to the loves of his life, Science and his fiancée, Mandy. He is the head researcher on the iGEM team and the president of the local chapter of ASM. He hopes to marry Mandy soon and go to graduate school for virology while developing his interest in mycology as a hobby.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H1>Justin Montgomery: <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:OU_Norman/Project/Notebook/Main">Notebook</A></H1><TABLE width="90%" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="5" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD width="65%" align="left">I reside at the University of Oklahoma majoring in Neurobiology with a sub-focus in microbiology. This year being my senior year I’ve spent nearly a year and a half working alongside OU iGEM in the lab, aka my second home, where I have served as secretary. I recorded the main notebook. Outside of the academic setting, I appreciate a nice cup of coffee and a good Netflix marathon during the winter months. Recently I’ve gotten into wakeboarding at a local cable park. All in all my passion lies with the brain and its limitless ability to create great things and make the world just that much nicer.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H1>Meredith Thornton: <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:OU_Norman/Project/Notebook/meredith">Notebook</A></H1><TABLE width="90%" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="5" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD width="65%" align="left">Meredith Thornton is a senior in Microbiology with a minor in Chemistry. Her contributions to the iGEM team include primary lab work throughout the spring and summer and outreach coordination. She is interested in pursuing a master's degree in environmental microbiology with an emphasis in biocorrosion and bioremediation. She is also involved in the ASM student chapter at OU as the treasurer and a member of the OU women's rowing team for the past three years.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H1>Benjamin Hickerson: <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:OU_Norman/Project/Notebook/ben">Notebook</A></H1><TABLE width="90%" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="5" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD width="65%" align="left">My name is Benjamin Hickerson. I am a microbiology-major at the University of Oklahoma, and it is my fifth year. My involvement with the iGEM team at OU ranges from wet work, to public interaction.  So I do a lot of work in the lab, but I have also helped with outreach, and have been acting as the Treasurer of our organization. I certainly have an interest in genetic engineering. I almost feel like I am using really complex Legos to create something outside of the instruction manual. Though my eventual goal is to go into the health field.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H1>Zachariah Herron</H1><TABLE width="90%" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="5" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD width="65%" align="left">Zachariah is a Chemistry major attempting to finish out his degree. He has spent an inordinate amount of time crouched in front of analytical instruments, experiments, and computers. When he is not furthering his education, he is working or drowning himself in videos, manga, music, and books. Most of the time, it is several things at once. His role on this team has been media and wiki development. He also assists the others where necessary.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><H1 style="font-size:30px">Adviser</H1><DIV class="innerpocket"><H1>Dr. Boris Wawrik: <A href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/boris-wawrik/34/5b2/866">linkedin</A></H1><TABLE width="90%" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="5" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD width="65%" align="left">Dr. Wawrik is the current adviser of the team.
