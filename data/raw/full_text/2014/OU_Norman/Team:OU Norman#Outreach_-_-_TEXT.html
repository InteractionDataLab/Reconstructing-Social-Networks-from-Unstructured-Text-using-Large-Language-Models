The University of Oklahoma iGEM team is involved in educating the public about the applications of genetic engineering. Our goal is to bring awareness to the positive implications of synthetic biology and be a positive influence on our community. The following are some of the ways we have been involved.
Science Cafe
In June of 2014, we presented information to the local community about our team, our research, and iGEM. Our audience consisted of local teachers, students, professors, and elders of Norman, Oklahoma. They had plenty of questions for us at the end and we did our best to answer them. Some were unclear on what exactly happened in microbiology while others were curious about our start into the world of science. We hope to continue our involvement in the local community with the intent of fostering a high school team and enlightening them about the joys and hazards of science.
Macquarie iGEM Team: So You Think You Can Synthesize?
We received a notice from our friends down under about assisting in their outreach program. They desired to educate our fellow human beings in the practices of synthetic biology. We thought it was a great method and did our best to help out. We sent them the question: "What is the difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes?" Their response provided a stepping stone for future endeavours into educating our fellow man.
Linköping's Peanut Survey
At the beginning of the summer, we received a questionnaire from this team about peanut allergies. Many of us were unaware of how broad this condition was, but were glad to see an interest had been sparked in such a noble team. We responded to their survey as swiftly as possible. Hopefully, they reach a favorable end in their research.
