6/25/14 - 3A Assembly of promoters and ADH6
Past two attempts were not successful. Again, this time we will increase amount of  ADH6, to double it to 1.2ul. Additionally, in the ligation step we add the PCR water,  buffer, 3 parts and lastly the T4 Ligase.
Before beginning: Preheat the heat block and heat bath Cross link PCR water Have Tetracycline plates Psi broth Ice block Retrieve enzymes from freezer: EcoR1, Spe1, Xba1, Pst1 Primers BSA

7/17/14 – Media prep with Promoter, Adh6 in PsB1T3 in 2XYT media
We have had difficulty with the efficacy of our promoters (23B, 20A, 20E). To try and increase our yield we will attempt to increase the cell mass by growing the cells in an Erlenmeyer flask with a rubber stopper inside, a foam stopper and foil to cover.
-Add 75ul of 2XYT broth to a 250ml Erlenmeyer flask (this amount helps maintain aerobic environment within the broth and prevents it from boiling over in the autoclave) -Autoclave -Add cells (either 20A or 20E) -Allow to incubate over night in 37C with 200-300rpm shaking -Extract DNA (tomorrow)
7/18/14 – DNA Extraction of Promoters (23B, 20A, 20E) with Adh6
23B#3 made via 3A Assembly with Adh6 on 7/17/14

Results were insufficient: 20A#15 + Adh6 + PsB1T3 = 8.5 ng/ul 20E#11 + Adh6 + PsB1T3 = 16.7 ng/ul
7/18/14 – Colony PCR of KIVD, promoters and Adh6
Performed on KIVD + 4P or 6D and promoters (23B, 20A, 20E), and Adh6
30ul per reaction : 30ul x 30 reactions = 900ul total
Calculate total for extra 3 reactions just in case -450ul master mix -2ul Forward primer -2ul Reverse primer -446ul PCR water (total to 900ul) Total = 900ul
PCR set up: -5min at 94C 30 sec at 94C 1 min at 51C 3 min at 72C 10 min at 72C Store at 4C
7/21/14 – Gel of PCR Products from 7/18/14
-Objective of the gel is to visualize which colonies contained the desired plasmid from previous 3A assemblies.
Materials: Agarose, 1x TAE buffer, Gel mold with electrodes, PCR product
1% gel: 0.4g agarose with 40ml of TAE Buffer = larger gel double amounts -Combine in Erlenmeyer flask -Microwave until clear, no chunks -Pour into gel mold and allow to cool -Voltage – small gel = 85 volts, large gel = 115 volts
In gel: -in first well, load 5ul of KB ladder -3ul dye in each sample well -5ul DNA in each sample well
After gel ran, most of the DNA appeared to remain in the wells, even after running under higher voltage. Ultimately, there were no visible bands for promoters + Adh6. There was evidence for bands for KIVD + terminators.
7/23/14 – Transformation of P#1 and P#2 into DH5α with PIKM1
-Using previously assembled plasmid #1 (Ori + Pptb- +MLSR + 4P + PsB1C3) and Plasmid #2 (Ori + Pptb- +MLSR + 6D + PsB1C3) and DH5α with PIKM1 (methylating E.coli) to transform.
-Protocol: -4ul of ligation product (P1#4 or P2#2) into 100ul of competent E. coli methylating strain cells, located in -80C freezer. -Ice for 30 mins -Heat shock for 1 min at 42C -Ice for 5 mins -Add 600ul of Psi Broth to tubes -Incubate at 37C for 2 hours with 200rpm shaking -Plate on Chloramphenicol/Kanamycin plates -Allow to incubate for 24-48hours at 37C
Not successful, no colonies formed after 72 hours.
