Tetracycline Hydrochloride
480.9 g/mol
Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis Blocks ribosomal binding of aminoacetal-Trna
PROCEDURE FOR PREPARATION
Obtain (3) 15 mL test tubes
Obtain (1) 50 mL test tube
Obtain 0.250 g of tetracycline
Place in the 50 mL test tube
Add EtOH to the 50 mL mark
Shake to dissolve completely
Use 100% EtOH
Because the tetracycline did not dissolve, we removed 15 mL of the solution and added 15 mL of water to catalyze the reaction
Next time we will use 35 mL of EtOH and 15 mL of water
Pour 15 mL of the solution into each of the 15 mL test tubes
Mark the test tubes in blue to identify tetracycline
PROCEDURE FOR BROTH AND PLATES
Add 500 μL of the tetracycline antibiotic twice to the broth using an Eppendorf pipette
Make sure the broth is cool before adding the antibiotic
Pour the broth into 25 plates
Allow the plates to cool before stacking them
While the plates are cooling, place a second broth container on the spin plate
Temperature = 150°C
Rotation = 1000
Once the plates have cooled mark them in blue (to identify as tetracycline), put them back in the sleeve, and store in the 5th floor refrigerator

PROCEDURE
Cross link water for 30 seconds
Use DI water
Take cap off of DI water when in spectrolinker
Add appropriate amount of water for each of the four centrifuges (1.5 mL)
Remember to keep the caps of the centrifuges on until they are in action
Stick the pipette all the way down to the bottom of the centrifuge to ensure complete utilization of water
Add buffer
Add appropriate amounts of DNA
Add restriction enzymes
Spin the samples to briefly collect all of the mixture
Incubate the restriction digests at 80°C for 15 minutes
Use a thermal cycler with a heated lid
Cool on the bench for ~5 minutes
Rescue of BBa K542003
DNA Sample = 2M on plate 1 Plasmid = pSC1C3
pBAD Regulated TetR Production of TetR is regulated by the pBAD promoter. TetR is an inhibitor of the constitutively “on” promoter pTet-BBa_R0040. Therefore, this part may be used in conjunction with the pTet promoter of an “inverter”; pTet will be “turned off” in the presence of arabinose. PROCEDURE
Turn on heat bath to 42°C
Obtain 10 μL of nuclease free PCR water
Mix into cell 2 M of the titer plate
Set for 5 minutes
Put the mixture into the PCR tube
Nanodrop
Obtain 2 μL of DI water
Clean the lens with a kim wipe
Drop the 2 μL of DI water on the aperature of the nanodrop to blank
Repeat with a re-blank
Drop 2 μL of the mixture on the nanodrop
Measure on the nanodrop
Save as well 2M Plate 1 sp20
Hit measure
Bacterial Transformation of BBa_K542003
Purpose Introduce a foreign plasmid into bacteria and to use those bacteria to amplify the plasmid in order to make large quantities of the plasmid. This is based on the natural function of a plasmid: to transfer genetic information vital to the survival of the bacteria. The efficiency of the protocol is HIGHLY dependent on timing. Conversions 100 ng of BBa_K542003 x 1 μL / 61.6 ng = 1.62 μL of gene PROCEDURE
Start thawing competent cells (E. coli top 10) on ice
Competent cells are in the -80°C freezer
Add 100 μL of competent cells into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
Add 100 ng of DNA to the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes
Heat shock cells in water bath for EXACTLY one minute
Make sure the water level is high energy for the tube to float
Adjust the temperature to 42°C
Incubate on ice for five minutes
Add 600 μL of psi broth to each centrifuge tube
Psi broth is in the -4°C freezer
Incubate centrifuge tubes in shaking incubator at 37°C at 200 rpm for two hours
Make three dilutions:
Obtain two fresh centrifuge tubes and label them with the appropriate dilution
1:10
1:100
1:1000
Add 90 μL of psi broth to each centrifuge tube BEFORE diluting
Add 10 μL of transformed cells to the 1:10 dilution
Mix the solutions by pipetting up and down multiple times
Take 10 μL from the 1:10 solution and place it in the 1:100 dilution
Repeat for the 1:1000 solution
Competent Cells Protocol
The goal of this protocol is to make E. coli competent meaning the cells can uptake plasmids. We do this chemically. The strain of E. coli should not contain any plasmids which is why the strain we used was TOP10. How we obtained TOP10 was through Doc. He has access to the freezer stocks of all the organisms in the microbiology department.  For future reference when you ask for a specific strain you need an LB plate and a sterile inoculating stick. From there, Doc will do an EI (environmental isolate) streak. This plate needs to incubate at 37°C overnight. The next day you should do a quadrant streak in order to isolate colony forming units (CFU) and incubate the second culture overnight in the 37°C incubator to grow the CFU into a well-established culture for later use. We take CFU’s because it ensures us there is no contamination or other DNA present.  It’s important to note that you want your colonies to be fresh.
In the future, the competent cells will be used to transform plasmids into E. coli. The reason for this is that the organisms we use are anaerobic. Therefore, E. coli (aerobe) is our work horse in which we use it to grow up our plasmids and makes the research easier without accounting for the difficulties that come with working with anaerobic cells.
Tip: Walk yourself through the protocol as if you were doing it. Have a teammate present and discuss each to step to ensure you have an understanding of how and why this protocol is done (we don’t do things without a purpose in the lab otherwise we are wasting our time). Prepare all the materials needed beforehand and collaborate with relevant persons to ensure lab tools will be accessible. If you are prepared then the results should be in your favor. Worst comes to show you will have precise details of your experiments and will easily be able to pinpoint mistakes that need to be fixed.
Materials:
Sterilized Items
1 test tube
1 side-arm flask
Media and Buffers
TFB1
TFB2
LB Liquid (>200 mL)
2 LB plates
Spectrometer
Bunsen Burner
Inoculating Loop
Shaking incubator availability
You need specific temperature and rpm’s
Green Bucket with ice
Should be ready when needed. Don’t interrupt your experiment to get ice
Pipette + Tips
Syringe (3 mL) + needle
Nitrile gloves
Box to store finish products in freezer
Culture E. coli (no plasmid)
Obtain from Doc as noted above
Stocks are in -80°C Freezer
Use syringe + needle to remove approximately 25 microliters and spread onto LB plate
Isolate a CFU
Fill a test tube with 10 mL of LB broth
Test tubes must be sterilized via autoclave
Inoculate test tube with a CFU
Do this step at about 5pm because when you check the OD (optical density) the next day, you don’t want the OD to be too high which can indicate the cells have entered a different phase in cell development.
Place inoculated test tube in shaking incubator (200 rpm; 37°C) overnight
Make sure it’s on the shaking platform, NOT the top stagnate shelf.
Take sterilized side-arm flask; fill it with 100 mL of LB broth and then inoculate it with 1 mL of culture (inoculated test tube in shaking incubator)
Be sure to pre-warm LB broth (place in incubator for 30 minutes or set out on bench) because the temperature shock may negatively impact the E. coli.
Use sterile techniques to transfer LB liquid to flask. Use syringe to top it off for accuracy
Place side-arm flask in shaking incubator (37°C; 200 rpm) for two hours
Label 30 centrifuge tubes
Include
Date
Your initials
Competent E. coli TOP 10 (assuming that is the strain)
Measure OD (440)
Absorbance should be at 0.5; keep incubating and checking until desired absorbance is obtained
DON’T let the absorbance exceed 0.55
To measure the OD, place the side-arm of the flask into the spectrometer slot
USE para film to keep the top covered and prevent spillage
Be sure the liquid is exposed to the side of the para film that is not exposed to the environment in order to prevent contamination
