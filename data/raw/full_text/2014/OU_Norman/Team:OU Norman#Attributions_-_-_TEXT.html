People of Note
We would like to express our gratitude to several individuals who have been a most precious influence on our team.
The first is to our adviser, Dr. Boris Wawrik, for teaching us and giving us the feedback we needed as well as giving us the initial idea of expanding into anaerobes.
We would also like to thank Dr. Ralph Tanner (for C. acetobutylicum knowledge and a strain), Michael Upkong (for pikM1 and pAN1), and Tao Xu (for a C. cellulolyticum strain) for providing parts and information to get the team rolling.
Vickie McIlvoy provided a tremendous financial contribution to the team and we would like to extend our gratitude to her as well.
Finally, we would like to thank Jeremiah Miller for all his efforts in building and shaping the team.
