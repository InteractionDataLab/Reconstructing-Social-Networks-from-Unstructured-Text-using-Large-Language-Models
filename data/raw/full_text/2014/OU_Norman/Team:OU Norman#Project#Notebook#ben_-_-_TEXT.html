-Tubes were then placed in heat bath for 45 minutes at 42˚C. -Enzymes were then heat killed on heat block for 15 minutes at 80˚C.
Ligation of ter + Terminators (3A) 5/14/14
-The ligations were preformed with these specifications.
4 μL of upstream part
4 μL of downstream part
4 μL of destination backbone
4 μL of 10x T4 ligase buffer
1 μL of T4 ligase
22 μL of PCR water
-The tubes were then incubated on the bench top for 20 minutes. -2 sets of ligations were made for ter + 4P and ter + 6D.
Transformation of ter + Terminators (3A) 5/14/14
- 4 μL of ligation product was then added into 100 μL of competent cells for each transformation. - Cells were then put on ice for 30 minutes. - Cells were then heatshocked in a waterbath for 60 seconds at 42˚C. - Cells were then placed back on ice for 5 minutes. - 600 μL of PSI broth were then added to each tube. - Then the tubes were incubated at 37˚C for 2 hours, at 200 rpms. - Contents were then plated using 1:1 and 1:10 dilutions in PSI broth.
5/15/14
Libraries were made for ter + 4P and ter + 6D colonies.
5/20/14
Two lawns were made for each ter + 4P and ter + 6D.
5/22/14
AquaPlasmid DNA extraction was performed via Aquaplasmid's advised protocol.

Colony PCR 07/15/14
One centrifuge tube was loaded with:
Master Mix- 450 μL
Forward Primer- 2 μL
Reverse Primer- 2 μL
