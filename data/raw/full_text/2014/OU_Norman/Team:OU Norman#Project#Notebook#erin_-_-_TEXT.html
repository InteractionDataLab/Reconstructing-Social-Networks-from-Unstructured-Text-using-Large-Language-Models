4/10/14 3A Assembly of mlsR and ter
Calculations of DNA to use:
500 ng (upstream part) x 470.6 ng/ μl = 1.06 = 1 μl mlsR #24
500 ng ter 6d#16 (downstream part) x 194.2 ng/ μl = 2.57= 2.5 μl ter 6d#16
500 ng ter 4p #10 (downstream part) x 299.8 ng/ ul= 1.67 = 2 μl ter 4p #10
500 ng pSB1K3 x 175.2 ng/ μl = 2.85= 3 μl pSB1K3

Total reaction volume was 40μl Reactions were incubated on bench top for 20min Transformation
4μl of  ligation was added to 100 μl aliquot of TOP10 competent cells (x5)
Reaction kept on ice for 30 min
Reaction heat shocked in 42°C water bath for 60 sec
Reaction put on ice for 5 min
600 μl Psi broth added to each reaction
Tubes incubated with shaking at 200 rpm for 2 hours at 37°C
Undiluted (1:1) cells were plated (70 μl)
1:10 dilution was made with remainder of cells (10 μl transformation with 90 μl Psi) and all 100 μl was plated onto plates with kanamycin
Plates incubated at 37°C overnight
7/17/14-7/18/14 Competent cells (E. coli DH5α with pIKM1)
7/17: 10 ml LB 2X YT inoculated with single colony ~3pm 7/18: Competent cell protocol started ~11pm, Used 1ml cells instead of 1.5 ml
7/21/14-7/26/14 Transformation of E. coli DH5α PIKM1 with P1#4 and P2#2
P1(Ori + pPtb- + mlsR + 4p + pSB1C3) = 210.1ng/ μl P2 (Ori + pPtb- + mlsR + 6d + pSB1C3) = 198.8 ng/ μl 7/21:
100 μl of competent cells (E. coli DH5α pIKM1) plus 2.5 μl (~500ng) plasmid
Reaction kept on ice for 30 min
Reaction heat shocked in 42°C water bath for 60 sec
Reaction put on ice for 5 min
600 μl Psi broth added to each reaction
Tubes incubated with shaking at 200 rpm for 2 hours at 37°C
Undiluted (1:1) cells were plated (50 μl )
Plates (LB 2xYT + Chloramphenicol) incubated at 37°C overnight
7/22-26: No colonies Are the competent cells good? Need a new protocol for cell to accommodate 2 plasmids? Try electrotransformation?
7/29/14 Electrotransformation of E. coli DH5α pIKM1 with P1#4 and P2#2
Preparation of electrocompetent DH5α pIKM1 cells:
Grew up overnight of E. coli DH5α pIKM1 from single colony in ~30 mL of LB 2x YT at 200 rpm and 37°C
Brought LB 2xYT closer to room temp
Made 1ml overnight into 100mL fresh LB 2xYT dilution
Incubated at 37°C with 200 rpm until OD 0.5 was reached
1.5 ml culture aliquoted into each of 10 tubes
Tubes spun at 14000 rpm for 8 min
Supernatant removed
REALIZED THAT CELLS WERE GROWN OVERNIGHTIN LB + SALT AND NEED TO BE GROWN IN LB-SALT FOR ELECTROPORATION-EXPREIMENT STOPPED
8/1/14 Wrong Plasmid
It turns out that Dr. Wawrik gave us E. coli containing the wrong plasmid. It should be E. coli DH5α pAN1.
E. coli DH5α pAN1 was streaked out onto a LB+chloramphenicol plate for overnight growth at 37°C.
This still does not address the question of why our transformation did not work. Streaked competent cells make on 7/18 onto LB +kanamycin plate and LB without antibiotics plate to see if compent pIKM1 cells made still have pIKM1 plasmid (and thus chloramphenicol resistance) and are viable to determine if need different chemical competent cell protocol.
8/3/14 Viability of Competent Cells
Chemically competent cells plated on LB 2xYT and LB 2xYT + Kanamycin both grew significantly, suggesting that our competent cell protocol maintained cell viability and didn’t kick the pIKM1 plasmid out. Perhaps the protocol was just done wrong, fresh media needs to be used, or a protocol needs to be adapted to allow the cell to accommodate 2 plasmids. Electrotransformation will be attempted.
8/4/14 Electrotransformation of E. coli DH5α pAN1 with P1#4 and P2#2
Preparation of electrocompetent DH5α pIKM1 cells:
Started overnight culture in saltless LB 2xYT at 9:08pm on 8/3/14
25 mL 2xYT
Colonies were really close together
Made dilution
1.25 mL overnight into 50mL saltless 2xYT (x2)
Incubated 2 bottles of dilutions at 37°C with 200 rpm until  ~OD 0.5 was reached
Bottle 1 OD .66
Bottle 2 OD .59
Bottles transferred to ice to chill
15 1mL tubes from each bottle were prepared
Tubes spun at 14,000 rpm for 8min
Supernatant removed
Resusupended in 500 ul cold  ~90% glycerol
Glycerol was prepared incorrectly
Spun 14000 rpm for 3 min
Removed supernatant
Resuspended in 200ul cold 10% glycerol
Spun 14000 rpm 3 min
Removed supernatant
Resuspended in 100μl 10% cold glycerol
Put cells in -80°C armor beads to freeze
Stored in -80°C
Electrotransformation (E. coli DH5α pIKM1 with P1 and P2)
Combine in separate cuvettes:
2.5 ul P1 + 100ul cells (bottle 1) P1 #1
2.5 ul P1 + 100 ul cells (bottle 2) P1 #2
2.5 ul P2 + 100 ul cells (bottle 1) P2 #1
2.5 ul P2 + 100 ul cells (bottle 2) P2 #2
Let sit 5 min
Set electroporator to 2500V
Dumped Cell/plasmid mixture into special elctroporator cuvette
Hit run
Took out of electroporator, immediately pipetted in 600ul of Psi broth, and placed on ice.
Took from cuvette, placed in tube, incubated at 37°C with 200 rpm for 2 hours.

8/5/14 Results Electrotransformation E. coli DH5α pAN1 with P1#4 and P2#2
Colonies grew on plates Libraries made by Sam Not sure if both plasmids there because both have chloramphenicol resistance. Should grow on erythromycin plates, but not sure if will work since mlsR is behind Gram positive promoter. Clolony PCR will be performed to test for presence of plasmid. Gel will be run to see if both of our plasmids are there.

Dye
Appear to have light bands in some of the wells on the top portion of the large gel, however, these bands don’t correspond to the size of either plasmid. In preparing the gel, some dye without florescent agent was used by accident, so there is possibility that plasmid is there, we just can’t visualize it.
