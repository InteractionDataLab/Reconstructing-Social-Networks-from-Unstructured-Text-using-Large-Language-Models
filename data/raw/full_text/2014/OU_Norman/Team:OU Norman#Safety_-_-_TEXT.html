The Team Safety Requirements
We require each member of the experimental team to take two quizzes provided at our university. The first is a general safety and hazard communication quiz. The second is a lab safety quiz. These two set up the initial groundwork for keeping our team members safe. Each member is required to know the location of all safety equipment in the lab and what to do in case of emergencies. As a ride along, we are also examined by the local safety officer whenever he comes to check the other labs with whom we share our space. Hazards are ubiquitous, but our lab members are trained to be careful and alert at all times. We even have a policy for mistakes in the lab. If three mistakes are made in one day, the lab member should go home and try again tomorrow. After all, it is better to be safe than sorry.
Our Lab
At the current moment, we have been relegated to a single corner in a teaching lab at our university. While it isn't much, we can still call it home. Over the course of existence, we have managed to pull together the beginnings of a lab. As can be seen above, we try to keep everything organized. Our lab spaces are kept as sterile as possible too.
The most worthwhile things have to start somewhere.
