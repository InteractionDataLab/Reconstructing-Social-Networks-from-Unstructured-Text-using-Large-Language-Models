Financing and Intellectual Property
In view of the possible BaKillus application process, we first plan to focus on the development of the diagnostic tool inside the university. Funding might be possible through the DFG (Deutsche Forschungs Gemeinschaft, "German Research Foundation") or SynBio- or entrepreneurship-funding organizations. Once our idea is able to leave the lab, we would start a company and develop a prototype with the help of an industry partner (e.g. a small engineering company) and venture capital funds. Alternatively, we would look into the possibility of acquiring the necessary financial means through a crowdfunding campaign.  At the same time, intellectual property (e.g. patents) would be built up to protect our invention and provide an income for the growth of our start-up. Through the success of our diagnostic tool, we could convince further investors and finally be able to afford the approval process of the BaKillus nasal spray. Once we have brought this product to the market, we have a precendence for new legal regulations regarding the approval of microbial GMOs and SynBio products.

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.
See you!
So now you know my short story - and it is time for me to return to my fight for a safer world. Feel free to take a closer look on my super powers , the process of my development or the plans for a medical application .
