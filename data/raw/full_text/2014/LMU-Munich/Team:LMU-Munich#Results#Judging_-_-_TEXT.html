Judging
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
  ✓
 
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2014 Judging form.
  ✓
 
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
  ✓
 
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
  ✓
 
The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
  ✓
Link to page on your team's wiki:
https://2014.igem.org/Team:LMU-Munich/Team/Attributions
 
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. Please see the Registry help page on adding new parts. A new application and/or outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part's/ Device's function) of a previously existing BioBrick part also counts. Please see the Registry help page on how to document your contributions. To fulfill this criteria, you will also need to submit the part with its original part name to the Registry, following the submission guidelines.
  ✓
Part Number(s): BBa_K1351017
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. Part Number: BBa_K1351017
  ✓
 
Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry.
  ✓
 
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines)
  ✓
Part Number: BBa_K1351017
 
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.
  ✓

Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal:
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part.
  ✓
Part Number(s): BBa_K1351021 BBa_K1351024 BBa_K1351040
 
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.

GEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team's scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.
See you!
So now you know my short story - and it is time for me to return to my fight for a safer world. Feel free to take a closer look on my super powers , the process of my development or the plans for a medical application .
