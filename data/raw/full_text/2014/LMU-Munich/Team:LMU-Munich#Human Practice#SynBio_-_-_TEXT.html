SynBio Day

This year we had the great possibility to spread the idea of Synthetic Biology and present our project to the public in cooperation with the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Inspired by the idea of iGEM, the Deutsches Museum inivted us to their "Zentrum Neue Technologien" (Center for New Technologies) where visitors were able to do their own DNA extraction out of vegetables with household products as one our main atractions.  Additionally we discussed the highly disputed thematics of modifying organisms genetically and tried to get an impression of the current public opinion. In doing so we quickly realized, that most people have not heard of Synthetic Biology before. This coincides with the statement of PD Dr. Alexander Bogner made during our Panel Discussion . However people were interested in the possibilities synthetic biology promises in terms of providing better health care and sustainable alternative resources.
We would like to thank the Deutsches Museum for this great opportunity.

Here we hand you our explanatory materials we used to educate the visitors of the Deutsches Museum about SynBio. If you feel like you have material that should be added to that list please inform us via eMail about it and we will implement it.

Hi there!
Welcome to our Wiki! I'm BaKillus, the pathogen-hunting microbe, and I'll guide you on this tour through our project. If you want to learn more about a specific step, you can simply close the tour and come back to it anytime you like. So let's start!
What's the problem?
First of all, what am I doing here? The problem is, pathogenic bacteria all around the world are becoming more and more  resistant against antimicrobial drugs. One major reason for the trend is the inappropriate use of drugs. With my BaKillus super powers, I want to reduce this misuse and thus do my part to save global health.
Sensing of pathogens
To combat the pathogenic bacteria, I simply eavesdrop on their communication. Bacteria talk with each other via quorum sensing systems, which I use to detect them and trigger my responses.
Adhesion
The more specific and effective I can use my powers, the lower the danger is of provoking new resistance development. So I catch pathogens whenever I get hold of them and stick to them until my work is done.
Killing
Talking about my work - killing pathogens is finally what I am made for. In response to quorum sensing molecules of the pathogens, I export a range of antimicrobial substances leading to dissipation of biofilms and the killing of the targeted bacteria.
Suicide switch
When the job is done and all the bad guys are finished, you don't need a super hero anymore. So after fulfilling my work I say goodbye to the world by activating my suicide switch.
Application
Of course I'm not only a fictional hero, but a very real one. In two different prototypes, I could be used for diagnosis or treatment of pathogen-caused diseases. However, there is still a whole lot of regulational and economical questions that have to be answered before.
See you!
So now you know my short story - and it is time for me to return to my fight for a safer world. Feel free to take a closer look on my super powers , the process of my development or the plans for a medical application .
