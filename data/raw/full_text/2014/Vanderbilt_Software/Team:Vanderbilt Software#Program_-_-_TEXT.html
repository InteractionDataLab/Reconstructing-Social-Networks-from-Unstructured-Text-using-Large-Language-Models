Program Description
User Guide and API Reference
The program produced by Vanderbilt's 2014 iGEM software team is named darwin, a Unix command-line tool to produce what are known as "diffs" between two genomic data files. The command to produce the diff is dwndiff, typically invoked by using:
dwndiff <file1> <file2>
This creates a file with the extension .vcscmp which can be used in typical version control systems.
The current version of the project can be found on the project's github page .
