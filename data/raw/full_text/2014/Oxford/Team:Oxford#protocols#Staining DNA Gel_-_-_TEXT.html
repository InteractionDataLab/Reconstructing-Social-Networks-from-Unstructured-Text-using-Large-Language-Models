Staining DNA Gel
↩ Back to other protocols .
Lift DNA gel tray out of 1/2 x TBE filled tank. Secure the gel with finger tips at the end of the tray and drain off the buffer.
CAUTION – ETHIDIUM BROMIDE IS CARCINOGENIC, ALWAYS WEAR GLOVES!
Carefully place in the gel in the ethidium bromide tray and replace lid. Turn on the shaker tray underneath. Rinse the gel tray.
NOTE: Lower the gel close to the surface of the ethidium bromide and let it slide off the tray to minimise splash.
Leave for 20-30 minutes.
Remove the gel from the ethidium bromide using the large spatulas next to the tray. Drain off any excess ethidium bromide.
Carry the gel through to Transluminator, place inside and close the door.  Zoom controlled by the computer and focus wheel manually adjusted at top of instrument.
NOTE: Try not to open the door to the instrument room with a gloved hand that is contaminated with ethidium bromide. Use the same hand to touch the gel and the other to use the computer. The computer is also contaminated with ethidium bromide so do not remove gloves to operate.
Take picture and save in iGEM file.
Remove gel from Transluminator and wipe the instrument surface clean.
NOTE: If disposing of gel now, put in marked disposal bin by staining tray.
