Electroporation of Pseudomonas putida or Pseudomonas fluorescens
↩ Back to other protocols .
Keep everything on ice throughout the entire procedure. Prechill cuvettes on ice.
Transfer 6mL of an overnight culture into a Falcon tube. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes and remove the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in 4mL sterile, 1mM HEPES solution (containig 10% glycerol by volume) and Centrifuge again for 5 minutes at 2000 rpm.
Discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 4mL HEPES (with 10% glycerol) and repeat the centrifugation.
Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 400 uL HEPES (10 % glycerol). Store this on ice until use.
Add the DNA and transfer to an ice-cold cuvette.
Electroporate with a BIO-RAD electroporator. Make sure the time constant is equal to or greater than 4.
Immidiately mix the cells with 1mL SOC and transfer to a prechilled Eppendorf tube. Shake at 20°C for 2 hours.
Plate #1: Plate 100 uL on selective medium at a 1:10 dilution.
Plate #2: Spin the remainder at full speed for one minute, remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100mL of SOC and plate on a selective medium.
