Reviving Freeze-Dried Cultures
↩ Back to other protocols .
Remove the freeze-dried strain from the cold room.
In the lamina flow hood, cut the top of the seal of the ampoule off with scissors.
Pipette 0.5 mL of the appropriate growth medium into the ampoule and mix by pipetting up and down, being careful to avoid frothing.
Leave on the bench for 40 minutes to resuspend.
