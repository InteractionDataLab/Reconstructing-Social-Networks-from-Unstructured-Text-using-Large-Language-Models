4 Matthew Booth
Engineers
Matt, Oliver and Leroy will be responsible for the mathematical modelling, software designing and realising any practical desires.
Oliver Vince
Ollie is our keenest team member - nothing can stop his motivation. As well as being in charge of the maths and software, he feels responsible for our entertainment, and makes sure to keep us laughing (whether with or at him).
Leroy Lim
Leroy is a second year Engineering, Economics and Management student at St John's College. During term, he spends his time trying, but generally failing, to balance the three R's of Oxford- rowing, 'rithmetic and rowing. During iGEM, he's our engineer and self-appointed social sec.
Matthew Booth
Matt has just completed the second year of his engineering course at St John's College. He's lived in England all of his life and has played rugby, the only real sport, for as long as he can remember (when he isn't busy engineering...)
