Agar Plate Preparation
↩ Back to other protocols .
Put the agar (in a duran bottle) in the microwave on the ‘defrost’ setting for 20-30 minutes  with the lid slightly unscrewed
Once there are no lumps in the agar, cool down in a 55 oC water bath (or, if needed quickly, under a cool tap, whilst swirling to avoid it setting.)
Add antibiotics as required to the duran bottle.
Label the bottom of the plates to be used.
Line the plates up at the back of the lamina flow hood. Take the lids of leaving them resting on the side of the plates. Fill the plates with the agar.
Allow the agar to set.
