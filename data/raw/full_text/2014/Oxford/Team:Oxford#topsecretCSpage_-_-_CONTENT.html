They have a huge range of uses by individuals, professionals, and industry.
The chlorinated solvent methylene chloride (also known as dichloromethane or DCM) has been used in industry for over 80 years. Its unique combination of properties - low boiling point, high solvency power, relative inertness, low toxicity and non flammability - has led to its wide variety of applications. It is the most widely-used of the chlorinated solvents, particularly for pharmaceutical production, and is as well used as an extraction medium/process solvent.(Eurochlor). For these reasons, our team has chosen to use DCM as the case study chemical for which we will develop a bioremedication mechanism eventually applicable to all chlorinated solvents. 
Who produces chlorinated solvent waste, and why? Eurochlor, the EU body responsible for the European Chlorinated Solvents Association) analyses the uses and impact of chlorinated solvents in three categories: industrial, professional, and consumer. Today the four most commonly used chlorinated solvents are dichloromethane (DCM - also known as methyl chloride [CH2Cl2]), trichloroethylene (aka trichloroethene [C2HCl3]), perchloroethylene (aka tetrachloroethene [C2Cl4]), and to a lesser extent, trichloromethane(aka chloroform[CHCl3]).
