Nanodrop: Finding DNA Concentration
↩ Back to other protocols .
Ensure the program is selected to read “NUCLEIC ACID” where it says “Sample Type” (Top right of screen)
Load 2 µl of your blank onto the raised pedestal. (NOTE: this blank should be the solvent your DNA/RNA is suspended in. For example this could be EB buffer if you have just done a MiniPrep)
Lower the metal lever until it gently rests on the sample pedestal and click ‘BLANK’ to zero the spectrophotometer reading.
Using a tissue blot off the liquid from the pedestal and the contact on the underside of the lever.
Now load 2µl of your nucleic acid sample in the same manner as the blank and close the lever
Click ‘MEASURE’. After a short while it will display a concentration in ng/µl in the bottom right hand corner.
Also displayed is the UV/Vis spectrum. One should expect a clean ‘bell’-like curve that indicated a clean sample. If a rough and wavy spectrum is seen the sample is likely contaminated.
Blot off the sample from the contacts as before and repeat for other samples.
At the end of your use wash the contacts by adding 2µl water to the contacts and closing the lever a few times before blotting off the water to leave the machine dry.
