Team:Oxford/team
From 2014.igem.org
Team
Glen Gowers
(3rd year Biochemist, University College)
The guy who makes everything happen, the Fred to our iGEM "Mystery Machine". When Glen isn't sailing around the country, he's hard at work in the lab and at the desk.
Glen's LinkedIn profile
Jack Hoffman
(3rd year Chemist, St John's College)
Though prodigious in his own field, Jack’s curiosity and fervour for a wide range of academic disciplines has allowed him to contribute to the team effort many different aspects. In particular, his design and synthesis of biopolymer capsules is not only a major contribution to the realisation of our project, but represents a novel bacterial containment system applicable to many fields of research. He is in charge of the realisation aspect of our project and has been working closely with our engineers to design mathematical frameworks for our modelling. Furthermore,  he has led our web page development and graphics.
Corinna Oswald
(3rd year Biochemist, St John's College)
Corinna is one of the founding members that organised Oxford’s first participation in iGEM, and was a key player in conceptualising our project 'DCMation'.
In between perfecting the Viennese Waltz and denying that Austrians are always yodeling in the Alps (which we refuse to accept), she works reliably hard and efficient to ensure that both her and the entire team's work is completed to the highest standards. Her organisational and communication skills secure the smooth running of the project despite ever-increasing time pressure and the broadly interdisciplinary nature of our team.

Andy Russell
(3rd year Biochemist, The Queen's College)
Andy is one of the founding members of Oxford’s first iGEM team. As well as having an avid interest in synthetic biology he has also worked in the field of cancer research. Andy is now entering his third year as a biochemist at The Queen's College, where he is an accomplished sportsman.
Contact: Andrew.Russell@Queens.ox.ac.uk
Andy's LinkedIn profile
Siân McGibbon
(3rd year Lawyer, University College)
Siân is the model lawyer along with everything that implies.
She has led the Policy and Practices element of our project, with a particular emphasis on intellectual property policy and its role in shaping the developing field of synthetic biology. Siân has a particular interest in this area of law, and the key role it will play in determining the future of genetic technology and in many other branches of science.
In addition, Siân has been involved in the development of the website (particularly though not exclusively the human practices pages) and has worked with Francesca to organize a wide range of outreach and engagement events.
After engaging with a wide range of audiences on multiple occasions during the course of the project, Siân will be presenting our project and her intellectual property policy research to a worldwide audience of experts, competitors, and judges at the Hynes Convention Centre in Boston.
Tim Ang
(3rd year Biologist, St John's College)
Tim's primary academic interests focus on evolutionary theory, particularly social evolution. A keen weightlifter, his frequent references to weights and protein shakes naturally make him the hub of enchanting conversation here at Oxford iGEM.
Tim is in charge of our interlab study and poster.
Emily Prichett
(3rd year Biochemist, University College)
Emily has been the latest addition to our team and turned out to be absolutely crucial for our entire social media activities. She loves the E.coli chat and has been a well-renown expert beyond the iGEM teams on growth curves and methylotrophs.
Philipp Lorenz
(3rd year Biochemist, University College)
It was Phil's idea to bring iGEM to Oxford, and he continues to ensure our project runs as smoothly as a German train schedule.
Phil's LinkedIn profile
Fran Donellan
(3rd year Biochemist, Oriel College)
Not just a member of the biochemist team but also leading our public engagement activities, no task is too big or small for Fran. This girl can provide sandwiches for 500 people at 24 hours' notice and look good doing it.
Shahbano Soomro
(3rd year PPEist, University College)
A third year student in Politics and Economics at University College, Shahbano has a particular interest in Environmental policy and philosophy. As well as helping Fran with organising our public engagement and events, she will be watching over our project from afar during the summer.
Matthew Booth
(3rd year Engineer, St John's College)
Matt is an avid Rugby player, having recently achieved great success with the college team. His main contributions to iGEM have been developing the light detecting electrical circuit and the stochastic model for mCherry expression.
Oliver Vince
(3rd year Engineer, University College)
Oliver is our keenest team member - nothing can douse his motivation. In addition to taking charge of the maths and software, he feels responsible for our entertainment and has kept us amused both inside the lab and out.
Oliver has led the modeling of the genetic circuits. He has also been responsible for the development of our prototype design using CAD/CAM and 3D printing technology, and has played a leading role in the construction of our website pages. As the first engineer to work on the project, Oliver has been instrumental in bridging the gap between the science disciplines involved, as well as working closely with the policy and practices team on realization and practicality of our design.
After presenting to various audiences on several occasions during the course of our project, Oliver will present Oxford iGEM's modeling work in Boston at the jamboree next month.
Leroy Lim
(3rd year Engineer, St John's College)
During term, Leroy indulges in many of the quirks of Oxford life, namely rowing, bops and colourful trousers. During iGEM, he's our engineer and self-appointed social sec.
Supervisors
Dr George Wadhams
George Wadhams’ research interests lie in how bacteria sense and integrate environmental information. His group focuses on understanding in a quantitative manner how multiple, homologous pathways operate in individual cells and how the components of these pathways can be used to create synthetic pathways.
Dr Ciarán Kelly
Ciarán Kelly obtained a PhD for his work in Frank Sargant’s group, constructing and characterising synthetic biohydrogen production pathways in E. coli. He is interested in the construction, characterisation, and re-engineering synthetic enzymes and pathways for the production of high-value chemicals.
Mr Karl Brune
Karl Brune's research interests lie in elucidating metabolic pathways. His previous work at Imperial College London was focused on engineering microbial consortia to enhance biomining and bioremediation, as well as on the study of photoautotrophic organisms.
Advisors
Professor Judy Armitage
Judy Armitage is interested in the dynamics of bacterial sensory transduction and the control of bacterial motility. In particular, her research group focuses on the communication between the sensory and adaption mechanisms of the two pathways as a model for sensory network integration in general..
Professor Anthony Watts
Anthony Watts’ group is devising solid state NMR methods for determining high-resolution details of information-rich sites within membrane receptors. Recent focus has been on the neurotensin receptor (NTS1), which is now available highly purified and monodispersed in detergent as well as in a ligand-binding form.
Professor Antonis Papachristodoulou
Antonis Papachristodoulou’s research interests include systems and synthetic biology, network systems, aerospace systems and flow control, and convex optimisation. Furthermore, he works on modern control theory, robust stability analysis and design, as well as nonlinear dynamical systems and Lyapunov stability.
Andreas Harris
Andreas Harris works on the design and implementation of gene regulatory networks harnessing feedback to increase robustness and tunability. The designs are based around transcriptional networks and attempt to translate well-understood control modules, such as proportional and integral controllers, to biological systems.
Dr Lucas Black
Lucas is an imaging specialist helping out with quantification of parts and to give general guidance throughout the project.  The team is very grateful for Lucas's excellent photography, including our team photos and the photograph of the Radcliffe Camera on our homepage.
