Restriction Digest
↩ Back to other protocols .
For a double digest, make sure that both enzymes are compatible and that a buffer exists in which both of them can work.
Add 6 uL of water into an empty Eppendorf tube.
Add 1uL of the buffer and 2 uL of the DNA or plasmid.
Add 0.5uL of each enzyme solution. Make sure the restriction enzymes are kept on ice before use.
Incubate for 1-2h at 37°C.
