Biochemists
Glen Gowers, Philipp Lorenz, Corinna Oswald, Andy Russell, Francesca Donnellan, and Emily Pritchett will take charge of the wet-lab work and biochemistry aspects of the project.
Philipp Lorenz
A third year biochemist, it was Phil's idea to bring iGEM to Oxford, and he continues to ensure our project runs as smoothly as a German train schedule. More importantly, he provides snacks for meetings and buys us drinks.
Corinna Oswald
Our St John's biochemist, Corinna, has been there from the beginning and she knows everything.
Glen Gowers
The guy who makes everything happen.
Francesca Donellan
Not just a member of the biochemist team but also leading our outreach programme, no task is too big or small for Fran. This girl can provide sandwiches for 500 people at 24 hours' notice and look good doing it.
Emily Pritchett
Our most recent addition to the team, Emily has just finished her second year at Teddy Hall.
Andy Russell
Biochemist and stash man; the team relies on Andy for science and for style.
