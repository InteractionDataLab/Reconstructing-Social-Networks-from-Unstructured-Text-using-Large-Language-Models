Streaking Plates
↩ Back to other protocols .
Obtain an LB agar plate.
Label the bottom of the plate.
Carry out the following steps in the lamina flow hood. Using a sterile inoculation loop touch the top of the bacterial stock that is to be plated out.
Gently spread the bacteria over the plate by streaking across one section of the plate. Then drag through the first section to streak over a second section of the plate. Then drag through the second section to streak the third section.
Incubate the plate overnight at the appropriate temperature (30°C for Pseudomonas and 37°C for E. coli).
