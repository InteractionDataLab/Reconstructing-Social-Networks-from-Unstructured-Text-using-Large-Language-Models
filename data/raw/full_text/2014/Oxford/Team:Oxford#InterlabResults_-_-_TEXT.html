We have given each measurement here in arbitrary units - as provided by our laboratory's plate-reader and spectrophotometer.
Adjusted fluorescence is calculated as the mean fluo of each biological replicate minus the mean fluo for the DH5-a, giving an approximation for the fluorescence due to the devices only.
Cell counts were estimated based the OD, using the online calculator given by the link:  www.genomics.agilent.com%2fbiocalculators%2fcalcODBacterial.jsp%3f_requestid%3d826255
Results were given in triplicate with respect to biological replicates (meaning three separate colonies were taken from the same plates); and duplicate with respect to the technical replicates (two 200ul samples were taken from each culture to be read).
Although it is clear from visual inspection that there are significant differences in fluorescence depending on device, the fluorescence of each sample can be modelled as the following function:
FLUO = DEVICE + AUTO(CELLS) + AUTO(MEDIA) + ERROR(BIOLOGICAL) + ERROR(TECHNICAL).
