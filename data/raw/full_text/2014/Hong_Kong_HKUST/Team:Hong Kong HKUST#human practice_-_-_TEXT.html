Human Practice Overview
The HKUST iGEM 2014 team has three main components for human practice: start-up kit, outreach, as well as safety and ethics. Our goal is to introduce the idea of synthetic biology to wide range of audience in the society. We targeted groups of audience consisting of college freshmen, secondary school students and members within the iGEM society. Each group of audience has potential to contribute to the field of synthetic biology in different ways, and we believe that putting equal amount of effort and paying attention to them all should be the best approach to ensure healthy growth and development of the field of synthetic biology.
Start-up Kit
Start-up kit is a manual designed to aid future iGEM teams in starting their own human practice projects. Click to find out more about the items we have prepared.
Outreach
A key element in human practice is to create a link between the society and synthetic biology. Check out whom we have reached out to during this process.
Safety and Ethics
Safety has been the foremost concern when it comes to laboratory experiment. Read more to see what the experts have to say about the safety aspects of our project.
