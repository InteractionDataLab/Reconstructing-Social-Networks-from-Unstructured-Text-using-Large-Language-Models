Main Project Abstract
Fig 1 . Here is the potato.
Here is the description of the potato: it is a potato!
Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths every year mostly in developing countries where vaccination      is unaffordable. To provide an affordable solution to combat pneumococcal diseases, we are engineering an E. coli “Pneumosensor”, that will      work inside an in vitro diagnostic device. Through this cheaper and easier diagnosis method, people can prepare themselves better against the      transmission and adversity of S. Pneumoniae. Pneumosensor has a rewired comCDE signal transduction pathway native to S. pneumoniae that detects     autoinducer molecules released specifically by S. pneumoniae. It is also equipped with a new promoter for the specific and tight regulation of      target gene expression in E. coli. In addition, the team is documenting and characterizing existing CR-TA riboregulators for post-transcriptional     regulation of gene expression. Our work will help other iGEM teams more effectively incorporate this tuning tool into their project design.
