Presentations are one of the most common and effective ways to share information and convey messages. This year, HKUST iGEM Team held two sessions of presentations for the freshmen. One session was conducted on the 26th of September for freshmen from School of Science, and another one was conducted on 13th of October for freshmen from School of Engineering. Through the presentations, we introduced synthetic biology and iGEM, explained briefly about our main project, shared our experiences joining the iGEM competition and encouraged the freshmen to join iGEM in the future.
