HO Yuan Heng Trevor
2nd year, MPhil in Bioengineering
Trevor is a 2nd year Master’s student in Bioengineering. This is his 4th year in iGEM and 3rd year as an advisor. He is combining basic biological parts, CRISPR/Cas system, microfluidic devices, simple modelling and other exotic tools from synthetic biology to gain insights into the significance of genetic regulation topologies in development. His interest includes establishing trending techniques in lab and testing cheap but effective substitutes for everything.
CARIM Sean
3nd year, BSc in Biological Science
Sean is a final year student majoring in Biology. He was a team member in 2012 and currently it is his 2nd year as a team advisor. Sean's first encounter with iGEM developed his interest in applied biological science, and since then he has always tried to find research opportunities where he could collaborate with engineers. He has worked on ocular drug delivery and engineering bio-reporter bacteria, and is now working in collaboration with researchers in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering to characterize phosphate-accumulating bacteria found in their wastewater treatment reactor. Outside academic life, Sean enjoys hiking, playing foosball, and dancing to '80s funk in his room when no one is watching.
LEE Hyun Jung Chloe
3nd year, BSc in Biochemistry
Chloe is a final year Biochemistry student. She was the member of HKUST iGEM 2013 team and it is her first year helping as a team advisor. She loves the interdisciplinary nature of iGEM, enforcing her to be open-minded to disciplines outside laboratory. She is currently working in a cell cycle lab, studying interactions between cell cycle regulatory proteins with yeast and mammalian cells.
HUI Wai In Winnie
3nd year, BSc in Biological Science
Winnie is a third year Biology student. She was the member of HKUST iGEM 2013 team. She was inspired by iGEM experiences to explore the field of research. She has worked in a stem cell lab and is currently working in a cell cycle lab. She would like to work on a disease related topic which could help people in the future. Besides having fun with cells in the lab, she also loves travelling, reading and playing instruments.
WILIAWATY Satien
3rd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Satien is a third year student majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. She is from Indonesia. She loves to try different kinds of food, sing, and watch movies. She would like to be involved in a research about different kinds of disease and find the solutions so that she can help people. She does not know whether she will graduate school or not. She is very happy to see this year iGEM team because it is very diverse and finally there are some business students join the iGEM team.
CHU Ka Long Derek
3nd year, BSc in Biochemistry
Derek is an undergraduate student majoring in Biochemistry. He was a member of the HKUST iGEM 2013 team.
ALIM Astrid Sephira
3rd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Astrid was a member of HKUST iGEM 2013 team. She has passion in lab work, which is shown during lab skills tutorial. Besides, she was very helpful when this year members were coding the wiki and designing the page.
GU Bida
4th year, BSc in Biological Science
Bida has become the advisor for several years. He is really nice and passionately gives suggestions to the new members in planning the project and also teach a lot of lab skills.
