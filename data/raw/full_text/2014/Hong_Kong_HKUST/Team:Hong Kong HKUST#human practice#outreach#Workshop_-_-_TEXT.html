Workshop
The meaning of life is a philosophical question concerning the significance of life or existence in general.       It can also be expressed in different forms, such as "Why are we here?", "What is life all about?",      and "What is the purpose of existence?" It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific,      and theological speculation throughout history.       There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will,      the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.

Here is the description of the potato: it is a potato!
Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe,      exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life.      Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality.
