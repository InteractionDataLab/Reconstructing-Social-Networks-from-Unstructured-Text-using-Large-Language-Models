CHO Haemin
2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
Haemin is a second year student majoring in Biotechnology. She is one of the two leaders of this year HKUST iGEM team. In the lab, she works diligently and is very helpful when needed. But most of the time, she looks blank-minded and often makes small careless mistakes. Her trademark quote is "What did I just do? *blank face*
JOO Min Jung
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
"What should be our team name... Pneutella? Pneutorious? ...Finding Pneumo!! Wait, let me draw a fish :)"
AW Jacqueline Theeng Mei
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Jacqueline is a year two student majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Apart from being a junior member in iGEM team, she is also the secretary of the team. Claiming to have above-standard laboratory skills, she performed various kinds of experiments. Quite often, she will work in the laboratory from 9am to 6pm. Unsurprisingly, she likes to attend every meeting and make reminders and minutes for every meeting. EVERY MEETING! (To those who don’t read her emails, be careful). Enjoying iGEM competition, she likes to perform site directed mutagenesis and Gibson assembly daily. Rapping is one of her precious abilities as well as stalking others. Indeed she is the number ONE stalker in the team. Although she tried very hard to shed this title, the fact that she is a stalker will not change.
CHAN Yuk Pui Alfie
3rd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Alfie has done so much for the team and to the lab. He also had a particular affection to the centrifuge. He loved it so much that he sometimes SLAMMED the cover to make sure it’s closed, then Raul would be jealous and said "DON’T SLAM THE CENTRIFUGE!" *Hmm... I wonder why the centrifuge got replaced* Alfie also liked the newly replaced centrifuge. He put smaller tubes than required- maybe thinking the big tubes were too heavy for the centrifuge, but he had to take care of the mess of broken tubes and split DNA inside the centrifuge. Lastly, he worked as a great team manager, and helped out the whole team by transferring to many different teams.
MAHANADI Albert
2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
Albert is a gentleman who cares about other people. He is one of the two people in charge of Human Practice group. Funny random thing about him: he likes to play games in the lab. He is Indonesian but he learned how to say bad words in Korean. So be careful when he starts speaking in Korean!
KIM Hye Ji
2nd year, BSc in Business and Management
Hye Ji is a sweet, soft-spoken girl who works mainly on human practice but helps out in the lab as well. She is the matchmaker of the team. She makes the other girls play 'Ideal Type World Cup' to find their best match in the iGEM team. Rumour has it that she also gives free relationship advice on the side.
TANG Tsz Ching Chloe
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Chloe is a second year student from Hong Kong taking her major in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. She is the PIC of the second group of the team. She is in charge of assigning and coordinating the group work. Other than that, Chloe is also competing with Jacqueline to be the number one stalker in the team; but up to this day, she has not been recognized as such, and ranked only third. Favorite quote: "I don't like colony PCR, so I make my groupmates do it hehe"
GOTAMA Rinaldi
2nd year, BSc in Biological Sciences
Rinaldi is from Indonesia. He is really good at photoshop and graphic design and is in charge of the graphic design team. He is famous for coming up with wacky names for the team and other team members. He is also famous for his shouting matches with Chloe in the lab. He tries to be serious and fierce at times but we all know that he is a softie at heart.
HAN Gyucheol James
2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
James is very tall and like to dance. He often wears a cap to the lab and classes. He is very friendly and open to everyone, and want to befriend with anybody. He is a very calm person that never complains, and always does what he wants. His life seems very simple and uncomplicated.
TONG Guillaume Huiming
2nd year, BEng in Computer Engineering
Guillaume is also known as William. He is a sophomore majoring in Computer Engineering and responsible for coding the Wiki page.  Although he majors in a subject unrelated to biology, he is very keen to learn about synthetic biology in iGEM. His ultimate goal is to build a cyborg! He loves woodcarving, baking, and playing violin.
SULAIMAN Jordy Evan
2nd year, BEng in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Jordy is a year two student majoring in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. He is hard-working, diligent, and creative. He likes to eat, play basketball, and play computer games. Above all, he likes Doyle the most. Though Jordy is very funny, sometimes he can be extremely serious when doing something. The scary part of Jordy is that he is good at everything, even arts. Everyone likes Jordy.
WIDJAJA Angeline
2nd year, BEng in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
Angie is the angel of iGEM. She is a cheerful girl who likes to work but also have fun at the same time. She loves to play basketball and play games with other people. She is excellent at making friends. There's nothing bad about her except for her spontaneous randomness. But that characteristic of hers is what makes iGEM fun in some way or another. Interesting and unique people are the ones who everyone should cherish.
BONGSO Nadia Benedicta
2nd year, BEng in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
She is one of the rare team members that do not major in Life Science, she is a year 2 student majoring Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (but still, biology is involved). She is one of the 3-man Indonesian gang, which contributes to most of the noise in lab. She is indeed very helpful in the lab, such as helping to fill boxes of tips just after a few hours she landed in HK. She also helped much in Human Practice work. She is quite absent-minded about her iPad, luckily she does not forget her lab work. She LOVES people calling her surname, and she really likes Hong Kong Disneyland.
SUH Joseph
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Joseph is a second year student majoring Biochemistry and Cell Biology from South Korea. He is one of the two people in charge of Human Practice group.  He is incapable of waking up early in the morning which is why he always gets the afternoon shift for doing the lab works. He likes playing music and eating sushi. Above all, Joseph is very funny and really like goofing around with the other members.
JANG Sang Jin Jason
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Jason is a second year student majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. He is from Korea but he spent most of his life in Singapore. He contributed to module 2 by using "educated guess" to figure out the gene sequence of combox. He is in the wiki team and contributes to build up the wiki page website.
NG Siu Wang Edward
2nd year, BSc in Biotechnology
Edward is known as a hardworking and diligent lab worker (or lover), that his passion has been our treasure. But everyone also remembered that Edward put 30μl of DNA ladder instead of 1μl when he ran a gel. I guess every newbie has made their own stupid mistakes. Even though he presented himself as nice as possible in front of everyone, he is really mean and snarky when he is speaking in Cantonese!
CUELLAR Raul M.
3rd year, BSc in Biological Sciences
Raul is a third year student majoring in Biological Sciences. He is one of our two senior members this year. He seems very intimidating at first but once you get to know him, he will joke around you until you are annoyed. He is also one of the busiest and most patient person in the lab, doing lab tasks and answering everyone's questions at the same time. Warning: when he starts telling one of his PBAD jokes... RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!
LEE Jihwan
3rd year, BSc in Molecular Biomedical Sciences
Jihwan is one of the two senior members of our iGEM team. This is his second year of participation, and he devotes much of his time and efforts into bringing the riboregulator project to a success. He kindly provides help and advice to us as an experienced senior. Being all-rounded in both academic and non-academic pursuits, he is the role model for inspiring the younger minds of our team to strive for excellence.
CHEUNG Ming Fung Eric
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Ming Fung, or Eric, is not only a second year student majoring in Biochemistry and Cell Biology, but also a computer guru who helps in coding our wiki page. Being calm and serious are two of his conspicuous traits. He is a diligent, responsible and obliging person and you will find him very comfortable to work with once you get to know him. Although he looks serious, sometimes he gives hilarious one-liners that makes everyone in the lab laugh out loud.
PARK Hojeong Bonnie
2nd year, BSc in Biochemistry and Cell Biology
Hojeong, or Bonnie, is a sophomore in Biochemistry and Cell Biology, and Chemistry (YES, she majors in BOTH). She loves cats, and she is simply the most artistic person in the whole team. She often takes her passion regarding cats and art to another level, and overwhelms people with her perks and quirkiness. Sometimes, she even labels herself as a 'cat'. She meows constantly in the lab for 'luck'.
