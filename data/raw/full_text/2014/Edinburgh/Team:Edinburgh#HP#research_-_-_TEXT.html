Summary
Research
After a long and thorough process powered by coffee, coloured whiteboard markers, our best brainstorming skills and a small pile of research papers, we distilled our research to the following 5 themes:
Specialisation: who does what in the system?
Communication: how do individuals transfer knowledge and information between one another?
Robustness: how does the system respond to emergencies and unexpected events?
Hierarchy: how is the internal structure organised?
Supervision: is there someone/something external monitoring the progress?
These emerged as the five most important factors that characterise the work of a modular system. Click on the sub-sections on the left to find out about each theme in more detail.
