RewirED
Smart bacteria could be the computers of the future – but first we have to wire them together. This year Edinburgh is excited to introduce metabolic wiring to iGEM, a novel way for connecting logic gates in different bacterial strains.
Wiring
What is metabolic wiring? Click here to hear about the bacterial computation, the benefits it offers, and how metabolic wiring makes it all possible.
Human Practices
What can our smart bacterial friends tell us about the way human teams work? Are iGEM teams any smarter than a population of smart bacteria?
Modelling
Why do an experiment when a computer can work out the result? Click here to learn about the models we used, the programs we created, and our collaboration with UCL.

Our Project
Metabolic wires are a new way of connecting logic gates in different cells – their orthogonality and extensibility means there is potentially no limit to how intelligent a population of bacteria can be.
We set out to make three sets of metabolic wires, using trans-genic aromatic enzymes, cis-genic aromatic genes, and ‘sugar logic.’ We also set out to build a population regulation system to showcase these wires, and a new set of degrons to make the system more robust.
