BBa_K1399000 - RFP(AAV)
Mutant RFP from Discosoma striata (coral) (see Part:BBa_E1010) with added AAV-ssrA degradation tag (Part:BBa_I11012). The tag increases RFP turn-over rate, thus providing better temporal resolution of red fluorescence. In the same time, maximal fluorescence amplitudes will be lower as newly formed protein is degraded as soon as it is formed.
BBa_K1399001 - RFP(LVA)
Mutant RFP from Discosoma striata (coral) (see Part:BBa_E1010) with added LVA-ssrA degradation tag. The tag increases RFP turn-over rate, thus providing better temporal resolution of red fluorescence. In the same time, maximal fluorescence amplitudes will be lower as newly formed protein is degraded as soon as it is formed. LVA tag is commonly found attached to repressors in various gene networks (e.g. oscillators). The tag encodes peptide sequence AANDENYALVA and is recognized by ClpA and ClpX unfoldases and ClpX mediator SspB. ClpA and ClpX then form a proteasome-like complex with ClpP protease and the protein is degraded.
BBa_K1399002 - RFP(LAA)
Mutant RFP from Discosoma striata (coral) (see Part:BBa_E1010) with added LAA-ssrA degradation tag (Part:BBa_M0050). The tag increases RFP turn-over rate, thus providing better temporal resolution of red fluorescence. In the same time, maximal fluorescence amplitudes will be lower as newly formed protein is degraded as soon as it is formed. The tag encodes peptide sequence AANDENYALAA and is recognized by ClpA and ClpX unfoldases and ClpX mediator SspB. ClpA and ClpX then form a proteasome-like complex with ClpP protease and the protein is degraded.
BBa_K1399003 - RFP(DAS)
Mutant RFP from Discosoma striata (coral) (see Part:BBa_E1010) with added SsrA-DAS degradation tag (Part:Ba_M0052). The tag increases RFP turn-over rate, thus providing better temporal resolution of red fluorescence. In the same time, maximal fluorescence amplitudes will be lower as newly formed protein is degraded as soon as it is formed. The tag encodes peptide sequence AANDENYADAS and is recognized by ClpA and ClpX unfoldases and ClpX mediator SspB. ClpA and ClpX then form a proteasome-like complex with ClpP protease and the protein is degraded.
BBa_K1399004 - GFP(LVA)
GFP (mut3b) (see Part:BBa_E0040) with added LVA-ssrA degradation tag. The tag increases GFP turn-over rate, thus providing better temporal resolution of green fluorescence. In the same time, maximal fluorescence amplitudes will be lower as newly formed protein is degraded as soon as it is formed. The tag encodes peptide sequence AANDENYALVA and is recognized by ClpA and ClpX unfoldases and ClpX mediator SspB. ClpA and ClpX then form a proteosome-like complex with ClpP protease and the protein is degraded.

In the same time, maximal fluorescence amplitudes will be lower as newly formed protein is degraded as soon as it is formed. The tag encodes E.coli wild type ssrA peptide sequence AANDENYALAA and is recognized by ClpA and ClpX unfoldases and ClpX mediator SspB. ClpA and ClpX then form a proteasome-like complex with ClpP protease and the protein is degraded.
BBa_K1399007 - GFP(DAS+2)
