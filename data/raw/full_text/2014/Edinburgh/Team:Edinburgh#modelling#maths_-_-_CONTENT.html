and P<SUB>3</SUB>). The first part of the formula is the logistic growth, and indicated in figure 3.
<EM>r</EM> is a constant growth rate being the same for the three populations. If more
details are to be added, this can be changed for each population to have its own
growth rate. <EM>k</EM> is the capacity, the maximum amount of P<SUB>1</SUB>, P<SUB>2</SUB> or P<SUB>3</SUB> obtained
when the logistic growth reaches the steady state.</P><P>The second part of these formulae correspond to the biological AND gate.
Each input is modelled as a logistic function (figure 1), which approximates
these inputs as biological binary signals (high and low concentrations). This
function is widely used in artificial neural networks as activation functions, so I
thought it could model these biological inputs accurately.</P><EM>Figure 1: Logistic function. The in
exion point is centered at 0</EM>.<P>What is the <EM>th</EM> parameter (<EM>th</EM><SUB>1</SUB>, <EM>th</EM><SUB>2</SUB> etc.) in the exponents? The logistic function has a property: adding a positive value to the exponent shifts the function.
If no value is added, the inflexion point is centered at 0 (figure 1), but we want
the inputs to be positive (near 1) once a certain threshold is reached. This is
just a convention for our modelling. The <EM>th</EM> values added to these exponents
are such thresholds. These are defined as parameters, so they can be varied.</P><P>Why is the output of the AND gate defined as the product of the two in-
puts? Following the basics of boolean algebra, an AND gate is defined as the
boolean product of the inputs, so that the output is 0 in case one of the inputs is 0: 01
= 0, 11
= 1, etc. An OR gate would be defined as the boolean sum:
0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 1, 0 + 0 = 0, etc. This case involves continuous values
instead of binary ones, ranging from 0 to 1. However, the product still works
very well. For example, if one input 1 is 0:1 and input 2 is 0.9, the product
0.10.9 = 0.09 returns a very small value, approximating the boolean product
01
= 0 in a realistic way. If inputs are 0.90.9 = 0.81 the product returns a high
value.</P><P>Formulas 4, 5,6 correspond to the signal translation from mRNA, where production and natural degradation are involved, including the signal uptake done
by bacteria, which also involves the degradation of signals due to the metabolic
reactions involved inside the cells which absorb it.</P><P>Formulas 5, 6,7 just involve the mRNA production of degradation. This
mRNA is the one used to produce the signals, and depends directly on the
current amount of population (see how P1, P2 and P3 are involved in these
equations).</P><H3>Output</H3><P>In this section, an explanation of the simulation is given. Figure 2 shows the
amount of bacteria the three different bacterial strains. Population 1 depends
upon population 2 and 3, i.e., it will not start growing faster till population 2
and 3 reach a larger amount of bacteria.</P><EM>Figure 2</EM><H2>BSim Model</H2><P>Agent-based models are a powerful tool to create and simulate models of bacte-
rial populations where spatial location is important. We used BSim (an agent-
based models library for Java) to create an animation of what the system would
look like inside a bioreactor (figure 3). However, the model is a simplification
which would require further development to be as realiable as the ODE model.
In this case, there is a global condition which allows the blue population to grow
once the other two populations reach a certain threshold. The improvements
would involve the implementation of chemical discussion of the signals through
the media and the corresponding ODE equations inside the cells for the transcription, translation and consumption of signals.</P><P>In summary, a complete simulation with BSim would be very powerful and
reliable when implementing the inter-cellular interactions with the tools agent-
based model others (chemical diffusion, for example), and the intracellular func-
tionallity with ODEs, also allowed by this library. We encourage future teams
working on population-based systems to create a full ODE model and an agent-
based model (ABM) to compare its performance.</P><EM>Figure 3</EM><P>Our intention was to create a web interface which abstracts the modeller
from programming in Java when building and ABM. Due to a lack of time it
was not possible to do, but we encourage future teams to do it or supervisors
to propose this idea as a project for their students.</P><H2>Simulation of Degradation Rates</H2><P>A more simple task consisted on the simulation of different degrons and their effects with a bistable system.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="tourleftbottom"><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/project/parts">← Our BioBricks</A></DIV><DIV id="tourrightbottom"><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/modelling/software">Software →</A></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
