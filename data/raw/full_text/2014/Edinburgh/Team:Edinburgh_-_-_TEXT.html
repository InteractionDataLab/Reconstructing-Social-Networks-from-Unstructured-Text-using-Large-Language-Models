RewirED
Better control of bacterial populations should allow more complex biological systems to be created. RewirED has worked to bring the first components of that future closer through iGEM, in order to allow greater access and sharing of scientific knowledge, and greater communication and responsiveness from bacteria.
Our aims
In order to improve globally equality, both monetary and medically, the accessibility of new technologies is imperative. Our project designed a intercellular communication and control system that could be used to stabilise the composition of dynamic population of bacteria. This would simplify the use of complicated biological systems such as microbial consortia.

Our Project
We focused on the definition of microbial consortia, namely, systems. This was done through three sub-projects; Metabolic wiring and the three wires we investigated, degron characterization to improve the responsiveness of systems, and population control to experiment with actual control mechanisms. Policy and Practices informed the considerations of our model system’s design and it in turn influenced the exploration of these same themes in iGEM teams.
Modelling
Why do an experiment when a computer can work out the result? Click here to learn about the models we used, the programs we created, and our collaboration with UCL.
Human Practices
What can our smart bacterial friends tell us about the way human teams work? Are iGEM teams any smarter than a population of smart bacteria?
Art and Outreach
Learn about some novel ways in which we tried to get the message out about our project.
