Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.</LI><P>We set out to ask 'What is the role of Division of Labour in a modular system, in human terms? What factors do we need to consider if we want to design such a system?' We made a social sciences report based on our research of the role of division of labour in modular systems, by finding links between various systems, ranging from social to biological ones. We interviewed other iGEM teams, and analysed our own, on topics of role allocation (specialisation), team structure, communication and supervision. We then applied the principles to bacterial systems, and adapted the design of our scientific project to include the lessons learned. See <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/HP/summary">here</A> for more information.</P></OL><H2>Gold Medal Criteria</H2><OL><LI>Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry.</LI><P>We improved the characterisation of eleven parts, which can be seen on our <A href="https://igem.org/2014_Judging_Form?id=1399">judging form</A>. For example, see our improved characterisation of part BBa_I11012 <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I11012:Experience">here</A>.</P><LI>Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.</LI><P>This year we have collaborated with the UCL team. We used our antisense RNA generator software to provide them with the optimal antisense gene for knocking down their target gene. We also analysed their existing antisense gene and tried to predict its efficacy. UCL helped us out by testing our prediction on this matter with the resultant real world data on its efficacy. For more details, see this <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/modelling/software#uclcollab">description</A>.</P><P>We also worked with the Zurich team, providing some raw data for one of their models, which utilised some of our metabolic wires.</P><LI>iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy &amp; Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.</LI><P>We interviewed six iGEM teams, in order to inquire about how their teams divided their tasks, how they communicated, and how they were organised. See full description of the strategy <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/HP/strategy">here</A>. We then applied the findings from our interviews to the design of a bacterial system, and adapted the design of our own scientific project accordingly. We also generalised our findings, so that they can be easily adapted for use in any system, be that a bacterial system, an iGEM team or otherwise.
