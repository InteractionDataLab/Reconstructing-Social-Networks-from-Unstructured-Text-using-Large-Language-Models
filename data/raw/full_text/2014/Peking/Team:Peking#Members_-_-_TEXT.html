HUANG Xiaoyu
Huang Xiaoyu is a junior in the School of Life Sciences, Peking University. She is responsible for art design in the team, including wiki pages, posters and team uniforms. She is an amateur designer, but with love for art and design, as well as painting. In this project, she learned a lot and got many excellent ideas from other members.
JIN Yuji
Jin Yuji is a sophomore at Peking University majoring in life sciences. He mainly focuses on system and synthetic biology. He has deep interests in the behavior of biosystem and the sophisticated interaction of its components. As a lab manager of 2014 Peking iGEM team, he spent much of his time in the wet lab work this summer. His work is mainly the degradation section of the project. He enjoys the competition and is willing to share ideas with iGEMers all over the world. In spare time, he also has deep affection for many abstract strategy games.
LU Xiaoyu
Lu Xiaoyu is a sophomore majoring in life sciences at Peking University. As the one being responsible for raising Cyanobacteria as well as a member of killing group, she has always been trapped with a paradoxical problems: how to keep cyanobacteria alive and how to kill them. Besides lab hours, she enjoys gardening and photography. She even kept a growing album for her little Pitaya, but now her album is mostly occupied by living or dead Cyanobacteria. She also loves collecting fluffy toys. Her Alpaka is the mascot of Peking 2014, welcoming friends from all over the world and bringing bless to every colleague in the lab.
MENG Liuyi
Meng Liuyi is a sophomore at Peking University majoring in life sciences. During the past year, she has been participating in Peking iGEM experiments and managing our team’s finance. She mainly worked on the construction of binding parts and tests of them. She loves playing Chinese chess and painting. She is also looking for making friends in the Giant Jamboree.
MU Xuelang
Mu Xuelang is a sophomore at Peking University majoring in life sciences. She is in charge of the protein expression and purification in the project. She worked with her partner Zhu Shiyu in a physical chemistry lab during this summer. They have purified several interesting and useful proteins for other parts in this project. She is interested in cryobiology and synthetic biology, especially in the signal transduction pathways and cell survival pathways. To this girl, the most beautiful things in all universe, are the most mysterious. Out of the lab, She really enjoys the starry starry night, cult movies and poetry.
NI Congjian
Future physicist Ni Congjian is in his second year of undergraduate school. Complexity of bio-system caught his attention. He wants to develop a brand new mathematical language to describe this complexity some day in the future. Reading comic and playing harmonica are special interests for him in relaxing time.
Sherry TENG
Sherry Teng is a sophomore from the University of California, Los Angeles, majoring in cell, molecular and developmental biology. As an exchange student from UCSF, she enjoyed staying in Beijing over the summer and immersing herself in the culture. Her function in the project was to construct the gas vesicle component, which aids in the killing module of the project.
WANG Chenggong
WANG Chenggong is a junior from the School of Physics. He worked on model and wiki building. During the past year, he was also participating in team communication and project design. It is the interest in synthetic biology that lets him join in the Peking iGEM, and he really enjoys the time with his team members
WU Jie
Wu Jie is a sophomore majoring in life sciences. He worked on Suicide Parts. He has special interest in microbiology, and maybe he has fallen in love with E. coli. During his spare time, he enjoys in gathering all kinds of information about microorgansim.
YAO Lanqiu
Yao Lanqiu is in her fourth year in Peking University. Her major is Clinical Medicine. As a doctor in the future, she likes to do medical examination for other guys in the lab. She is in charge of the killing part, focusing on finding tools to kill cyanobacteria. At the same time, she helps maintain the operation of the laboratory. Besides synthetic biology, she has special interest in mathematics . She does enjoy the Peking iGEM 2014 project this summer.
YU Congyu
Yu Congyu is a sophomore majoring in life sciences in Peking university. During the summer, he read hundreds of papers and provided suggestions to the wet lab members. Paper reading seems to be one of his hobbies. Though didn’t spend as much time as his fellows in labs, he really enjoy the time they shared.
In his spare time, Yu Congyu loves going to fitness center and bike riding. He is also fond of playing the violin, though not that fascinating.
ZHANG Fengyu
Zhang Fengyu is a sophomore at Peking University majoring in life sciences. He focuses on the molecular cloning and activity assay of microcystinase MlrA. Besides, he also carries through some molecular cloning in suicide part. He is interested in synthetic biology, especially enjoying the process of experiment. He has the idea that it is not easy to be a “professional worker”. He is hoping to optimize the process of experiments in order to get better results in less time. This year, the summer in Peking iGEM 2014 is a most unforgettable time of his college life. He is also interested in board role-playing games and music.
ZHANG Zijian
Zhang Zijian is a sophomore from the Peking University, majoring in life sciences. This year, he constructed some biobricks to finally make it possible to bind E. coli to cyanobacteria cells. Inside the lab, he likes taking pictures of the cells under the fluorescence microscope and telling cold jokes. Outside the lab, he enjoys playing football and exploring the city on his bike. He always wants to build something with fancy materials, and iGEM really gave him the chance. However, he is still eager to build more.
ZHU Shiyu
Zhu Shiyu is a sophomore from School of Basic Medical Sciences. He worked on the expression and purification of fusion proteins, including His-tagged MlrA and MVN-YFP. Outside the laboratory, he spends time in reading and listening to music. He enjoys working with his cooperative and diligent partners during this summer.
