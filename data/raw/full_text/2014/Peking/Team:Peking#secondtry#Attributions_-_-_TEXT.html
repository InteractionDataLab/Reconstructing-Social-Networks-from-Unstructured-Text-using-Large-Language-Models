Binding: Zhang Zijian&Meng Liuyi
An important improvement was constructing by these two members. They tested binding efficiency between E.coli and cyanobacteria. Equipped with fluorescence microscope, they calculated binding efficiency of protein-algae and E.coli-algae interaction.
Killing: Yao Lanqiu&Lu Xiaoyu
Killing cyanobacteria is the core of our project, so YAO and LU spent a lot of time searching for a weapon. Finally, lysozyme was chosen from tens of candidates. They measured cyanobacteria growth curves under different conditions. Killing effects on different species of cyanobacteria were tested by them, which showed the wide applicability of our project.
Degradation: Jin Yuji&Zhang Fengyu
Algae toxins are serious threats from algal bloom. Degradation group found a enzyme MlrA that can degrade it. A sophisticated experiment assay was established to test degradation efficiency.  Several signals were tried for the sake of secreting MlrA outside cells.
Suicide: Wu Jie
Considering biosafety, a suicide system was introduced into our E.coli. Wu Jie made effort transferring induction suicide system into E.coli. He tested growth curves of E.coli under variant inducing conditions.
Gas vesicle: Sherry Teng
Sherry came to Peking iGEM during the summer and was taking the gas vesicle experiments. She used strains from OUC-China and did a lot to make them float. More than experiments, Sherry polished Peking‘s wiki drafts.
Protein purification: Mu Xuelang&Zhu Shiyu
To get quantitative data of binding and degradation, we planned to use purified proteins to do experiments. These two members spent the whole summer working with proteins. The purified proteins supported subsequent experiments and provided reliable data.
Model: Wang Chenggong&Ni Congjian
Using mathematic methods modelling biology phenomenon is what we used this year. We established 3 models, binding model, application model, and cellular burden, corresponding binding  experiments，killing experiments, and cell burden estimation respectively. Besides model, Wang as team leader, contributed much confirming our experimetns progress. And he build the framework of our wiki.
Art design: Huang Xiaoyu
Huang Xiaoyu designed logo, icons for each group, and wiki for Peking iGEM 2014. What’s more, ppt template, poster and banner were from her hands. And she beautify our photos.
Team leader: Yu Congyu
As team leader of Peking iGEM 2014, YU and vice team leader organized experiments and set timeline for each group. He finished the human practice part of our project and led a field investigation to Taihu lake to get firsthand material of algal bloom.

These teachers offered us many experiments equipment . Without their help, we shall never finish so many experiments to make our ideas into reality. During experiments, these teachers also gave us much constructive advice, which assisted us a lot.
