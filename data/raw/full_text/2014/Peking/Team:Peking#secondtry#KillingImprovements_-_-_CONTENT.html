cyanobacteria. To make our project feasible in future applications, we have to find ways to enhance the killing 

effect. As our model indicates, binding our <I>E. coli</I> to the cyanobacteria can help us achieve this goal. So we 

searched for proteins that can bind to the targeted <I>M. aeruginosa</I> cells and we chose to work with microvirin 

(MVN), a mannan binding lectin in <I>Microcystis aeruginosa</I> PCC7806, since of its high specificity to the 

cyanobacteria and its availability to our <I>E. coli</I>. Microvirin is a protein consisting of 108 amino acid 

residues and it has one mannan binding site which can bind to the LPS of the <I>M. aeruginosa</I> cells <SUP>[1]

</SUP>. In our project, MVN was displayed on the surface of <I>E. coli</I> cells using a kind of truncated INP 

(INPNC). By this way, we could bind our <I>E. coli</I> to <I>M. aeruginosa</I> and thus help us increase the overall 

killing effect.</P><P>However, cyanobacteria are usually floating in the surface water due to its gas vesicles and colony formation in 

the field. So we also equipped our cells with gas vesicles to deal with the problem that <I>E. coli</I> cells mostly 

sink to the bottom when put into water. This will increase the opportunity for an <I>E. coli</I> cell to approach a 

cyanobacteria cell and enhance the killing effect too.</P><H2 id="0802">Design</H2><P>To make our genetically engineered <I>E. coli</I> bind to <I>Microcystis aeruginosa</I>, we used a kind of 

truncated Ice Nucleation Protein (INPNC) to display microvirin (MVN) on the surface of our <I>E. coli</I>. We also 

used GFP as a reporter to make the binding effect &quot;visible&quot;.</P><P><B>INPNC</B> is a kind of modified INP with truncation of the entire internal repeating domain. We chose to work 

with INPNC because it has been reported to be an excellent surface display system used in <I>E. coli</I> in recent 

years <SUP>[2,3]</SUP>. INPNC can be be expressed on the cell surface at a high level, without affecting the cell 

membrane structure and cell proliferation, which is really crucial in our case. Also, the size and structure of MVN 

are both proper for the INP display system <SUP>[2]</SUP>.</P><P>The plasmid containing INPNC coding sequence that we used came from the iGEM distribution 2014 (BBa_K523013).</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 1.</B> Schema of the surface display system using INP and INPNC. INP N-

domain, which is relatively hydrophobic, anchors INP in the out membrane. INP C-domain is hydrophilic and exposed to 

the medium, which can be used to link the passenger protein on its C-terminus. The internal repeating domains serve 

as the template for ice nucleation, and are not necessary for protein display. Depicted are the <B>(a)</B> full-

length INP with no truncation and <B>(b)</B> INP with truncation of the internal repeating domains. 

</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P><B>MVN</B> is a lectin isolated from the cyanobacterium <I>Microcystis aeruginosa</I> PCC7806. It is an 108 aa 

protein that consists of 2 domains. According to a carbohydrate microarray carried out previously, MVN binds to 

carbohydrate and the highest signals are observed with structures that contain α(1 → 2) linked mannose 

residues <SUP>[1]</SUP>. A binding partner of MVN was identified in the lipopolysaccharide fraction of <I>M. 

aeruginosa</I> PCC7806 and it possibly represents the O-antigen of a LPS. MVN has been previously expressed in <I>E. 

coli</I> and its binding effect to cyanobacteria cells is highly species-specific <SUP>[1]</SUP>. The availability 

and specificity are the reasons why we chose MVN in our project.</P><P>We optimized the gene sequence of MVN at first and de novo synthesized this gene from commercial company 

(Genscript, Nanjing, China).</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 2.</B> Solution structure of MVN. MVN consists of 2 domains, domain A 

and domain B, which are colored yellow and blue respectively. Domain A is formed by residues 38-93 while domain B is 

formed by residues 1-37 and 94-108. The mannan binding site is only found in domain A. This figure is taken from 

Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2Y1S).</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>We fused INPNC and MVN together to anchor MVN on the outer membrane. MVN is oriented outwards into the medium to 

recognize and bind to the specific cyanobactera cells. We added a 10 aa flexible protein domain linker in between to 

make sure that MVN and INPNC can function separately without much mutual interference. The fusion protein INPNC-MVN 

is expressed under a library of constitutive promoters including BBa_J23106, BBa_J23105, BBa_J23114, BBa_J23117 and 

BBa_J23113. We also designed our <I>E. coli</I> to express GFP at the same time. The <I>E. coli</I> cells were later 

co-incubated with <I>M. aeruginosa</I> and observed under the fluorescence microscope afterwards. The fluorescence 

of GFP and chlorophyll A can help mark our <I>E. coli</I> and <I>M. aeruginosa</I> so that we could identify the 

binding effect later.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 3.</B> Schematic representation of the binding reaction between <I>E. 

coli</I> and <I>Microcystis aeruginosa</I>. INPNC anchors at the outer membrane of the <I>E. coli</I> and displays 

MVN on its C terminus. Linker1 is the blue strand between INP C-domain and MVN . MVN has one Man &amp;#945(1 &amp;#8594 2) 

Man binding site which is a typical component in the LPS of the <I>M. aeruginosa</I>. <I>E. coli</I> and <I>M. 

aeruginosa</I> are bound together by the intermolecular force.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>In addition to this <I>E. coli</I> - <I>M. aeruginosa</I> binding assay, we also designed two additional tests. 

One test is a direct binding assay with <I>M. aeruginosa</I> and purified MVN protein to prove the binding ability 

of MVN directly and the other test is a rTEV protease digestion assay to estimate the amount of MVN oriented 

outwards. Detailed information will be described in the Results.</P><H2 id="0803">Results</H2><H4>MVN - <I>M. aeruginosa</I> binding assay</H4><P>We carried out a binding assay using purified MVN protein and <I>M. aeruginosa</I> to test the binding ability of 

the MVN produced by our <I>E. coli</I>. A similar MVN binding assay has been carried out by Kehr, J. C. et al. in 

2006, but our experiment is different in that we fused eYFP to the MVN and we did the experiment with two different 

strains of cyanobacteria.</P><P>We used pET-21a(+) as the vector to construct a plasmid for the expression of the His<SUB>6</SUB>-tagged version 

of MVN-eYFP (see <B>Fig. 4</B>) During construction, we retained the promoter, RBS, His&amp;#8901Tag and terminator that 

were on the original vector. We inserted MVN and eYFP coding sequence into the plasmid via Gibson Assembly. After 

the construction, the plasmid was transformed into <I>E. coli</I> BL21(DE3) cells and induced afterwards to initiate 

the expression. After lysing the cells, the crude extracts were applied to Ni<SUP>2+</SUP>-nitriloacetate columns 

and the fusion protein was purified and later used in our binding assay. </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 4.</B> Final construct of the protein-purifying plasmid. The promoter, 

RBS and terminator are native ones on the pET-21a(+) vector. Linker1 is the 10aa flexible protein domain linker 

added to avoid protein interference between MVN and eYFP.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>The purified protein was later used in binding assay with two different strains of cyanobacteria, <I>M. 

aeruginosa</I> PCC7806 and <I>M. aeruginosa</I> FACHB-1343. The cyanobacteria colony were broken up by mild 

sonication at first. The protein was added to aliquots of cyanobacteria culture and later observed under 

fluorescence microscope. (Results here) </P><H4>rTEV protease digestion assay</H4><P>INP can help display our protein on the outer membrane, but the orientation is unsure. So we designed this rTEV 

protease digestion assay to verify that MVN is oriented outwards into the medium. Also we can roughly estimate the 

amount of outward-displayed MVN that can be digested each <I>E. coli</I> from the result too.</P><P>We constructed the functioning plasmid by the means of PCR and Gibson Assembly. The plasmid uses pSB1C3 as the 

vector and expresses the fusion protein INPNC-MVN-mRFP. We designed a 7aa protein linker named Linker2 between INPNC 

and MVN which can be specifically recognized and digested by rTEV protease. Also, there is a Linker1 between MVN and 

mRFP to ensure that the fluorescence is not affected. The coding sequence is regulated by the promoter J23105, the 

RBS B0034 and the terminator B0015. We transformed the plasmid into <I>E. coli</I> BL21(DE3) after the construction 

work.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 5.</B> Final construct of the plasmid for rTEV protease digestion assay. 

Linker2 is a 7aa linker that can be specifically digested by rTEV protease. Linker1 is the 10aa flexible protein 

domain linker mentioned in Figure.4. The whole INPNC-MVN-mRFP fusion protein is expressed under the constitutive 

promoter J23105.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>To make our results persuasive, we also constructed 3 control groups: C1, C2 and C3. Plasmid C1 has the Linker2 

shifted to Linker1 so that it can not be digested by rTEV protease. Plasmid C2 has the INPNC and Linker2 sequence 

deleted so that MVN-mRFP is not displayed on the cell surface. Plasmid C3 has the whole coding sequence from INPNC 

to mRFP deleted. We also have a blank control group with no cells added.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 6.</B> Gene circuits of the control groups. <B>(a)</B> Plamsid C1 

differs to the original plasmid in that Linker2 is shifted to Linker3, which is a 8aa flexible protein domain linker 

that cannot be cut by rTEV protease. <B>(b)</B> Plasmid C2 has the coding sequence of INPNC and Linker2 deleted. 

<B>(c)</B> Plasmid C3 is a plasmid with only the promoter, RBS and terminator left on the 

vector.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Cells of the experiment group and control groups were cultured to the exponential phase. Afterwards rTEV protease 

as well as buffer were added to the cell cultures according to the protocol from the company. The cell cultures were 

co-incubated with rTEV protease and centrifuged afterwards to separate the cells and MVN-mRFP that was cut down by 

the protease. The fluorescence intensity of the supernatant could stand for the amount of MVN-mRFP and was measured 

by microplate reader (For experimental details please see the Protocols).</P><P>The same procedure was applied to every group for 3 times. The average results are shown in the chart below (see 

<B>Chart 1</B>), and the fluorescence intensity data is shown in A.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Chart 1.</B> The fluorescence intensity data measured by a microplate 

reader.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>As can be seen from the results shown here, the fluorescence intensity of the experimental group is higher than 

that of the C2 and C3 groups by a large margin. Considering the precision of our equipment, this can demonstrate 

that <B>the MVN-mRFP fusion protein is truly displayed outwards by using the INPNC displaying system</B>. The 

results of the Experimental group and C1 group are close and it may be because of the breakage of Linker1 when we 

centrifuged the cells. However, the relatively high result of the C1 group is still in accordance with the 

demonstration. </P><H4><B><I>E. coli</I> - <I>M. aeruginosa</I> binding assay</B></H4><P>This assay is the final testing to identify the binding effect of our genetically modified <I>E. coli</I>. First, 

we designed and constructed the plasmid for the experiment group (See <B>Fig. 7</B>). As described in the Design, we 

inserted 2 transcription units into the same vector pSB1C3. One transcription unit that encodes INPNC-MVN under a 

library of promoters was first introduced by the means of PCR and Gibson Assembly. The second transcription unit 

that codes for GFP only was first constructed in another plasmid and later inserted into the first plasmid by 

Biobrick Standard Assembly. We also constructed one plasmid for the control group that only had the second 

transcription unit encoding GFP. After construction, the plasmids were transformed into <I>E. coli</I> BL21(DE3) 

cells. </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>&gt;<B>Figure 7.</B> The final construct of the &quot;Binding&quot; plasmid. One transcription 

unit that expresses INPNC-MVN and one that expresses GFP are inserted into the same plasmid pSB1C3. GFP is expressed 

under the constitutive promoter BBa_J23117 while INPNC-MVN is expressed under a library of constitutive promoters 

(Pc). INPNC and MVN are separated by Linker1 which is a 10aa flexible protein domain linker.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>We also carried out this binding test with 2 different strains of cyanobacteria, <I>M. aeruginosa</I> PCC7806 and 

<I>M. aeruginosa</I> FACHB-1343. The cells of the experiment group and control group were both incubated till their 

OD600 reached 0.6. Then both <I>E. coli</I> and <I>M. aeruginosa</I> were applied to short period of mild sonication 

to break up the colony formed and harvested by centrifugation and PBS washing. <I>E. coli</I> and <I>M. 

aeruginosa</I> were co-incubated and observed under fluorescence microscope afterwards. We used microscopic counting 

to quantify the binding effect. The same procedure was used to the cells with plasmid having different promoters. 

(Result here) </P><H2 id="0804">Gas vesicles</H2><P>Two proteins, GvpA and GvpC are needed to form a protein complex to help the <I>E.coli</I> cells float. 

<B>GvpA</B>, a hydrophobic protein with the size of 7.4 kDa, is assembled as the framework of the protein complex, 

which is later stabilized by the hydrophilic protein <B>GvpC</B>, a larger protein consisting of 193 residues. GvpA 

and GvpC can assemble into a low-density protein cylinder in assistance of floating (see <B>Fig. 8</B>). Gas fills 

space inside the protein complex by diffusion while water is rejected outside.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><B>Figure 8.</B>  Schematic presentation of the Gas vesicle formation. Two 

proteins, GvpA and GvpC, are expressed in <I>E.coli</I> at the same time. Then, they can polymerise in to a protein 

complex Gas Vesicle which has a lower density than water so that E.coli can be floating in the 

water.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Floating cells regulate the proportion of GvpA and GvpC by having different ORF copies in the gvp cluster. On 

average, the molar ration of GvpA and GvpC is around 30:1 in one cell. Considering this, we inserted gvpA and gvpC 

gene into pSB1C3 and pSB4A5 vector respectively to get the wanted expression results. The OUC-China iGEM team used 

this design in 2012 and we continued to adopt this strategy in our project this year. The gene cluster was also
