Introduction
In our project, we eliminate algal bloom by designing E. coli to secrete proteins that can lyse the   cyanobacteria. To make our project feasible in future applications, we have to find ways to enhance the killing   effect. As our model indicates, binding our E. coli to the cyanobacteria can help us achieve this goal. So we   searched for proteins that can bind to the targeted M. aeruginosa cells and we chose to work with microvirin   (MVN), a mannan binding lectin in Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806, since of its high specificity to the   cyanobacteria and its availability to our E. coli. Microvirin is a protein consisting of 108 amino acid   residues and it has one mannan binding site which can bind to the LPS of the M. aeruginosa cells [1] . In our project, MVN was displayed on the surface of E. coli cells using a kind of truncated INP   (INPNC). By this way, we could bind our E. coli to M. aeruginosa and thus help us increase the overall   killing effect.
However, cyanobacteria are usually floating in the surface water due to its gas vesicles and colony formation in   the field. So we also equipped our cells with gas vesicles to deal with the problem that E. coli cells mostly sink to the bottom when put into water. This will increase the opportunity for an E. coli cell to approach a   cyanobacteria cell and enhance the killing effect too.
Design
To make our genetically engineered E. coli bind to Microcystis aeruginosa, we used a kind of   truncated Ice Nucleation Protein (INPNC) to display microvirin (MVN) on the surface of our E. coli. We also   used GFP as a reporter to make the binding effect "visible".
INPNC is a kind of modified INP with truncation of the entire internal repeating domain. We chose to work   with INPNC because it has been reported to be an excellent surface display system used in E. coli in recent   years [2,3]. INPNC can be be expressed on the cell surface at a high level, without affecting the cell   membrane structure and cell proliferation, which is really crucial in our case. Also, the size and structure of MVN   are both proper for the INP display system [2].
The plasmid containing INPNC coding sequence that we used came from the iGEM distribution 2014 (BBa_K523013).
Figure 1. Schema of the surface display system using INP and INPNC. INP N-  domain, which is relatively hydrophobic, anchors INP in the out membrane. INP C-domain is hydrophilic and exposed to   the medium, which can be used to link the passenger protein on its C-terminus. The internal repeating domains serve   as the template for ice nucleation, and are not necessary for protein display. Depicted are the (a) full-  length INP with no truncation and (b) INP with truncation of the internal repeating domains.
MVN is a lectin isolated from the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806. It is an 108 aa   protein that consists of 2 domains. According to a carbohydrate microarray carried out previously, MVN binds to   carbohydrate and the highest signals are observed with structures that contain α(1 → 2) linked mannose   residues [1]. A binding partner of MVN was identified in the lipopolysaccharide fraction of M.   aeruginosa PCC7806 and it possibly represents the O-antigen of a LPS. MVN has been previously expressed in E.   coli and its binding effect to cyanobacteria cells is highly species-specific [1]. The availability   and specificity are the reasons why we chose MVN in our project.
We optimized the gene sequence of MVN at first and de novo synthesized this gene from commercial company   (Genscript, Nanjing, China).
Figure 2. Solution structure of MVN. MVN consists of 2 domains, domain A   and domain B, which are colored yellow and blue respectively. Domain A is formed by residues 38-93 while domain B is   formed by residues 1-37 and 94-108. The mannan binding site is only found in domain A. This figure is taken from   Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2Y1S).
We fused INPNC and MVN together to anchor MVN on the outer membrane. MVN is oriented outwards into the medium to   recognize and bind to the specific cyanobactera cells. We added a 10 aa flexible protein domain linker in between to   make sure that MVN and INPNC can function separately without much mutual interference. The fusion protein INPNC-MVN   is expressed under a library of constitutive promoters including BBa_J23106, BBa_J23105, BBa_J23114, BBa_J23117 and   BBa_J23113. We also designed our E. coli to express GFP at the same time. The E. coli cells were later   co-incubated with M. aeruginosa and observed under the fluorescence microscope afterwards. The fluorescence   of GFP and chlorophyll A can help mark our E. coli and M. aeruginosa so that we could identify the   binding effect later.
Figure 3. Schematic representation of the binding reaction between E.   coli and Microcystis aeruginosa. INPNC anchors at the outer membrane of the E. coli and displays   MVN on its C terminus. Linker1 is the blue strand between INP C-domain and MVN . MVN has one Man &#945(1 &#8594 2)   Man binding site which is a typical component in the LPS of the M. aeruginosa. E. coli and M.   aeruginosa are bound together by the intermolecular force.
In addition to this E. coli - M. aeruginosa binding assay, we also designed two additional tests.   One test is a direct binding assay with M. aeruginosa and purified MVN protein to prove the binding ability   of MVN directly and the other test is a rTEV protease digestion assay to estimate the amount of MVN oriented   outwards. Detailed information will be described in the Results.
Results
MVN - M. aeruginosa binding assay
We carried out a binding assay using purified MVN protein and M. aeruginosa to test the binding ability of   the MVN produced by our E. coli. A similar MVN binding assay has been carried out by Kehr, J. C. et al. in   2006, but our experiment is different in that we fused eYFP to the MVN and we did the experiment with two different   strains of cyanobacteria.
We used pET-21a(+) as the vector to construct a plasmid for the expression of the His6-tagged version   of MVN-eYFP (see Fig. 4) During construction, we retained the promoter, RBS, His&#8901Tag and terminator that   were on the original vector. We inserted MVN and eYFP coding sequence into the plasmid via Gibson Assembly. After   the construction, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and induced afterwards to initiate   the expression. After lysing the cells, the crude extracts were applied to Ni2+-nitriloacetate columns   and the fusion protein was purified and later used in our binding assay.
Figure 4. Final construct of the protein-purifying plasmid. The promoter,   RBS and terminator are native ones on the pET-21a(+) vector. Linker1 is the 10aa flexible protein domain linker   added to avoid protein interference between MVN and eYFP.
The purified protein was later used in binding assay with two different strains of cyanobacteria, M.   aeruginosa PCC7806 and M. aeruginosa FACHB-1343. The cyanobacteria colony were broken up by mild   sonication at first. The protein was added to aliquots of cyanobacteria culture and later observed under   fluorescence microscope. (Results here)
rTEV protease digestion assay
INP can help display our protein on the outer membrane, but the orientation is unsure. So we designed this rTEV   protease digestion assay to verify that MVN is oriented outwards into the medium. Also we can roughly estimate the   amount of outward-displayed MVN that can be digested each E. coli from the result too.
We constructed the functioning plasmid by the means of PCR and Gibson Assembly. The plasmid uses pSB1C3 as the   vector and expresses the fusion protein INPNC-MVN-mRFP. We designed a 7aa protein linker named Linker2 between INPNC   and MVN which can be specifically recognized and digested by rTEV protease. Also, there is a Linker1 between MVN and   mRFP to ensure that the fluorescence is not affected. The coding sequence is regulated by the promoter J23105, the   RBS B0034 and the terminator B0015. We transformed the plasmid into E. coli BL21(DE3) after the construction   work.
Figure 5. Final construct of the plasmid for rTEV protease digestion assay.   Linker2 is a 7aa linker that can be specifically digested by rTEV protease. Linker1 is the 10aa flexible protein   domain linker mentioned in Figure.4. The whole INPNC-MVN-mRFP fusion protein is expressed under the constitutive   promoter J23105.
To make our results persuasive, we also constructed 3 control groups: C1, C2 and C3. Plasmid C1 has the Linker2   shifted to Linker1 so that it can not be digested by rTEV protease. Plasmid C2 has the INPNC and Linker2 sequence   deleted so that MVN-mRFP is not displayed on the cell surface. Plasmid C3 has the whole coding sequence from INPNC   to mRFP deleted. We also have a blank control group with no cells added.
Figure 6. Gene circuits of the control groups. (a) Plamsid C1   differs to the original plasmid in that Linker2 is shifted to Linker3, which is a 8aa flexible protein domain linker   that cannot be cut by rTEV protease. (b) Plasmid C2 has the coding sequence of INPNC and Linker2 deleted. (c) Plasmid C3 is a plasmid with only the promoter, RBS and terminator left on the   vector.
Cells of the experiment group and control groups were cultured to the exponential phase. Afterwards rTEV protease   as well as buffer were added to the cell cultures according to the protocol from the company. The cell cultures were   co-incubated with rTEV protease and centrifuged afterwards to separate the cells and MVN-mRFP that was cut down by   the protease. The fluorescence intensity of the supernatant could stand for the amount of MVN-mRFP and was measured   by microplate reader (For experimental details please see the Protocols).
The same procedure was applied to every group for 3 times. The average results are shown in the chart below (see Chart 1), and the fluorescence intensity data is shown in A.
Chart 1. The fluorescence intensity data measured by a microplate   reader.
As can be seen from the results shown here, the fluorescence intensity of the experimental group is higher than   that of the C2 and C3 groups by a large margin. Considering the precision of our equipment, this can demonstrate   that the MVN-mRFP fusion protein is truly displayed outwards by using the INPNC displaying system. The   results of the Experimental group and C1 group are close and it may be because of the breakage of Linker1 when we   centrifuged the cells. However, the relatively high result of the C1 group is still in accordance with the   demonstration.
E. coli - M. aeruginosa binding assay
This assay is the final testing to identify the binding effect of our genetically modified E. coli. First,   we designed and constructed the plasmid for the experiment group (See Fig. 7). As described in the Design, we   inserted 2 transcription units into the same vector pSB1C3. One transcription unit that encodes INPNC-MVN under a   library of promoters was first introduced by the means of PCR and Gibson Assembly. The second transcription unit   that codes for GFP only was first constructed in another plasmid and later inserted into the first plasmid by   Biobrick Standard Assembly. We also constructed one plasmid for the control group that only had the second   transcription unit encoding GFP. After construction, the plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)   cells.
>Figure 7. The final construct of the "Binding" plasmid. One transcription   unit that expresses INPNC-MVN and one that expresses GFP are inserted into the same plasmid pSB1C3. GFP is expressed   under the constitutive promoter BBa_J23117 while INPNC-MVN is expressed under a library of constitutive promoters   (Pc). INPNC and MVN are separated by Linker1 which is a 10aa flexible protein domain linker.
We also carried out this binding test with 2 different strains of cyanobacteria, M. aeruginosa PCC7806 and M. aeruginosa FACHB-1343. The cells of the experiment group and control group were both incubated till their   OD600 reached 0.6. Then both E. coli and M. aeruginosa were applied to short period of mild sonication   to break up the colony formed and harvested by centrifugation and PBS washing. E. coli and M.   aeruginosa were co-incubated and observed under fluorescence microscope afterwards. We used microscopic counting   to quantify the binding effect. The same procedure was used to the cells with plasmid having different promoters.   (Result here)
Gas vesicles
Two proteins, GvpA and GvpC are needed to form a protein complex to help the E.coli cells float. GvpA, a hydrophobic protein with the size of 7.4 kDa, is assembled as the framework of the protein complex,   which is later stabilized by the hydrophilic protein GvpC, a larger protein consisting of 193 residues. GvpA   and GvpC can assemble into a low-density protein cylinder in assistance of floating (see Fig. 8). Gas fills   space inside the protein complex by diffusion while water is rejected outside.
Figure 8. Schematic presentation of the Gas vesicle formation. Two   proteins, GvpA and GvpC, are expressed in E.coli at the same time. Then, they can polymerise in to a protein   complex Gas Vesicle which has a lower density than water so that E.coli can be floating in the   water.
Floating cells regulate the proportion of GvpA and GvpC by having different ORF copies in the gvp cluster. On   average, the molar ration of GvpA and GvpC is around 30:1 in one cell. Considering this, we inserted gvpA and gvpC   gene into pSB1C3 and pSB4A5 vector respectively to get the wanted expression results. The OUC-China iGEM team used   this design in 2012 and we continued to adopt this strategy in our project this year. The gene cluster was also   kindly give by the OUC-China iGEM team.
