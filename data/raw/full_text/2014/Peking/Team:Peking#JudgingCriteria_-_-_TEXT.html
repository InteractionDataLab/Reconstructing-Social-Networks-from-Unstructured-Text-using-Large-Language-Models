Judging Criteria
Through five months of hard work, we have witnessed great development of our project, and we have prepared for the criteria for the Giant Jamboree. We successfully submitted 12 newly designed iGEM Registry Standard parts while using existing iGEM parts as well. We have also investigated the algal bloom in Taihu Lake. Moreover, we have helped several teams including BIT, BNU , and OUC-China, and we received assistance from the ZJU-China and OUC-China. We also popularized iGEM to undergraduates in Peking University campus. In conclusion, we have met all the requirements for an iGEM team, so we believe that we deserve Gold Medal.
Judging form
1.iGEM Registry of Standard Biological Parts
We have designed and constructed 12 brand new BioBrick Parts, and these parts were well documented on the Part Registry pages. The parts are shown as follows:

Part number
Characterisation
Function
BBa_K1378001
MlrA
An enzyme degradating toxin microystin
BBa_K1378003
Microvirin(MVN)
A lectin from Microcystis.aeruginosa
BBa_K1378005
INPNC-linker2-MVN-linker1-mRFP
Fusion protein testing INP direction
BBa_K1378007
INPNC-MVN and constitutively expressing GFP
E.coli-cyanobacteria binding effect testing
BBa_K1378009
INPNC-linker(rTEV)-MVN and constitutively expressing GFP
E.coli-cyanobacteria binding experiments control group
BBa_K1378022
pelB-MlrA
MlrA with a signal peptide from Sec pathway
BBa_K1378023
TorA-MlrA
MlrA with a signal peptide from TAT pathway
BBa_K1378024
MlrA-terminator
Modified MlrA
BBa_K1378025
pelB-MlrA-terminator
Modified pelB-MlrA
BBa_K1378026
TorA-MlrA-terminator
Modified TorA-MlrA
BBa_K1378031
Holin
Hole protein in suicide system
BBa_K1378032
Endolysin
Muralytic enzyme in suicide system
We should emphasize that these de novo parts were built from scratch, and the part BBa_K1378005 , BBa_K1378007 and BBa_K1378001 have experimental data available both on our wiki and on part registry pages.
We also used parts BBa_K554009 , BBa_K523013 , and BBa_K208006 from iGEM Part Distribution and further distribution directly from the Registry. These parts have played important roles in the killing and its improvement parts of our project.
2.Team communication
The significance of team interactions has long been recognized by Peking iGEM and this year our team members and instructors had visited several other teams and was involved in a reginal iGEMers' Meet Up in Wuhan this summer.
Furthermore, we have helped other teams in this summer, including BIT, BNU, and OUC-China. See here . We also received help from ZJU-China that they helped us to transfer specific genes into E. coli’s genome. We also helped two high school students from Beijing Huiwen Middle School and Beijing No.4 High School.
3.Investigation beyond bench
Holding the belief that responsive research lies beyond lab bench, we visited Taihu Lake in July to investigate the algal bloom there. We interviewed the researchers in NIGLAS(Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) who monitoring the algal bloom there and we sampled the water in the Taihu Lake and brought these samples back to our lab.
