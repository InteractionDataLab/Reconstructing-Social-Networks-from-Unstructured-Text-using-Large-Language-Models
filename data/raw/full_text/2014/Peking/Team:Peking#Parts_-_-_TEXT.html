INPNC-Linker (rTEV)-MVN-mRFP
Main Page-BBa_K1378005
BBa_K1378005 is a composite part coding INPNC-Linker (rTEV)-MVN-mRFP fusion protein. We confirmed that fusion protein is truly displayed outwards by using the INPNC displaying system by  rTEV protease digestion assay method and thus help characterize INPNC part.

MlrA
Main Page-BBa_K1378001
MlrA is a protease which can cleavage Microcystin(MC) and and thus reduce its toxicity. We tested it in E.coli and showed that MlrA can decrease the concentration of MC and weaken its inhibitory activity to protein phosphatase 1.

INPNC-MVN & GFP
Main Page-BBa_K1378007
BBa_K1378007 is a composite part coding INPNC-MVN fusion protein and GFP. E.coli carrying this plasmid will display MVN on the cell surface and bind to M. aeruginosa as well as expression GFP, thus the binding phenomenon can be easily observed.
