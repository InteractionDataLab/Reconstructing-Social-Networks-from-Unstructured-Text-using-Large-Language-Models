MUSE TALK
Muse Talk
On September 1st,  we did a presentation at a workshop called “MUSE TALK”. At this event, people  working for IT company as a manager, executive officer, engineer, or consultant  mainly participate to learn about things out of their line. The contents of the  presentation are listed below.
• What is iGEM
• The trend in synthetic biology  (The trend in iGEM 2013)
• The project of Team Tokyo_Tech  2013
• The development of technique  that supports iGEM
(BioBrick, database related to synthetic biology, MATLAB,  etc.)
• Introduction of Team  Tokyo_Tech
• What Team Tokyo_Tech 2014 has  been doing since the new team was organized
In  the presentation, we used many pictures and figures in the slide to make it easier  to image synthetic biology, which is a completely new field for them.
