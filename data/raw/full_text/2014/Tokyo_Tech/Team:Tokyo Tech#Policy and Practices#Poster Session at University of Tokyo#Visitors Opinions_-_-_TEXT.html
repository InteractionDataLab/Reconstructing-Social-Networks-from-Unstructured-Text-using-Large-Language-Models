This seems    really interesting!

It will be great    if this research advance and become a venture company like Euglena.

(If highly-efficient,)    it'll be very interesting.

I feel that    using solar energy is the best way to solve energy problems, so I hope you do    well in the research.

If you can make    more energy with solar battery, it will be very useful.

I thought the    idea was really interesting. I see that efficiency goes down in the presence    of oxygen. I hope you can solve this problem and do well in the competition.    Good luck!

Changing the    heading into Bacteria Biotechnology might be better.

How about    producing organic compound with photosynthetic bacteria in the upper layer,    and making the lower layer oxygen-free?
Solar Battery

It might be    efficient if you can produce organic matter from microbe carcass and waste in    the soil.

Bacteria-using    solar battery seems very low-efficient.

If you know how    to raise efficiency this would be interesting.
Pollen Allergy

I thought it    would be better to make a patch that can stick the bacteria on the skin and absorb the allergen from the skin.

Calculate the    reaction velocity→it might be slow. Genetic engineering    is scary. Adapt the cholesterol in the blood vessel?
Pollen Allergy
Y
Female

The problem is    how you stabilize E. coli inside the body, but I think the idea is    interesting.
Pollen Allergy

The explanation    was really easy to understand!
Pollen Allergy

Good luck on    curing the pollen allergy!
Pollen Allergy

If you can use E.    coli and prevent the allergic symptoms, it'll be revolutionary.
Pollen Allergy

I heard that you    cannot cure pollen allergy, so if this system becomes reality, I am very    delighted.
Pollen Allergy

I have pollen    allergy, so I would like to try this!
Pollen Allergy

I want to cure    pollen allergy.
Pollen Allergy

Can't you also    use it for other medicines?
Pollen Allergy

I think it's a    great idea to make good use of E. coli in health care, which didn't have an    important role in human life before.
Pollen Allergy

I have a pollen    allergy, so I look forward for this new immunotherapy to become reality. I    hope this treatment will be used widely in the world.
Pollen Allergy

I have pollen    allergy, so I'm glad if it can be cured with E. coli. I hope this new    treatment comes true!

This project    sounds very useful, so I hope it comes true one day.
Pollen Allergy

I thought it's    very interesting idea! When you make E. coli produce the allergen, how long    will the sequence be? If it's too long, it might be difficult for E. coli to    make it.
Pollen Allergy
Y
Male
13
I have pollen    allergy, so think it will save a lot of people if this treatment becomes    reality.
Pollen Allergy

I'm having a    hard time with pollen allergy. Please make it come true!
Pollen Allergy

I really look    forward for inventing a treatment using E. coli. This project is also    interesting commercially.

Can you use this    for preventing obesity? Do you crush mast cells?
Pollen Allergy

I have pollen    allergy, so I look forward for the realization of this treatment. Also, I    became very interested in iGEM.

Can you keep the    E. coli alive inside the body by taking medicines?
Pollen Allergy
B

How about    putting the allergen on the skin? (Last year's iGEM team UT-Tokyo did)
Pollen Allergy

Male

Isn't it hard to    control the allergen amount?
Pollen Allergy

There's already    immunotherapy using rice.
Pollen Allergy

What's the advantage    of using E. coli? Can you make it work inside the body? Isn't there any need    for putting it in the blood vessel?
Pollen Allergy
B
Female
21
I thought it is    dangerous to emit the allergen made by E. coli inside the body.
Pollen Allergy
B
Male
19
I think it's    dangerous if the E. coli survive inside the body after the treatment is    completed.
Pollen Allergy

What's mast    cell?
Pollen Allergy
B
---

I think the    biggest advantage is that you only have to dose only once by using E. coli.    However, you have to make E. coli able to work in a long span. Also, you have    to think of a method to release the allergen gradually. E. coli cannot live    for a long time, so you have think about that also.
Pollen Allergy

There was a    sub-project of 2012 UT-Tokyo that dosed epitope sequence into the body    instead of allergen.

Allergen is not    only one type. It’s hard to purify.

I've heard that    acute symptom occurred in dust immunotherapy. You have to be careful about    that.
Pollen Allergy

I'm receiving a    treatment for immunotherapy right now, but dose is postponed when I'm in bad    health. If you use E. coli for immunotherapy, you cannot manage these    problems.

Which way does E.    coli move when the flagellum rotates? Straight or random?

What is the    mechanism of the existent lie detector?

Is it possible    to use a substance unique to sweat for sensing? What kind of device do you    use for dropping?
Lie Detector

Male

You sweat on a    hot day in summer or after exercising, but how do you distinguish those from    the sweat caused by lying?
Lie Detector

By integrating    Na⁺ channel into E.    coli flagellum, can you tell the difference between ON/OFF?
Lie Detector

Is it possible    to make a paste type lie detector?
Lie Detector

I think you can    make one other than using E. coli.

Can you use the    same device many times? Or after using it once, do you have to through away?

Maybe the    exchange of things can be used for communication.

It seems most    feasible.

It might be more    interesting if E. coli can collect many types of things.

(For the 2nd    story) It'll be awesome if you can make a system importing the molecules not    in use and when it becomes inconvenient, those molecules will be exported.

Transporting DNA    might be good.
Bank

Why don't you do    it with membrane protein?
Bank

You have to make    the poor E. coli send a signal also.

It'll be    interesting if you can exchange radioactive cesium.
Bank

---

I think E. coli    divides when it's eutrophic, so you need to watch the borderline carefully.
Bank
B
---
---
Isn't it hard to    exchange things without changing the E. coli's condition? I think you need a    bacteria that prompts to induce things.
Bank

What kind of    protein are you thinking to make? How about water purification?

Using the soil    is okay, but I think you can collect more phosphate with WWTP activated    sludge.

I think there    was a team in iGEM that collected phosphate in the past.

I didn't have    any good image of E. coli… but now I know that it can    make allergen and electricity which help our lives, and its image changed.    I'll keep our hopes up on E. coli.
