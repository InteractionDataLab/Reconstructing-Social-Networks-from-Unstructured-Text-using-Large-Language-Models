Yuta Kino (Team Leader)
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
Course of Biological Information
I’m the leader of team Tokyo_Tech 2014. Why I decided to participate in iGEM is because, it is a precious opportunity for me to do research on our favorite themes with my teammates. To continue research in the future, I think it is necessary to turn my eyes not only to Japan but also to the world. I look forward to interchanging with students from foreign countries through iGEM.

iGEM is a competition where students with various backgrounds from many countries gather to compete. In order to improve my English and expand my knowledge, I thought iGEM was the perfect opportunity. Being able to do this as an undergraduate is a valuable experience, so I will do my best and try to learn as much as I can from this competition.
 
 
 
Yuya Nakamura
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
Course of Biological  Information
I decided to participate in iGEM because I thought it is a good opportunity to improve my ability and interchange with people from all over the world. Since I’m planning to enter graduate school and do research competing with other countries, so I think this challenge will be helpful for me.
 
 
 
Ayaka Murase
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
Course of Bioengineering
I decided to take part in iGEM because this is a great opportunity to communicate with people from all over the world. An ordinary undergraduate do not have a chance like this, so I am very glad to attend this competition. I am planning to study abroad in graduate school, so I look forward to hearing a lot from students outside of Japan.

Course of Biological  Information
iGEM was very attractive for me because it is an international contest and we can present in front of people from many countries. Also, being able to do a full-scale study before belonging to laboratories was very interesting to me. Through iGEM, I hope I can improve myself by doing my best.
 
 
 
Keina Matsumura
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
Course of Biological  Information
I decided to participate in iGEM because we can do a research on a theme that we are interested in, which is a precious experience for undergraduates. I want to treasure the chances given in my university life, so when I heard about iGEM, I made up my mind to attend. I am sure that communicating with good students from all over the world will be a good stimulus for me.

I am so glad that I have a chance to join this year’s iGEM competition. I think iGEM provides me a chance of both learning and self-improving. I hope that my journey with iGEMers will be the most meaningful and unforgettable experience in my university life. And it will also be a good experience for my further study in other foreign countries!
 
 
 
Kai Ye
School  of Science
Department of Mathematical and Computing Sciences
I’m glad to join this year’s iGEM competition. This experience must be valuable for me because there is almost no opportunity to compete with the world while we are students. Since I major in Mathematical and Computing Sciences, I wanted to contribute to the team by doing programming. I look forward to talking with many students from other countries at the Jamboree!
 
 
 
Paniti Achararit
School  of Engineering
Department of Information Engineering
I decided to participate in iGEM because it was a good opportunity for students from other major to study something out of their field. Although I am not familiar with biology, I wanted to contribute to the team by doing programming and constructing the website. I hope I can communicate with many people at the competition.
 
 
 
Takuya Kato
School  of Science
Department of Physics
Although I major in Physics, I am also interested in biology and decided to join iGEM. My role is carrying out modeling, which is very challenging for me, but I think it was a good experience. By the way, my hobby is to make “origami”, the historical culture of Japan. If you are interested in “origami”, please talk to me!
 
 
 
Riku Shinohara
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Biotechnology
iGEM is a very precious opportunity for students not belonging  to laboratories to do a research. By attending iGEM, I would like to interact with students from all over the world and receive a lot of stimulation. I hope this experience becomes helpful in my future life as a researcher of biology.
 
 
 
Gyomon Ryu
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Bioscience
This is the first time to go to America, so I feel very excited. I want all of you to talk to me, and I am looking forward to meeting and talking with other students who are studying biotechnology. By the way, I not only like researching but also doing outdoor sports. Let’s become good friends!
 
 
 
Kodai Hibi
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Bioscience
When I was a freshman at Tokyo Tech, I belonged to a tennis club. Now that I am a sophomore, I think I should do something that I had never done in high school. So I joined this year’s iGEM. I will do my best preparing for the competition, and I hope this experience will be valuable to me in the future.
 
 
 
Miyabi Hishinuma
School  of Biotechnology and Bioscience
Department  of Bioscience
I choose to participate in iGEM because I want to create something new by ourselves other than just taking classes and submitting reports. I also wanted to complete a task by working in a team, so iGEM was the perfect opportunity for me. By communicating with students from all over the world, I hope I can expand my knowledge and use this experience in the future.
