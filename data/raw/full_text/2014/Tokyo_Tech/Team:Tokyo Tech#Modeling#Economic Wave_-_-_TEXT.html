1. Abstract
From the advice we received from entrepreneurs, we  introduced economic wave into our system. Even though the introduction of  economic wave destructs the system of Company and Customer, Bank helps Company  and Customer to grow well.
 
 
2.  Integration  to our circuit
Our integrated economic wave is expressed as in  Fig. 4-4-2-1.
 
Fig. 4-4-2-1. Economic wave term
 
This term is added to the C4HSL equations as in Fig. 4-4-2-2.

3. Result
3.1. Bank helps Company and Customer even in
the  presence of economic wave
Even though the Company and Customer can grow well only by themselves,  introduction of economic wave destructs the system of Company and Customer.  This is shown in Fig. 4-4-3-1.

Fig.4-4-3-2 shows the C4HSL concentration during  the simulation.

As shown in Fig. 4-4-3-2, the system of Company and  Customer has enormous amount of money when there are no economic wave. But once  the economic wave has been introduced, then because of the recession during the  wave, they all die.
When the Bank is added, Bank helps Company and Customer  to grow well. This is shown in Fig. 4-4-3-3(left). The C4HSL concentration  during the simulation is shown in Fig.4-4-3-3(right).

During the recession in the economic wave, the Bank supplies  money to the economy. Because of this, they all can grow well.
 
3.2. Bank cannot help Company and Customer enough  in the presence of harsh economic wave
Additionally, we simulated how the system will behave in the  presence of harsh economic wave. Harsh economic wave we introduced is described  as in Fig. 4-4-3-4.

With the presence of the harsh economic wave, the Company  and Customer cannot survive. When the Bank is included, even though the Bank  helps Company and Customer they cannot grow stably. This result is shown in  Fig. 4-4-3-5.
 
Fig. 4-4-3-5. With the presence of harsh economic  wave, Company and Customer cannot grow well (left). When the Bank is included,  all of them can survive but the Bank cannot help sufficiently (right).
 
Although the Bank tries to stable the money supply by  switching its state many times(Fig. 4-4-3-6), since the fluctuation of money  supply is very harsh (Fig. 4-4-3-6), Company and Customer cannot endure the  fluctuation enough.
