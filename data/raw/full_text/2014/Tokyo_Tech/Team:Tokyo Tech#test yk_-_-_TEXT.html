 Introduction
 
 Poster Session at University of Tokyo
We participated in a poster  session held at University of Tokyo on May 18th. iGEM teams from all  over Japan
gathered at this event and introduced their project to the visitors. Not only students and professors at the university, but also people without any  scientific background came and listened to our projects. After introducing our projects, we asked  visitors  for feedbacks to  make our projects better. Our main purpose of this event was to  make people know what iGEM is, and change the negative  thinking  of synthetic biology, which people usually have.
The Projects
To introduce our projects to  the visitors, we made a poster for each project. We tried our best to make it  easy for people from any background to understand by using figures. Besides posters  for our projects, we also made an introduction of iGEM to get more people know  about it.
Here are the five projects that  we introduced at the poster session: solar battery, treatment for pollen  allergy, lie detector, E. coli Bank, and fertilizer.
• Solar  Battery
 
 
Solar energy  is  one of the alternative sources of energy widely used in the world. In this  project, we made a solar battery by using photosynthetic bacteria and current  generating bacteria to generate power. Wherever sunlight shines, electricity can be  generated by this solar battery. It  has been invented in some institutes, but the low efficiency and inconvenient  hardware still tend to be a problem. Therefore, we tried  to improve the efficiency of existing bacteria-using solar battery to  make it practical.
 
 
• Treatment for Pollen Allergy
 
 
In Japan, it is said that one  in five people suffers from pollen allergy. More than twenty million people  have this symptom and the number is increasing every year. In order to cure  this, we thought of using E. coli in immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is one of the  recently developed treatment which can completely cure the allergy symptom. You  put the allergen into the body from very small amount, and by gradually increasing  it, you can suppress the body′s excess allergic reaction. However,  there are several defects in this treatment. You have to go to the hospital for  treatment many times, and it takes three to five years for a complete recovery.  By using E. coli, we tried to invent a faster and easier immunotherapy.
 
 
• Lie Detector
 
 
In  this project, we tried to make a lie detector by using E. coli. By putting Na+  channel in the flagellum motor, E. coli reacts with the sodium ion included in  the liar′s sweat and starts running. If the E. coli moves,  it touches lysozyme and the outer membrane dissolves. Then, ATP inside the E. coli  will come out and reacts with luciferase to glow.
 
 
• Bank E.coli
 
 
We  thought of making E. coli act as a bank by taking things in and out. We had two scenarios for this  theme:
• Exchanging  things between Bank E. coli and Consumer E. coli
• Taking  things in and out by a group of Bank E. coli
Other than these stories,  recreating the bursting of the bubble economy with E. coli was also in the  plan.
 
 
• Fertilizer
 
 
Microelement  fertilizer is very important to the growth of crop. However, more than 70% of the  fertilizer is unused in soil. Phosphorus included in the fertilizer becomes  insoluble by binding with metals, such as aluminum and calcium. Since plants  cannot absorb these immobilized phosphorus, the phosphorus accumulates in soil.  To solve this problem, we decided to use E. coli to degrade the immobilized  phosphorus into phosphoric acid which plants can absorb. After producing  phosphoric acid, E. coli stores it in its body in a polymeric form. By  collecting these E. coli and extracting the polymer, we can retrieve the  phosphorus left in soil.
 
 
Results
After introducing  what iGEM is and our projects to the visitors, they gave us many advices and  opinions. We prepared blue and yellow Post-it, and asked them to write their  opinions down on it. Good points were written on yellow Post-it, and bad points  or suggestions were written on blue Post-it. We reflected the feedback and  comments from the visitors to make our projects better (The comments that visitors gave  for each project are listed in Table 1) We thank all the visitors  for cooperating us in this poster session.
Many  visitors, especially people without any scientific background, had negative  thinking of E. coli at first. However, by introducing the properties of E.  coli, they changed their mind. On the Post-it, there were many opinions saying  that they were looking forward to new inventions using E. coli. We can say that  our goal, which is letting people know and changing the negative  thinking of  synthetic biology, has been achieved.

Interview on Science Magazine "Newton"
On June 17th, we  had an interview on graphic science magazine Newton. Newton is one of  the most popular science magazine born in Japan. Although it is a scientific  book, easy contents and catchy photos are used, so it has been read by  many people regardless of age and sex. In the article, the history and requirements of  iGEM, as well as what our team has done in preparing for the Jamboree were  written. The article is shown below.

Muse Talk
On September 1st,  we did a presentation at a workshop called “MUSE TALK”. At this event, people  working for IT company as a manager, executive officer, engineer, or consultant  mainly participate to learn about things out of their line. The contents of the  presentation are listed below.
    • What is iGEM
    • The trend in synthetic biology  (The trend in iGEM 2013)
    • The project of Team Tokyo_Tech  2013
    • The development of technique  that supports iGEM
     (BioBrick, database related to synthetic biology, MATLAB,  etc.)
    • Introduction of Team  Tokyo_Tech
    • What Team Tokyo_Tech 2014 has  been doing since the new team was organized
In  the presentation, we used many pictures and figures in the slide to make it easier  to image synthetic biology, which is a completely new field for them.
