4.) Risks of Your Project Now
 
a) Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
- Without drinking large amount of sample, there is no risk.Such taking might cause irritation to skin,eyes,and respiratory tract.
 
b) Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):
- Wihtout drinking large amount of sample, there is no risk.Such taking might cause irritation to skin,eyes,and respiratory tract.
 
c) Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
- Production of AHL might perturbate communications in wild bacteria.
 
d) Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
- Use of plant hormone in the opposite direction could disrupt growth of crops.Malicious usage of phage might pertubate intestinal flora.
 
e) What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
- Do not eat,drink,smoke,prepare or store foods in laboratories.
     -                 Wear a lab-coat(white coat) while you are in a bio-lab.
     -                Keep the lab tidy and clean.
     -                Put labels on containers.
     -              Practice disinfection,sterilization,and washing hands.
 
5.) Risks of Your Project in the Future
 
a) What new risks might arise from your   project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d   of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the   environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if   the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
- Excess produce of oxalic acid may cause urinary stone.(a)
     -                 We can farm any poisonous plants easily. (b)
     -                 Too many phosphate may cause contamination of environment.(c)
     -               Diabetes patient may have danger if he or she intakes Cystein over 1500mg.(a)
 
b) Does your project currently include any   design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to   make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design   any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis,   physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM   project, but many teams choose to explore them.
- We have to consider potential risks in Bioremediation.               When our project grow, limitation of solid use will be needed.
