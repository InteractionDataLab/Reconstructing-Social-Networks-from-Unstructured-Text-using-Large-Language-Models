We thank this interaction which strongly influenced our scientific-project planning. Evaluation of our educational tool from students majoring in biology clearly showed the usefulness of the tool (Fig 6-1-0-1).

They appreciated us for creating cards and teaching the students about synthetic biology in a simple and approachable way. </P><P class="info-18">It was their first time to learn about synthetic biology in detail, so the principals were impressed of the possibility of this field. However, they had doubts about the safety using genetically engineered creatures. Since those creatures do not exist in nature, we do not know what will happen when they are released into the wild. If something happens, it might take a long time to get the previous nature back. Many people have this fear of genetic engineering, and this leads to the bad image of synthetic biology. Based on these doubts, we explained to them the scientists’ measurements for safety. When we make a discovery, for example “iPS cells”, we consider if it is okay to use them for human or nature on a long-term basis. Just like inventing a new medicine, we have to test them on animals for more than ten years, and when the safety is secured, we decide to use them on human. </P><P class="info-18">By discussing with the principals, we were able to know the public mind toward synthetic biology. We feel this image is due to the ignorance of this field. If we can get more people informed of the reality of synthetic biology, maybe we can change the general opinion. We will continue interacting with a variety of people so that more and more people can learn about synthetic biology. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P> </P><P align="center" class="title-small">7.

Our Question About Biosafety</DIV></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" class="info-18"> </TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" class="info-18"> </TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2"><P class="info-18">Through the activities mentioned <A href="#Important">above</A>, we found one question about our project : how can we can solve the safety problem (related to the commercialization. )</P><P class="info-18">Our approaches to this problem were interview to a biosafety specialist. </P><P align="left" class="info-18">We consulted the biosafety expert, Mr. Tomoya Saito, who is working for National Institute of Public Health. He gave us a lecture on dual-use technology. After that, we asked him some questions about biosafety. </P><P align="left" class="info-18"> </P><P class="info-18">Q1. When we use bacteria that produces harmless substances, does a biosafety or biosecurity problem arise? (Naoto)</P><P class="info-18">A1. In that circumstance, it is necessary to find out whether the problem comes from the bacteria or the substances. In other words, the measurement against the problem differs depending on whether the problem is biohazard or chemical hazard.</P><P class="info-18"> </P><P class="info-18">Q2. No matter how hard we try to keep biosafety, there remains a probability that researchers themselves might abuse the technology. How can we prevent that? (Riku)</P><P class="info-18">A2. The most important thing is to not provide  funding or facility to those people. For example, the researcher who has dubious funding sources or who ordered dangerous series of reagents might be surveyed. Also, the achievements and status as a researcher will be checked if they ordered synthesis of genes. In the U.S, when they have debts or criminal records, their applications will be rejected. </P><P class="info-18"> </P><P class="info-18">The lecture of an expert in biosafety taught us many things we have to pay attention to as a scientist. When we thought about the comment for the first question “it is necessary to find out whether the problem comes from the bacteria or the substances”, we came to the answer that the problem came from the bacteria we use. After this lecture, we gave close attention to the waste liquid treatment. When the waste included E. coli, we made sure it was thrown in the Biohazard waste bag. All the experiments were carried out with more than one person, so that we can check each other’s mistakes. 
                       From this approach , we were able to learn about the points scientists need to be aware of. We can say that this feedback gave many good effects for us. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P> </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV style="clear: both;"> </DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer-over"><P>© Tokyo Institute of Technology iGEM 2014</P></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
