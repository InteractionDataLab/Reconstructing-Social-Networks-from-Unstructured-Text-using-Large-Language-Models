You introduce allergen into the body in very small amounts, and by gradually increasing it, you can suppress the body′s hyper-allergic reaction. However, there are several defects in this treatment.

However, more than 70% of the fertilizer goes unused in soil. Phosphorus included in the fertilizer becomes insoluble by binding with metals, such as aluminum and calcium. Since plants cannot absorb these immobilized phosphorus, the phosphorus accumulates in the soil. To solve this problem, we decided to use E. coli to degrade the immobilized phosphorus into phosphoric acid, which plants can absorb. After producing phosphoric acid, E. coli stores it in its body in a polymeric form. By collecting these E. coli and extracting the polymer, we can retrieve the phosphorus left in the soil.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD height="19"><DIV align="center">Fig. 6-1-6.

However, they had doubts about the safety using genetically engineered creatures. Since those creatures do not exist in nature, we do not know what will happen when they are released into the wild. If something happens, it might take a long time to get the previous nature back. Many people have this fear of genetic engineering, and this leads to the bad image of synthetic biology. Based on these doubts, we explained to them the scientists’ measurements for safety. When we make a discovery, for example “iPS cells”, we consider if it is okay to use them for human or nature on a long-term basis. Just like inventing a new medicine, we have to test them on animals for more than ten years, and when the safety is secured, we decide to use them on human. </P><P class="info-18">By discussing with the principals, we were able to know the public mind toward synthetic biology. We feel this image is due to the ignorance of this field. If we can get more people informed of the reality of synthetic biology, maybe we can change the general opinion. We will continue interacting with a variety of people so that more and more people can learn about synthetic biology. </P><P class="info-18"> </P><P align="left" class="info-18"> </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P> </P><P> </P><DIV align="center" class="title-small">6.The Genetics Society of Japan</DIV><TABLE width="900" border="0"><TBODY><TR><TD colspan="2" class="info-18"> </TD></TR><TR><P class="info-18">We attended the 86th Annual Meeting of the Genetics Society of Japan. iGEM team Nagahama hosted this meeting, and 8 teams (HokkaidoU Japan, UT-Tokyo, Tokyo-Tech, TMU-Tokyo, Gifu, Kyoto, and Osaka) attended.

Our approaches to the questions we encountered</P><P class="info-18">Through the activities mentioned above, we  found two questions about our project. The first is whether the tool would be  really useful for understanding the economic system. The second is how we can solve  the safety problem (related  to commercialization.)</P><P class="info-18"> Our approaches to these problems were questionnaire  to students and interview to a biosafety specialist. 
            First, we sent out questionnaires to the students of Tokyo  Institute of Technology to confirm whether  our project would help the understanding of economic system. The results are (WHERE?) </P><P class="info-18">Second, we consulted the biosafety expert, Mr.  Tomoya Saito, who is working for National Institute of Public Health. He gave us a lecture on dual-use technology. After that, we asked him  some questions about biosafety. </P><P> </P><DIV align="center">Fig. 6-1-22. Our team member approaches to the problems</DIV><P> </P><P class="info-18"><STRONG>Q1. When we use bacteria that produces harmless  substances, does a biosafety or biosecurity problem arise? (Naoto)</STRONG></P><P class="info-18"><EM>A1. In that circumstance, it is necessary to  find out whether the problem comes from the bacteria or the substances. In  other words, the measurement against the problem differs depending on whether  the problem is biohazard or chemical hazard.</EM></P><P class="info-18"><STRONG>Q2. No matter how hard we try to keep  biosafety, there remains a probability that researchers themselves might abuse  the technology. How can we prevent that? (Riku)</STRONG></P><P class="info-18"><EM>A2. The most important thing is to not provide  funding or facility to those people. For example, the researcher who has  dubious funding sources or who ordered dangerous series of reagents might be surveyed.  Also, the achievements and status as a researcher will be checked if they ordered  synthesis of genes. In the U.S, when they have debts or criminal records, their  applications will be rejected. </EM></P><P class="info-18">By integrating both feedbacks from students  and the expert, we were able to conceive the idea. We were able to receive many feedbacks from our  two approaches. </P><P class="info-18"> First of all, by looking at the answers in the  questionnaire, we were able to have confidence that our project can help people  understand economic system better than before. Although we used several  scientific details related to synthetic biology, the project was understandable  for students without any knowledge of this field. Therefore, we can say that our  project, which is making an educational tool for iGEMers is effective and  practical for all students majoring science.</P><P align="left" class="info-18"><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Policy_and_Practices/Result_of_Analysis2">Click here too see the result</A></P><P class="info-18"> Secondly,  the lecture of an expert in biosafety taught us many things we have to pay  attention to as a scientist. When we thought about the comment for the first  question “it is necessary to find out whether the problem comes from the  bacteria or the substances”, we came to the answer that the problem came from  the bacteria we use. After this lecture, we gave close attention to the waste  liquid treatment. When the waste included E. coli, we made sure it was thrown  in the Biohazard waste bag. All the experiments were carried out with more than  one person, so that we can check each other’s mistakes. </P><P class="info-18"> From  these two approaches, we were able to see our educational tool’s effect and  learn about the points scientists need to be aware of. We can say that these  feedbacks gave many good effects for us.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV style="clear: both;"> </DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer-over"><P>© Tokyo Institute of Technology iGEM 2014</P></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
