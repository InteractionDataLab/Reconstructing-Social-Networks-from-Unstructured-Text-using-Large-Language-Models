1. Introduction
 
In the modeling (Fig. 3-1-1-1), the better mutualism between Company and Customer requires that the expression of LasI under the control of Prhl promoter ( BBa_R0071 ) is the same level as the expression of RhlI under the control of Plux  promoter ( BBa_R0062 ). Thus, we firstly tested the expression level of Prhl promoter and Plux promoter through the reporter assay (Fig. 3-1-1-2).

2. Summary of the Experiment
 
Our purpose is to confirm the expression level of Prhl promoter ( BBa_R0071 ) and Plux promoter ( BBa_R0062 ). We prepared two plasmids sets shown in below (Fig. 3-1-2-1). We measured the fluorescence intensity by GFP expression when we added signaling molecules.
We prepared four conditions shown in below.
A-1: Culture containing Ptet-LuxR and Plux-GFP cell with 3OC12HSL
     A-2: Culture containing Ptet-LuxR and Plux-GFP cell with DMSO
     B-1: Culture containing Ptet-RhlR and Prhl-GFP cell with C4HSL
     B-2: Culture containing Ptet-RhlR and Prhl-GFP cell with DMSO

Fig. 3-1-3-1 shows our experimental data of Plux promoter and Prhl promoter. Compared with the modeling results, the expression level of the native BioBrick Prhl promoter ( BBa_R0071 ) was too weak to satisfy our requirement (Fig. 3-1-3-1 lane 2).  In other words, the expression of RhlI under the control of Plux promoter ( BBa_R0062 ) was higher than the expression of LasI under the control of Prhl promoter.

4-2. Assay Protocol
1. Prepare 2 overnight cultures for each sample  in 3 mL LB medium, containing ampicillin (50 microg /                      mL) and kanamycin (30 microg / mL) at 37°C for 12 h.
2. Dilute the overnight cultures to 1 / 100 in fresh LB medium (3 mL) containing ampicillin (50 microg /                              mL) and kanamycin (30 microg / mL) (fresh culture).
3. Incubate the fresh cultures at 37°C until the OD590 reaches 0.3.
4. Add 30 microL of 500 microM C4HSL, 500 nM 3OC12HSL or DMSO as listed below:
   A-1: A + 500 nM 3OC12HSL
       A-2: A + DMSO
       B-1: B +500 microM C4HSL
       B-2: B + DMSO
5. Incubate the samples at 37°C for 4 h.
6. Start preparing the flow cytometer 1 h before the end of incubation.
7. Take 200 microL of the sample, and centrifuge at 9000x g, 1 min, 4°C.
8. Remove the supernatant by using P1000 pipette.
9. Add 1 mL of filtered PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) and suspend.
10. Dispense all of each suspension into a disposable tube through a cell strainer.
11. Measure the fluorescence intensity with a flow cytometer (We used BD FACSCaliburTM Flow Cytometer of Becton, Dickenson and Company).
