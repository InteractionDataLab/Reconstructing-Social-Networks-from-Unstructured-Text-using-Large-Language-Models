We are proud to say that all the ideas we worked on this year were proposed by undergraduate members of our team Tokyo_Tech 2014. Moreover, the whole experimental data created by our team comes from experiments all carried out by undergraduates. The project "Bank E. coli" was proposed by Naoto Takahashi. Modeling related to this project was done by Takuya Kato and Ye Kai. We want to thank every advisers and instructors who helped us with discussing these ideas and guided us in the experiments.

Contribution
 
General Support
 
Prof. Kiga let us use his lab for all of our experiments. He also has led many Tokyo Tech teams to the excellent results in iGEM since this competition has started.
Prof. Yamamura and Prof. Konagaya supported us in many ways to give us a better researching environment. 
Prof. Ayukawa supported us in all of our experiments throughout the preparations for iGEM.
Promega KK provided us a part of the restriction enzyme we used without any charge.
 
Instrumental Analysis Support
 
Biomaterial Analysis Center, Technical Department, checked the sequence of the plasmids which we had asked.
 
Policy and Practice Support
 
Tomoya Saito, who is working for National Institute of Public Health, gave us a lecture on dual-use technologies, and gave us useful advice about biosafety.
Hiromichi Ando arranged MUSE TALK and let us present there.
Akihiro Hiyoshi, who is the principal of Ohyamaguchi Elementary School , gave us a chance to communicate with students.
