Improved and New Parts
We  constructed new Prhl promoter by improving the original Prhl promoter ( BBa_R0071 ).

By changing RhlR binding site and LuxR binding site, we  designed Prhl(RL) promoter ( BBa_K1529300 ),  Prhl(LR) promoter ( BBa_K1529310 )  and Prhl(RR) promoter ( BBa_K1529320 ).We think (BBa_K1529300) is a improved part and (BBa_K1529310) and  (BBa_K1529320) are new parts.We are sure that we made a big contribution to the iGEM and iGEMer by the construction of new Prhl promoter.
Other new parts are Prhl(RL)-CmR-LasI( BBa_K1529302 ) and Plux-CmR-RhlI( BBa_K1529797 ).

Policy and Practice
Our  team went beyond what is normally expected from iGEM teams in terms of policy & practices. We had much interactions to discuss modulate course of our  project with the general public.
For  example, our team members and iGEM Tokyo_Tech 2013 veterans gave a  presentation at a workshop called “MUSE TALK”.  Managers, executives and technicians working in IT companies  participated in this event to learn about things outside their specialty.

After the presentation, many audiences were impressed with  the technology of synthetic biology, and acknowledged it as a research which  estimates future prospects.
