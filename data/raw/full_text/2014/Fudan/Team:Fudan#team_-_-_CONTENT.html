Glad to meet everyone in this specific way. In iGEM, my job was to design the project. It was not easy to come up a great achievable idea. After years of reading paper and experimenting, I finally can handle the whole program. Me myself is a huge fun of board game, especially The killer of Three Kingdoms. If any iGEMer has interest, I can teach you in person!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="testimonial_text"><DIV class="col-sm-9"><H2>Xin Ge</H2><H3>Student</H3><P>I am Ge Xin and glad to meet all the iGEM friends! I changed my major from biology to advertisement recently. So I am in charge of a part of wiki and some human practice. In the spare time, watching American TV show is my favorite way to relax. And I am a huge Marvel fan! Can’t wait to meet other iGEMer Marvel fan!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="testimonial_text"><DIV class="col-sm-9"><H2>Fei Jin</H2><H3>Student</H3><P>I am a junior majoring in life science with special interest in epigenetic and my name is Jin Fei. In the past 10 month I put most of my time on the IGEM and was response to the cell group. My main work consisted of cell direct conversion from MEF to neuron with two other team members. Talking about hobbies, some computer game and sports are good ways to relax. Most importantly killing cells in a variety ways is my biggest interest now.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="testimonial_text"><DIV class="col-sm-9"><H2>Yilin Li</H2><H3>Student</H3><P>Hello! I'm Li Yilin, a student from college of life science, not a professional researcher but the one who put all our plan of human practice into reality. In addition, I contact companies to get sponsorship or to gain professional. I’m also the one in charge of our team finance.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="testimonial_text"><DIV class="col-sm-9"><H2>Hanyu Pan</H2><H3>Student</H3><P>Hey, I am Pan Hanyu and i am a junior student majoring in the life science in Fudan University. It is a great honor to meet other iGEMer around world. I was worked with my friends Yang Heqing and Niu Yichi. Before joining this team. I don’t have much experiment experience. In the team, I have learned a lot and gained valuable experience. Working with other people courage me to improve myself. Outside of lad, I love to watch Korean TV show and play card games.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="testimonial_text"><DIV class="col-sm-9"><H2>Jinkai Wan</H2><H3>Student</H3><P>As a junior student in Fudan University, I chose biology to be my lifelong major and I am Wan Jinkai. I worked in the cell group and my main duty is to culture cells. I spent most of my time in the lab and in the car between two campus. It’s a wonderful experience while working in team. In my spare time, my favorite thing is work out. I spent a lot of time in gym and I hope to have a fit body.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="testimonial_text"><DIV class="col-sm-9"><H2>Xuanye Cao</H2><H3>Student</H3><P>Hello everyone,this is Cao Xuanye. I am a junior year biology major with experience working and great social ability. As a leader of our team, I played a significant role in the part of design and experiment. However science is not my whole life, in the spare time, I am a violinist. Thanks to the IGEM, I met my girlfriend and it’s romantic to run this team with her.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="testimonial_text"><DIV class="col-sm-9"><H2>Heqing Yang</H2><H3>Student</H3><P>I'm a junior in the School of Life Science, Fudan University. I work on starting and running our team with Cao Xuanye. During this summer, I focus on the work related with molecular cloning operation, such as the construction of TET induced expression system and Cre/loxP system. It has been a really intense but exciting time, for I cherish more about the process of the experiment than the result. The challenges we face every time often motivate me to think more. I'm rather interested in the way life operates, and eager to figure out how it works, finally to make a life act in the way we designed. Outside of the lab, I enjoy ball games and jogging. I'd like to make friends and exchange ideas with iGEMers all over the world.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="testimonial_text"><DIV class="col-sm-9"><H2>Siyu Xiao</H2><H3>Student</H3><P>As the only sophomore in this team, I am Xiao Siyu.

My main job is human practice and run an organization about iGEM in Fudan. In this team, I learned a lot from others about experiment, design and even run a team.
