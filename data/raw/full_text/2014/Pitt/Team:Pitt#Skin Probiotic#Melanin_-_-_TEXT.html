Skin Pigment
The natural tendency for P. acnes to reside in the skin makes P. acnes an ideal candidate for a skin-probiotic. Using the transformation protocol optimized by our team, we can insert novel genes for beneficent functions into P. acnes. One such function is to secrete human skin pigment, which would serve as a “natural” sunscreen and potential insect repellent.
Melanin A (MelA) is an enzyme that converts and polymerizes quinone into the large, aromatic Melanin constructs capable of absorbing skin damaging UV light. By incorporating MelA into P. acnes, we hope to create a natural and self-sustainable sunscreen by using a bacteria that is naturally found on the skin. Furthermore, the precursor to melanin, 1,2-benzoquinone, has been shown to repel mosquitos.
