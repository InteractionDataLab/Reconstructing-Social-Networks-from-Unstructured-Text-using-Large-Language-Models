Tailgate
With the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (the same group that brought you SciencePalooza), we presented a module named “Enzyme Time” at a Pitt football game tailgate. The module aimed to teach the general public about the action and importance of enzymes and bring awareness to our research.
On October 16th, 2014, 3 of our team members presented the module to attendees of a Pitt football game. The audience included a wide range of people of all ages and backgrounds. We were able to demonstrate the activity of enzymes using a basic experiment with saltine crackers and iodine. Our module was well-received and we had a great time experimenting in a new and exciting setting!
