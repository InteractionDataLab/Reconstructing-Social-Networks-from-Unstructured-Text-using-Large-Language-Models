These values were chosen carefully from reading through current literature on <I>P. acnes</I> and other electroporation protocols. The 8 parameters were:</P><P><U>P. Acnes strain</U></P><P>We chose to use two different types of <I>P. Acnes</I> strains to determine if this made a significant difference in the transformation efficiency. We did however restrict the strain to being dam- strains because unmethylated DNA was shown to have greater transformation efficiency (Cheong). In addition, Type I <I>P. Acnes</I> was used because there is CRISPR/Cas system in this class. This system protects <I>p. Acnes</I> against plasmid and foreign DNA.</P><P><U>Lysozyme concentration</U></P><P>Since, <I>P. Acnes</I> has a particularly thick cell wall, lysozyme was used as a cell wall weakening agent. Lysozyme is a common cell wall weakening agent and was readily available. The concentrations were determined from previous experiments in lab with <I>P. Acnes</I>.</P><P><U>Glycine concentration</U></P><P>Similar to the lysozyme, glycine was used as a cell wall weakening agent. The concentrations were determined from a paper which transformed other <I>P. Acnes</I> bacteria. (Fan)</P><P><U>Mass of plasmid DNA</U></P><P>The high and low values for this parameter were based of values suggested by a protocol written by UCLA and a protocol by Cheong.</P><CENTER><P><A href="http://lrrpublic.cli.det.nsw.edu.au/lrrSecure/Sites/Web/Forces_and_fields_creative_commons/7304/7304_01.htm">Source</A></P></CENTER><P><U>Electric field strength</U></P><P>The values for electric field strength were chosen based of the Cheong paper. </P><P><U>Culture temperature</U></P><P>We decided to use 24°C because this was the lower end of culture temperature that growth was seen by Cheong. We determined 37°C to be the higher end of the spectrum because this is body temperature. </P><P><U>Post-transformation temperature</U></P><P>We chose the post transformation incubation temperatures for the same reason as the culture temperature.</P><CENTER><P><A href="http://www.dreamstime.com/photos-images/goal-thermometer.html">Source</A></P></CENTER><P><U>Presence of restriction enzyme inhibitor (TypeOne)</U></P><P>This particular product was shown to increase the efficiency of transformation by inhibiting type 1 restriction modification systems. Although, there is no confirmed evidence for a type 1 restriction/modification system in <I>P. Acnes</I></P><P>Testing for these 8 parameters required 16 trials, the values of which can be seen below:</P><P><B>Trials</B></P><P>For each trial, the desired <I>P. acnes</I> strain was grown up in approximately 30 mL of A media until attaining an optical density (OD) of at least 0.5. Once at this OD, a specified concentration of glycine was added for a day, then competent cells were made. </P><P>The procedure for making competent cells first involved cleaning the bacteria by centrifuging with 10% glycerol buffer. The bacteria was then soaked in 15% glycerol buffer with varying concentration of lysozyme for 2 hours, then was washed again and frozen with dry ice in 50 uL aliquots of 10% glycerol buffer.</P><P>Before electroporation, the competent cells were thawed and a specified amount of our desired plasmid (pBRESP36a) was added. At this time, TypeOne restriction enzyme inhibitor was also added for half of the trials. Electroporation then ensued with a set value of electric field strength, after which the bacteria was recovered.</P><P>Recovering the bacteria involved letting it grow overnight in 500 uL of A media, then streaking it on A media plates with erythromycin in it. Because of the pBRESP36a, our bacteria would be erythromycin resistant. After a week of growth on the plates, the colonies of bacteria were counted and validated.</P><P><B>Validation</B></P><P>Validating the colonies consisted of ensuring that the bacteria on the plate was erythromycin resistant and that it contained the plasmid, and validating that the bacteria was <I>P. acnes</I>.</P><P>To check that the bacterial genome contained our target plasmid, several transformed colonies were restreaked on plates containing erythromycin, then a colony PCR was performed. </P><P>To ensure that the bacteria was <I>P. acnes</I> and not some form of contamination, a P. acnes phage was used on a plate with top agar that contained the bacteria.</P><H2>Timeline</H2><CENTER><P style="font-size:250%"><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Pitt/Notebook"><B>Lab Notebook</B></A></P></CENTER><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Pitt/Protocol_Design/Results"><DIV class="next_page"><P>Next Page</P></DIV></A><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Pitt/Protocol_Design/Intro"><DIV class="prev_page"><P>Previous Page</P></DIV></A></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
