Results and Conclusions for HSP60
We successfully cloned the Hsp60 promoter and RBS from M. Bovis and bacteriophage TM4, respectfully, which we expect to function in P. acnes. While waiting for the protocol to be developed for transformation of P. acnes with plasmid DNA, we tested whether the promoter would be functional in E. coli, by assaying expression of the mRFP1 protein.  The hsp60 promoter was cloned upstream of the B0034 RBS and mRFP1 gene comprising the part Part: BBa_K1548002 as pictured in Figure 2.

We found that the hsp60 promoter was not functional in E. coli as it did not lead to mRFP1 production.

We then ran an E. coli promoter prediction software BPROM on ( http://linux1.softberry.com/berry.phtml?topic=bprom&group=programs&subgroup=gfindb ) which validated our result that the promoter was non-functional in E. coli. We are confident that the promoter will be highly active in P. acnes based on experiments performed in closely related bacteria in Ref. 1. Once we optimize the transformation of P. acnes we can test the efficacy of this promoter in P. acnes.
