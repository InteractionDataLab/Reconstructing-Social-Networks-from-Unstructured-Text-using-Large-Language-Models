Safety
What are the biosafety guidelines of your institution?
http://www.ibc.pitt.edu/RiskGroups/RiskBiosafetyChart2007.htm

Risks: Standard risks associated with BSL1 bacteria: low risk of human infection, but potential hazards from chemical spills. Negligible risks to the general public. Negligible environmental risks, besides improper disposal of chemicals. Negligible risk from mis-use.
Risk Reduction: We are maintaining safe lab practices to avoid spills, and using only BSL1 organisms.
Potential New Risks: If successfully engineered, the P. acnes bacterium could pose a risk by taking up residence on the skin of individuals working in the lab. An especially viable strain of P. acnes could replace other skin bacteria and begin expressing harmful genes. If the knowledge to transform P. acnes became widely available, then malicious groups could mis-use P. acnes as an infectious agent, spread through skin-skin contact.
Potential Risk Reduction: In the future, extra laboratory precautions would be taken to avoid skin exposure when working with engineered P. acnes. A kill switch or genetic fence may also be engineered to contain loose strains of P. acnes.
Labs
Location: 523 Langley Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15213
Supervisor: Dr. Paula Grabowski
Bio-Safety Level: 1
Cleared Strains: Escherichia coli
Work Environment: Open benches, laminar flow hood
Protective Equipment: Lab coats, gloves, safety goggles
Waste Disposal: Pipette tips and agar plates are disposed of in a designated bio-hazard bin. Agar gels are placed in solid chemical waste containers underneath a chemical hood. Liquid cultures are sterilized with bleach, and drained into a chemical sink.

Who is responsible for biological safety at your institution?
At the University of Pittsburgh, there exists an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), who is responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with NIH Guidelines on all activities that involve recombinant DNA (rDNA) including gene therapy. We have not discussed our project with them.
