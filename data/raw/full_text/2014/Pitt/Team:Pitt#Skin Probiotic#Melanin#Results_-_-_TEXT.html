Results and Conclusions for MelA
Upon receiving the MelA part from the registry we prepped and digested it with XbaI and PstI. The digest revealed the part was not in the vector. In the future we can synthesize the MelA gene to clone it into our system behind the hsp60 promoter to lead to melA and thus melanin production on the skin.
