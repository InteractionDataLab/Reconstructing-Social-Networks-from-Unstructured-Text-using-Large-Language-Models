SciencePalooza
Our activity
We developed a community outreach module, “Dermalicious,” to teach middle-school children about the structure and proper care of the skin. After an interactive worksheet, the exercise culminates in a candy model, where layers of the skin are represented by marshmallows, fruit sheets, and licorice.
On July 31st, 2014, the Pitt iGEM Team presented the Dermalicious module to a gathering of underprivileged middle-school children at Pitt’s annual Science Palooza event, sponsored by the Clinical & Translational Science Institute. In this day-long event, about 500 middle-school children rotate through 30-minute stations, where they learn about all different areas of science – the Pitt iGEM Team was excited to add “Skin Health” to this list of subjects.
The participants, aged 8-12, were asked for their feedback on the module and gave our team a 100% satisfaction rating!
