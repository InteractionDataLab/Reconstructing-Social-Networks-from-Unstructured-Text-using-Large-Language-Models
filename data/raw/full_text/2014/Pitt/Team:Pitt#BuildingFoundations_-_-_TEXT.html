The experimental section of our project consisted of three main parts:
Optimizing a transformation protocol for a new strain of bacteria - Propionibacterium acnes.
Isolate a strong, constitutive promoter from Mycobacteria smegmentis for use in future P. acnes parts.
Reapply several BioBrick  parts to a new plasmid backbone for use in P. acnes as a skin probiotic.
