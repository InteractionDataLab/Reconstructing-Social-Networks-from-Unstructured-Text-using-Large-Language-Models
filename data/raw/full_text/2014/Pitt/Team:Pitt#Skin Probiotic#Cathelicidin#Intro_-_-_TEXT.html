Cathelicidin Introduction
The objective of this part of the project was to engineer P. Acnes already on our skin to produce an anti-microbial peptide, which would reduce inflammation by inhibiting local bacteria growth. We chose Cathelicidin as our anti-microbial peptide because it is a natural antibiotic produced by the immune cells of many mammals, including humans.
A key factor of this construct was making sure that the cathelicidin production was not constitutive, leading to the death of all bacteria and destruction of our skin’s natural biome. Therefore, we decided to combine the cathelicidin production with the YF1/FixJ and FixK2 blue light induction system. This allows regulation of cathelicidin production by blue light, giving the means to suppress the P. Acnes when, and only when, it becomes elevated.
When designing this system, four main parts were going to be objectives:
hsp60 (no RBS) – mRFP1
This objective of this part was to test the novel promoter hsp60 with the fluorescence of mRFP1.
Blue Promoter (FixK2) – (RBS) mRFP1 – hsp60 (no RBS) – Blue Sensor (YF1/FixJ)
The objective of this part was to test the blue light system with hsp60 and mRFP1. Hsp60 would cause constitutive production of the Blue Light Sensor (YF1/FixJ), which in turn, would cause the Blue Light Promoter to cause production of mRFP1 when exposed to blue light.
Blue Promoter – (RBS) mRFP1 – Cathelicidin – Terminator – hsp60 (no RBS) – Blue Sensor
The objective of this part was to test the entire system. Hsp60 would cause constitutive production of the Blue Light Sensor. When exposed to blue light, the Blue Light Promoter would activate and cause production of mRFP1 and Cathelicidin. It could therefore be expected that if the cells fluoresced red, that Cathelicidin was being produced.
Blue Promoter – RBS – Cathelicidin – Terminator – hsp60 (no RBS) – Blue Sensor
This part would be the final product. If the three previous tests were successful, then this part could be expected to produce Cathelicidin when exposed to blue light. This function, without the mRFP1, would be the optimal product to apply to P. Acnes on peoples' skin.
