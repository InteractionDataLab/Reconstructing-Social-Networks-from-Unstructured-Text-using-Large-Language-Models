Methods for MelA
Upon receiving the MelA part BBa_K193602 we transformed them into Mach1 cells, mini-prepped the plasmid and performed a diagnostic digest for the part. As can be seen in Figure # below no MelA part was observed indicating an issue with the iGEM stock of these parts. At this point we had to put this project on hold.
Figure 2. Gel of BBa_K193602 expected to contain melA with XbaI and PstI shows that the expected insert band (1896bp) is not present.
