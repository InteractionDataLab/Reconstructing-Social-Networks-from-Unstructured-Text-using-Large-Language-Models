Blog and Crowdfunding
In an effort to raise funds for the 2014 Giant Jamboree, the Pitt iGEM Team used  Experiment.com  to crowd-fund our project. Our project, entitled  Living Skin Therapeutics, was successful in raising $2063, 108% of our goal! We attribute our success to a carefully crafted campaign plan including videos, updates on research progress, and blog posts that supplemented our campaign. We of course couldn’t have done it without the continued support of the Experiment.com team! Our campaign ended with traffic from 142 sources and 1681 page views!
The Pitt iGEM Team also shares a passion for writing, and we maintain a blog over at  igempitt.wordpress.com, where we offer tips and tricks we have learned while living in the lab and navigating the iGEM world. Our blog currently has 263 page views and visitors from 12 countries!
