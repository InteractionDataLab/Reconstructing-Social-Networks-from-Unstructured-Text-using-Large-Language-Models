Future Application
Purpose
Via successful application of detecting module and recycling module above, we achieved the goal that our engineering bacteria displayed the  presence of Cd2+ and synthesized nanocrystals. However, there is  another problem coming, the 2nd pollution committed by bacterium  themselves spreading limits the future application of our Units and conceals the function of recycling module. In our opinion, the rapid flocculation of our engineering bacteria is  viable in avoiding this bottleneck and helpful in collecting the solid  contaminant. As reported, flocculating system was capable to increase the flocculent activity of the bacteria, a flocculation gene was tentatively adopted  in our next work. In this section, our host bacteria containing a flocculation  gene cloned from Bacillus sp.  F2 was presented and tested.
Strains, media and plasmids
The Bacillus sp. F2 [1] that was  used in this study was stored at -40°C in 20% glycerol. The bacteria from  the stock cultures were pre-cultured in Luria-Bertani culture medium (LB) prior to  use. DH5α was taken as the host for  recombinant plasmids. The pET-28b (+) was prepared as an overexpression vector  to produce the target protein. Rosetta  pLysS was used as the host for expression of the flocculation gene under  the control of the T7 promoter. E. coli transformants were grown at 37°C in LB medium.
Cloning and overexpression of the flocculation gene in E. coli.
The  extraction of total DNA from the strain of Bacillus sp. F2 was carried out according to standard  techniques. The putative flocculation activity gene was amplified from the  total DNA by using the primers introduced HindIII and NdeI restriction sites  for cloning to the pET-28b (+). The following primers were used: F, 5'  GGAATTCCATATGATGAGTCTACTTGCTGTTTTGTTTT3'. R,5'AAGGGGTTATGCTAGTTACGAATTCGAGCTC3' [2]. After sequencing, the positive PCR  product was digested with NdeI /HindIII and then ligated into NdeI/HindIII-treated  expression vector pET-28b (+) and transformed into Rosetta pLysS. The E. coli cells  transformed with this plasmid were plated on LB agar containing 100 μg/ml  Kanamycin. The transformant was grown in a 100-ml flask containing 10 ml LB  medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml Kanamycin at 37°C until the optical density  at 600 nm reached to 0.6–1.0, and then 0.8 mM IPTG were added to induce target  protein expression. After incubation at 37°C for more than 8 h with shaking at  200 rpm, cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000g for 5 min at 4°C) and  washed twice with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH7.0), and the cell pellet was  stored at −20°C for further use.
Preparation of biomass
Cells were incubated at 37°C on  an orbital shaker at 150 rpm for 24 h. After growth, cells were harvested by  centrifugation (6000g, 5 min), washed two times with 30 mM  ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution. Subsequently, cells were  washed twice with deionised water. Then the cells were resuspended in phosphate  buffer (10 mM, pH 7.0).
Measurement of ability.
The sedimentation ability was evaluated under standard  conditions. Briefly, cells suspensions were placed in a 25 ml cylinder, at 5 g  dry weight L-1 in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.0), containing 4 mM  Ca2+. Then, the sediment ability of the E.coil strain was tested in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.0). At  defined periods of time, samples were taken from a fixed position of the  cylinder (the level corresponding to 20 ml) and dispersed in 30 mM EDTA  solution. Cell concentration after a t time (Ct) was determined by measuring the absorbance of the  suspension at 600 nm. Calibration curves (absorbance versus either number of  cells or dry weight) were previously constructed.
In order to determine the initial cell concentration,  5 g dry weight L-1 of cell suspensions were placed in 30 mM EDTA  solution, in a 25 ml cylinder. The suspensions were agitated. Samples were  taken and diluted in 30 mM EDTA solution, before absorbance was determined at  600 nm (Ci).
The % of settled cells (%SC) was calculated by the  following equation: %SC=100–(Ct / Ci) ×100,  where Ci is  the initial cell concentration and Ct is the cell concentration  in suspension after t time [3].
Result
For comparative purposes, two E.coli strains with or without flocculation gene  were used. The results were shown in Fig. 1. It was showed that the control  strain could not settle efficiently within a short time. After 20 min static placement, only 55% of cells were flocculated. In contrast, the  recombinant strain was strongly flocculent, 70% of cells were flocculated  within only 10 min. At last, about 80% of the cells were settled after 20 min.  The results indicated that the flocculation gene was expressed successfully in  the E.coli strain. The flocculation  ability of the recombinant strain  could give us a new sight to remove cells from liquid environment. However, we  only observed the flocculation characters of the strain in phosphate  buffer containing 4 mM Ca2+, and we did not test the flocculation ability of the strain in the waste water which contains  various metal ions and organic pollutant, and that is what we will  focus on in our further study.

Conclusion
In total, this work supported our project with  convenience in enriching the nanocrystals and reliability against secondary  pollution. Eventually, we can realize our double-win goal, safeguarding our  environment by removing heavy metal ions and yielding available nanocrystals.  However, this work was limited in the laboratory.
