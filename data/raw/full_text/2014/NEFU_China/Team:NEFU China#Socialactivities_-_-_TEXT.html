Discussing with previous iGEMers
April 13rd 2014
We invited two previous iGEMers from Zhejiang University(Zukai Liu) and Natinal Chiao Tung University(Haoxian Wang) to share a lot of experiences, feelings and lessons for joining the iGEM competition with us, such as the experience of building a team, selecting a track and running a project. We have obtained much information about iGEM from them. As new iGEMers, it was really a great encouragement for us. Meanwhile, we got prepared for the iGEM competition as they suggested, such as scheduling for weekly group meetings.
C3-B3 2014 International Workshop and Summer school on “Biological Bytes” and iGEM Meet-Up
August 17-23rd 2014
We attended an International Workshop and Summer School on "Biological Big Bytes", a Satellite Meeting of the International Workshop/Summer school on Crops, Chips & Computers(short for C3-B3). It was combined with the iGEM Meet-Up for three teams in Harbin, China(HIT-Harbin, NEAU-Harbin and us) and it was organized by Harbin Institute of Technology. In this international conference, we asked and discussed biological questions with foreigner professors. More importantly, it was combined with the iGEM Meet-Up for three teams in Harbin, giving us a great opportunity to share our projects and experiences with other teams and also letting us to hear the wonderful thoughts and ideas from them. The meet-up truly promoted communications between iGEMers. Here we express our sincere thanks for them!
VISITING SEWAGE PLANT
August 28th 2014
We visited Harbin Taiping sewage treatment plant to learn some knowledge related to technological process of sewage treatment, and we gained a more thorough and deeper awareness of the polluted water as well. Besides, we also collected some sewage samples from the sewage treatment plant in order to test our system to find out how our Units can be applied better.
