Biosafety
Overview
All of NEFU_China members completed safety training before the start of our project. The programs about safety training can be found here: http://dept.nefu.edu.cn/life/list/?227_1.html .(Chinese version). The Laboratory Biosafety Manual published by WHO has provided practical guidance for us. We work in a BSL1 lab equipped well to meet the safety criteria.
Q&A Section
Q1. Please describe the chassis orgamisms you will be using in your project.

Q3. Risks to the safety and health of team members or others working in the lab?
We worked in a BSL1 lab and all of us had received the safety training. We have worked out an emergency package.
Q4. What safety training have you received?
In July, we completed Laboratory Biosafety Manual, Chemical/Fire/Electrical safety trainings before the start of our wet lab work. You can get more information here: http://dept.nefu.edu.cn/life/list/?227_1.html (Chinese version)               If you have any questions, please contact us.
Q5. Risks to the security through malicious misuse by individuals, groups, or countries?
The biological materials we used have no menace and we have effective measures to prevent someone from misusing.
Q6. If your project moved from a small-scale lab study to become widely used as a commercial/industrial product, what new risks might arise? Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
Our project includes special feature to reduce this risk. The flocculation module was designed to carry our project forward to commercial/industrial product.
Q7. Does your country have national biosafety regulations or guidelines? If so, please provide a link to these regulations or guidelines if possible.
Here you can see our national biosafety regulations and guidelines: http://www.stee.agri.gov.cn/biosafety (Chinese version)               If you have any questions, please contact us.
