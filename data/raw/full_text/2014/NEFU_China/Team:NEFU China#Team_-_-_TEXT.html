Students
Tong Li
Grade:Senior
Attribution:He is the leader of NEFU team for iGEM 2014. He devotes to designing gene CP25 and Flocculation.He manages the communication between advisers and students in and out of the team and other public affairs. He’s also in charge of the laboratory safety management. He always looks at the bright side and encourages his crew.
Yajing Li
Grade:Senior
Attribution:As a members of NEFU team for iGEM 2014, she is responsible for doing the human practice. To be more specific, she helps to formulate the questionnaire and analyzes the data collected by the questionnaire. Moreover, she also participates in other wet lab work.
Zhi Li
Grade:Senior
Attribution:She is one of the members of NEFU team for iGEM 2014. She is in charge of financial affairs and is responsible for the detection of the Cd ions.At the same time,she manages the further development for the iGEM encyclopedia as well as helps maintain the operation of the laboratory.
Zhiqi Liu
Grade:Senior
Attribution: As a members of NEFU team for iGEM 2014,she’s responsible for the construction of the designed plasmids about BCP. As a good technician, She takes the experimental diary and do some technique trainings to make sure the procedure of each respect of the experiment and promote the experimental quality.
Baojie Lv
Grade:Junior
Attribution:She is one of the members in NEFU team for iGEM 2014. She is an excellent primer designer and takes charge of the sequencing works. Her approval of the primary genes is essential for the subsequent experiments. As a junior student, she has a strong thirst for knowledge and is always hard-working through all the project.
Danhui Ma
Grade:Senior
Attribution:She is one of the members in NEFU team for iGEM 2014. As a senior, she takes charge of the safety training and the daily maintenance of all equipment in laboratory. She is outstanding in theoretical foundation and contributes to the design of the parallel program.
Yuwei Sun
Grade:Junior
Attribution:As a member of NEFU team for iGEM 2014. The expression of the interested proteins in each vital step of the project attributes a lot to her dedication. She’s in charge of the SDS-PAGE through all the project. Her steady performance in the wet lab is a great example of others.
Heming Wang
Grade:Junior
Attribution:He is one of the members in NEFU team for iGEM 2014. As an efficient practitioner, he is responsible for the standardization and submission of all our unique parts, shifting the parts into pSB1C3 and send them out. He also takes charge of the storage of the strains, plasmids and all needed chemical reagents.
Li Yao
Grade:Sophomore
Attribution:Wiki design
He Zhang
Grade:Senior
Attribution:As a member of NEFU team for iGEM 2014. She takes charge of the construction works of designed plasmids and the experiments related to BRP and contributes to the structure of the project. At the same time, she is responsible for the detection of the Cd ions. She’s a warmest helper and hardest worker in the team.
Weixuan Zhao
Grade:Senior
Attribution:He is one of the members of NEFU team for iGEM 2014. As a student majored in mathematics and applied mathematics, he is responsible for designing our mathematical modeling and a part of data analysis.
Xin Zhao
Grade:Junior
Attribution:She is one of the members in NEFU team for iGEM 2014. As a junior student, she is a fast learner. She assists Yuwei to complete the expression work of the interested proteins,and also helps to circulate and check the questionnaires.
