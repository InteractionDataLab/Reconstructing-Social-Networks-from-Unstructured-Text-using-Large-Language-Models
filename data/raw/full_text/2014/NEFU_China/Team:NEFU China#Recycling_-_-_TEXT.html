TEM Protocol.
In order  to verify the synthesis of the CdS nanocrystal in E.coli (Rosetta  plysS), the bacteria was harvested by centrifuged  in 3000*g for 3 min then suspended in resin and hardened at 60℃ for 16 hours.
Then the hard pellets were cut into 60nm thin slices and the slices were floated on water and deposited on a carbon-coated copper TEM grid. Microscopy was performed with a JEM-1400 microscope at 80-keV electron energy.
