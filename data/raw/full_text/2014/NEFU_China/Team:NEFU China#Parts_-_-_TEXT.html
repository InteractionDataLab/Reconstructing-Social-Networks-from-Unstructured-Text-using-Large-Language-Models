For Detecting
BBa_K1509000
This is a new coding region part. It encodes smtB protein that functions as a trans-acting regulator and binds at two inverted repeats in smt operator/promoter sites, a bi-directional promoter. In the original intact smt locus, this interaction leads to the repression of the gene smtA, orientated in the opposite direction of the gene smtB. Previous cases selected smtA whose product functions by encoding MT-like protein that can sequester metal ions to deplete heavy metal ions from environment, while we take advantage of the interaction between SmtB protein and smt operator/promoter, the bi-directional promoter. This part is essential for our designed function of detection. With BBa_K1509001 (smt operator/promoter), it’s the core member of the cadmium sensor.
BBa_K1509001
This is a bi-directional promoter, a new non-coding region part. It contains two inverted repeats that are the binding sites of SmtB protein. And the activity of one direction of this promoter can be repressed after the interaction with SmtB protein. With BBa_K1509000 (the gene smtB), it’s the core member of the cadmium sensor.
For Recycling
BBa_K1509003
This is a constitutive strong promoter, a new non-coding region part. The promoter was designated as CP25. CP25 is a stronge promoter in Lactococcus lactis.(Jensen and Hammer, 1998) In this article, they measured the activities of the CP promoters in E. coli and assayed the expression of a reporter gene(lacLM) to rank the activities of those CP promoters. The result suggests CP25 is the strongest promoter. We picked it and insert it upstream of the gene CDS7( BBa_K643000 ), a part registered by Columbia-Cooper in 2011 iGEM competition, to make sure the gene CDS7 can be transcript constantly.
For Flocculating
BBa_K1509002
This is a new coding region part. It is responsible for the flocculent ability of Bacillus sp. F2 and has been converted to E. coli JM109. It has been proved that strain of E. coli positive clone FC2 could express flocculent activity, with the flocculent efficiency of 90%, thus can be a good choice in environmental applications.(Guangyu Chang et al., 2007) The 1071bp gene consists of 29% T, 18% C, 25% G and 29% A. Considering the subsequent treatment of our reconstructed bacteria, we use this gene to enhance the flocculent activity of our bacteria. This is to make it easier to collect nanocrystals formed by our bacteria and also a second thought of the problem of secondary pollution. It’s very promising in future application.
