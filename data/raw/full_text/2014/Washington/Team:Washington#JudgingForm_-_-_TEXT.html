iGEM Medals for Foundational Advance Teams
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2014 Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. Please see the iGEM 2011 Imperial College Acknowledgements page for an example.

Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. Please see the Registry help page on adding new parts. A new application and/or outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part's/ Device's function) of a previously existing BioBrick part also counts. Please see the Registry help page on how to document your contributions. To fulfill this criteria, you will also need to submit the part with its original part name to the Registry, following the submission guidelines.
Part Number(s):
- BBa_K1408000 [Received, Accepted]
- BBa_K1408001 [Received, Accepted]
- BBa_K1408002 [Received, Accepted]
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
Part Number(s):
- BBa_K1408000 [Received, Accepted]
- BBa_K1408001 [Received, Accepted]
- BBa_K1408002 [Received, Accepted]
Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines)
Part Number(s):
- BBa_K1408000 [Received, Accepted]
- BBa_K1408001 [Received, Accepted]
- BBa_K1408002 [Received, Accepted]
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.

Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal: (one OR more)
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part.

Best Part Collection
Link to page on your team's wiki: Team:Washington/BioBricksPage size: 3133
Short description of collection function and Range of Part Numbers
Our collection of three parts consists of a degron, the test plasmid containing the GAL4-VP16 transactivator, and a construct used in evolving our protein for higher GFP.With those two parts alone, BBa_K1408001 and BBa_K1408002, users can use BioBrick cloning or PCR to generate ALL 5 test constructs: Deg0, Deg1, Deg2, Deg3, and Deg4. We chose to submit these parts separately to allow future users the utmost freedom in designing a specific test construct for their specific protein of interest.  List all of the Parts in this collection (Yes, all 100 of them to impress the judges)
Part Number(s):
- BBa_K1408000 [Received, Accepted]
- BBa_K1408001 [Received, Accepted]
- BBa_K1408002 [Received, Accepted]
