Preparation of E.coli competent cell
Supercompetent E.coli for long term storage
1. Inoculate 4 ml LB medium with the appropriate E. coli strain and incubate the culture overnight at 37°C.
2. Inoculate 500 ml SOB medium with the overnight culture and incubate at 25-30°C until an OD600 of approximately 0.5.
3. Chill the culture for at least 10 min on ice.
During the following steps, the cell suspension should be kept on ice as much as possible.
4. Centrifuge the cell suspension for 10 min at 4,500 to 6,000 rpm at 4°C.
5. Gently resuspend the pellet in 100 ml ice-cold TB buffer.
6. Incubate the cell suspension on ice for 10 min.
7. Centrifuge for 10 min 4000 rpm at 4°C.
8. Gently resuspend the pellet in 18.6 ml ice-cold TB buffer and add 1.4 ml DMSO.
9. Incubate the cell suspension on wet ice for at least 10 min.
10.  Aliquot 100 µl of the cell suspension in 1.5 ml tubes.
11. Shock-freeze the cell suspension in liquid nitrogen and store the tubes at -80°C or in liquid nitrogen.
At -80°C the cells will be competent for at least 6 months. In liquid nitrogen they will stay competent indefinitely.

Competent cells with CMMB80 buffer and TOP10 strain
1. Inoculate 250 ml of SOB medium with 1 ml over day culture and incubate at 18°C for approx. 19 hours until it reaches an OD600 of 0.3.
2. Fill an ice bucket halfway with ice. Use the ice to pre-chill as many flat bottom centrifuge bottles as needed.
3. Transfer the culture to the flat bottom centrifuge tubes. Weigh and balance the tubes using a scale.
4. Centrifuge at 3000 g and 4°C for 10 minutes in a flat bottom centrifuge bottle.
5. Decant supernatant into waste and gently resuspend the pellet in 80 ml of ice cold CCMB80 buffer.
     a. Pro tip: add first 40ml  to resuspend the cells. When cells are in suspension, add another 40ml CCMB80 buffer for a total volume of 80ml.
     b. Pipette buffer against the wall of the centrifuge bottle to resuspend cells. Do not pipette  directly onto the cell pellet!
     c. After pipetting, there will still be some residual cells stuck to the bottom. Swirl the bottles  gently to resuspend these remaining cells.
6. Incubate on ice for 20 minutes and centrifuge again at 3000 rpm at 4°C. Decant supernatant.
7. Resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml of ice cold CCMB80 buffer.
8. Measure OD600 and add chilled CCMB80 to yield a final OD of 1.0 - 1.5.
9. Incubate on ice for 20 minutes. Prepare 1.5 ml E-cups, aliquote 100 µl of the cell suspension and freeze them immediately in liquid nitrogen. Store at -80°C.
Fast competent E.coli cells for ready-to-use
1. Inoculate 4 ml LB in a test-tube with a single colony. Grow over night at 37°C.
2. Use 250 µl to inoculate 25 ml of LB in a 250ml bottle the next morning.
3. Shake until an OD600 0.3 - 0.4 is reached.
4. Collect the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 rpm and 4°C.
5. Discard supernatant and gently resuspend in 10 ml of cold 0.5 M CaCl.
(cells are susceptible to mechanical disruption, so treat them nicely).
7. Incubate on ice for 20 minutes.
8. Centrifuge as described in 4.
9. Discard supernatant and gently resuspend in 0.5(up to 1.5) ml cold 0.5 M CaCl2.
10. Use 50 - 100 µl of the suspension for transformation.

3. Resolve the pellet in 200 µl BD I solution + 10 µl RNAse (10mg/ml) and mix by vortexing. Incubate 5 minutes at room temperature.
4. Add 100 µl of BD IIA and BDIIB,mix by vortexing and incubate 5 minutes on ice.
5. Add 200 µl of BDIII,invert 4 times and incubate 10 min on ice.
6. Centrifuge samples at 13000 rpm for 10 min and transfer supernatant to a new 1.5 ml E-cup.
7. Add 750 µl ice-cold 2-propanol (isopropanol) and incubate 30 minutes at -20°C (can be extended).
8. Centrifuge 10 minutes at 13000 rpm and4°C. Discard supernatant. A small DNA pellet should be visible.
9. To wash, add 500 µl ice cold EtOH 70 % and invert you sample - centrifuge for 10 min at 13000 rpm.
10. Discard supernatant and dry your plasmid under sterile hood at 50°C.
11. Resolve pellet in water and measure DNA concentration  and/or check by gel-electrophoresis.
E.coli transformation
- Put 1μl of circular plasmid or all of a ligation reaction of plasmid DNA in a 1.5 ml tube. Gently add ~100 μl of competent cells.
- Incubate for 30 min on ice.
- Heat shock for 2 min @ 42°C. Put back on ice.
- Add 900 μl of LB to tubes. Incubate @ 37°C for 30 min.
- Plate different concentrations (e.g. 50, 100, rest μL) of the cells on LB + antibiotics plates. Incubate them @ 37°C overnight.
