Results summary
We obtained working structural models for our peptides inside their scaffolds. The following table is a summary of them. Please note that these models are not definitive, since they were obtained by homology modeling and loop refinement. Their main purpose is to give us an idea if the calculated energy profile matches our assumption that the peptide is being exposed to the exterior of the scaffold.
