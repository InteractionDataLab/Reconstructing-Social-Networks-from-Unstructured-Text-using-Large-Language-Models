Overview
Background
Fungal pathogens are a major public health threat with significant global effects which, surprisingly, are not being addressed as they should.
Our project
We want to produce peptides that bind to fungi. See why this matters.
Dry lab
Our peptides are small and fit into a scaffold with a known structure. We simulated their three-dimensional structure by homology modelling.
Wet lab
We have been busy at the lab picking peptides and much more. See how we did it.
Perspectives
The peptides we generated can be further refined and potentially become diagnostic and therapeutic tools.
BioBricks
We want to share what we did so others can develop it further. Take a look at our BioBricks.
