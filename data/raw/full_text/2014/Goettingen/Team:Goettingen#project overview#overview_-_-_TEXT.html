Project Overview
Background
Fungal pathogens are a major public health threat with significant global effects which, surprisingly, is not being addressed as it should.
Our project!
We want to produce peptides that bind to fungi. See why this matters.
Perspectives
The peptides we generated can be further refined and potentially become diagnosis and therapeutic tools.
Dry lab
Our peptides are small and fit into a scaffold with a known structure. We simulated their three-dimensional structure by homology modelling.
Wet lab
We've been busy at the lab picking peptides and much more. See how we did it.
Gallery
As the old adage goes: pics or it didn't happen.
BioBricks
We want to share what we did so others can develop it further. There are also some tools for working with yeasts. Take a look at our BioBricks.
