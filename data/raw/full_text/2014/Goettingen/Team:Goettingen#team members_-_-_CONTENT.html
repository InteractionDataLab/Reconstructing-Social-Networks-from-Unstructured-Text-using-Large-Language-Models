        Hey my name is Cedric. 
	yeah like the guy in Harry Potter. Funnily, in the laboratory I feel sometimes like a magician. I finished my B.Sc. in Göttingen at the Department of General Microbiology (AG Stülke), during my bachelor thesis, I analyzed the relation of biofilm formation of <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> and c-di-GMP. Now I am in the second semester of M.Sc. Microbiology and Biochemistry in Göttingen. I am interested in eukaryotic/prokaryotic regulatory processes as well as in medical biology.

        Hello, I'm Miguel, a Genomic Biotechnologist from Monterrey, Mexico. My main interests are Systems Biology and Synthetic Biology. I enjoy playing music, reading, interesting talks and long walks. I'm also part of the Mexican Synthetic Biology Network (<A href="www.synbiomx.org">www.synbiomx.org</A>) and I regularly contribute to its blog.

	Hello everybody,
	my name is Lara and like most of our team members, I am studying in the 2nd semester of the Master’s program “Microbiology and Biochemistry” in Göttingen. I already did my bachelor studies in Göttingen where I became especially interested in genetics and eukaryotic microorganisms. This is one of the reasons why I am really excited about our iGEM project. Besides, I am participating in the iGEM competition because I think it is a great opportunity to develop and realize your own research project and to gain new experiences.
Apart from the university, I like to go out with friends, doing sports and have fun! So I hope that we will have a lot of fun during our project!

	Hi
	My name is Anika. I am currently studying Microbiology and Biochemistry in the Master program in Göttingen. That is where I also wrote my Bachelor thesis about the necessity of the citric acid cycle in <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> (by the way, it is not necessary ;) ). I am fascinated about the little organisms like bacteria and also pathogenic fungi. During my bachelor thesis I became more and more interested in the field of synthetic biology and that is why I joined this year’s iGEM Team.

	Hi there, my name is quite strange but also unique.  I come from Mexico and I kicked a ball sooner than learning to walk well, so I enjoy playing soccer. The other thing within my veins is chemistry.  Being son of chemical engineers, I decided to keep the legacy of engineering but directed to Biotechnology. Therefore, I worked with biocatalysts for the production of biofuels in my bachelor thesis and currently I am studying the second semester of my master.
Now I am on board of the iGEM Göttingen team, let’s rock!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="teamM"><DIV class="titleRight"><H3><CENTER>Organization Team</CENTER></H3><H3><CENTER>Wet lab</CENTER></H3><H3><CENTER>Presentation</CENTER></H3></DIV><DIV class="content"><H2>Julia Menzel</H2><P>3 things my friends say about me: <B>ambitious, chaotic, and mostly in a good mood.</B>
	Hey guys! My name is Julia Menzel and I am currently studying in the second semester of the Master’s program “Microbiology and Biochemistry”. I already did my bachelor thesis in Gottingen, in the Department of molecular microbiology and genetics and characterized a transcription factor in the mould <I>Aspergillus fumigatus</I>.  I participate in iGEM because I want to be part in project quite from the beginning, earn more lab work experience and of course it sounds like fun. If I am not in the lab, you can found me on the back of my horse, going jogging or having fun with friends.

	Hello everyone I ’am Karthikeyan from Tamil Nadu, India…
	Nature and life forms fascinates me and lead me in the field of life sciences. So, I did my graduation in Biotechnology. My work on isolating and characterizing endophytes from Banana pith and pseudo stem for my bachelor’s thesis was in finding naturally accessible means to utilize the enormous quantity of biomass wasted after the fruit harvest. 
Synthetic Biology- It’s a platform to apply our knowledge to create something spectacular for better understanding of life and for the betterment of mankind. To me, iGEM as an international platform to experiment with synthetic biology, was not a choice but a chance, to experience an unforgettable journey in Science. Join me along to Boston, for a fun filled learning experience.

	Hi! My name is Shantal and I come from Mexico, one of the biggest cities in the world! that’s why I like the versatility, the movement, the noise! But during my free time I love to go to places where I can enjoy nature, calm and quality time with my family and friends... you can say that I like the best of both worlds! and so, I chose my Bachelor looking for exactly the same thing, I have always been good in math but I loved immunology, parasitology and everything related to infectious biology! Therefore I decided to study Biotechnological Engineering and for my thesis I worked with the Biosecurity Manual for a lab that diagnoses epidemiological diseases back home, after all, security comes first. I am currently doing my Master in Microbiology and Biochemistry, part of iGEM Team Göttingen and hoping that all of you decide to follow us on our way to Boston 2014!

My name is KamalPrakash Nair and I am a student enrolled in the program Microbiology and Biochemistry at the University of Goettingen. Being a member of the iGEM (2014) Goettingen team, I feel much honored to be able to contribute to the scientific community through the application of Synthetic Biology. Moreover, it’s a splendid opportunity to be a part of a competition that involves students and teachers from all around the globe. As far as my past goes, I have been into gleaning information since my high school days and enjoyed figuring out the reason behind both natural phenomenon as well as intriguing inventions.  As for my educational background, my bachelor’s degree was in the field of Biotechnology after which I went on to do a master’s degree in Clinical Microbiology at Glasgow, UK. My primary areas of interest include Immunology, Microbial and Human Genetics.
I firmly believe that the search for answers to the functioning of Nature is the best way to expand one’s mind and my vision for the future is to gain mastery over my fields of interest while applying the knowledge I hitherto gained for the benefit of mankind!  </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="teamM"><DIV class="titleRight"><H3><CENTER>Human Pratices</CENTER></H3><H3><CENTER>Stage Director</CENTER></H3></DIV><DIV class="content"><H2>Bahar Khonsari</H2><P>3 things my friends say about me: <B>energetic, humorous and creative.</B>
	Hey everybody, I’m Bahar and I’m studying Microbiology and Biochemistry in the master program in Göttingen University. I’m from Iran and I did my bachelor studies about cellular and molecular biology. I’m a fan of plant microbiology and whenever I have to work with these green living multicellular organisms I can spend 24 hour in the lab. Each time I’m not in the lab you can find me in front of a canvas with a painting brush in my hand or watching movies or hanging around with some friends. I’m also interested in learning different languages and travelling around the world. I participated in this iGEM team to learn more about biosynthetic methods and also work and travel with some creative, nice people.

        Hi I am Rayan Korri, a master student in &quot;Microbiology and Biochemistry&quot; Program. It is really a pleasure to be part of an international contest, where students from all over the world meet to share their ideas about synthetic biology. After receiving my Bachelor in Medical Laboratory Science from the American University of Beirut and working for one year in hospital laboratories, I realised the importance of scientific research in improving Human wellness. I hope we will be able to participate in this improvement through our work for IGEM.

        Hey, I am Wanwan and 100% made in China. As a first-year  Master student in &quot;Microbiology and Biochemistry&quot; in University Göttingen, I like exploring the macroscopic world as well as the microscopic world. After working on genetic modification in <I>Fusarium</I> during my bachelor, I realised that it’s a powerful tool to use synthetic methods to design and construct new genetic materials for industrial applications. I am here in the iGEM team to learn more about biosynthetic field and also have fun together with creative people.
