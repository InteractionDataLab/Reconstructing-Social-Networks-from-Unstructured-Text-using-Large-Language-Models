Achievements
Project
We intend to develop a fast screening technique for invasive fungi, such as Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. The idea is to tag invasive fungal cells with a special peptide marker. By further modifying this protein marker with a signal molecule, the resulting construct has applications in both diagnostics and therapeutics.
Notebook
Follow our steps and see how our wet-lab and dry-lab teams operated each day over the last 7 months; this part includes the experimental objectives of the aforementioned teams and their current status, methods used and last but not the least, the results.
Team
Our team consists of 12 ambitious and dedicated master students of Microbiology and Biochemistry from the Georg-August University of Göttingen. We love the quest for answers and are supporting each other to the fullest in order to accomplish our objectives! Go through the link for more information on the team.
Outreach
Here, you can find the literature relevant to our project such as, the booklet for fundraising, the slides of our presentations, our progress reports, posters and flyers which we made as part of the human practice segment. Spread the word on synthetic biology and let us expand this ever-growing community!
