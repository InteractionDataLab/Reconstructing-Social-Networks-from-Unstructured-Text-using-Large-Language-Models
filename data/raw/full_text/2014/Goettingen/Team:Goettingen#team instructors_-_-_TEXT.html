Prof. Dr. Gerhard Braus
Professor of Microbiology and Genetics
Dr. Gerhard Braus (1957) studied biology at the University of Freiburg. He earned a PhD degree (1987) and the habilitation (1992) at the ETH Zürich. He was appointed as Assoc. Professor of Biochemistry at University of Erlangen in 1993 and full Professor of Microbiology& Genetics in Göttingen in 1996. Additional periods included the Biocenter in Basel, the University of Georgia in Athens GA, and the BMS Institute of Functional Genomics, Princeton NJ. Braus' laboratory focuses on genetics, biochemistry and cell biology of eukaryotic microorganisms. The interplay between development (adhesion, filament formation, tissue formation) and secondary metabolism (acting as benign or toxic bioactive molecules) is analysed. A second line of research examines the impact of fungal pathogens on human health and agriculture.
Dr. rer. nat. Christoph Sasse
Postdoc
Dr. Christoph Sasse studied biology at the University of Göttingen. After he finished his diploma thesis (2004) in the department of Molecular Microbiology and Genetics of Prof. Braus, he worked as a scientific assistant in this department till 2008. Then he continued  with postdoc at the University of Würzburg at the IMIB, working on the topic of drug resistance and white opaque switching in C. albicans. Since 2012 he is a postdoc at the Institute of Microbiology and Genetics in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Genetics of Prof. Braus, working on the topic of drug resistance and stress response in A. fumigatus.
PD Dr. Joachim Uhrig
Dr. Joachim Uhrig studied Biology at the Ruhr-University Bochum, where he earned a Diploma and PhD. After three years in industry (Bayer Crop Science), he established his own research group as an independent group leader at the Max-Planck-Institute for Plant Breeding Research and at the University of Cologne. The Uhrig laboratory worked on plant-pathogen interactions and plant signaling and development with a focus on genome-wide protein interaction mapping and biological network analysis. In 2004 he earned the Habilitation (venia legendi in Biochemistry) at the University of Cologne. In 2012 he joined the Department of Plant Molecular Biology and Physiology (Prof. C. Gatz) at the University of Göttingen.
