Informieren und spenden: „Internationales Forscherteam kämpft gegen Pilzinfektionen - iGEM 2014“ auf betterplace.org öffnen.
Projects
We intend to develop a fast screening technique for different invasive fungi, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Aspergillus nidulans. The idea is to tag the invasive fungal cells with a special protein marker. By modifying the protein marker with a proper signal molecule, we will be able to accomplish a fast and direct elimination of invasive fungi.
Notebook
Follow our steps and see how our wetlab and drylab subteams operated day by day in the lab in order to achieve our goal of developing a fast screening technique for invasive fungi.
Team
Our team consists of 12 ambitious and dedicated master students of Microbiology and Biochemistry from the Georg-August University of Göttingen. We love science and nature, we are supporting each other and we are ready for challenges .
Outreach
If you want to see more details about our project, here you can find the related documents, involving our booklet for fundraising, the slides of all our presentations, our progress reports, posters and flyers those we did as our human practice. We hope these will be helpful for other teams.
