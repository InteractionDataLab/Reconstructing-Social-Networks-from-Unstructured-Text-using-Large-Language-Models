Applications in Diagnostics
Lowering costs and the burden
The attachment of a chemical moiety that emits a quantifiable signal (a   fluorescent, enzymatic or luminiscent moiety) to our peptides can lead to an   alternative diagnostic method to antibody and antibody fragments with the added   benefit of the relative low cost of production and modification of small peptides. This cost reduction may   help to spread this diagnostic tool to the markets of the developing world, where   fungal infections have the largest mortality rates and were health care is   largely affected by economic constraints. Moreover, if the peptides prove to have a high species-specificity, the diagnosis based on them may give more information for a proper therapy choice, potentially reducing the toxicity risks associated with the use of broad spectrum antimycotics.
In vivo diagnosis and the potential of artificial selection
Short peptides are currently being used as diagnostic tools for certain kind   of cancers. These peptides are naturally produced by humans   and have their natural binding proteins in the surface of cells; however, they   have been optimized to increase their half-life and their affinity towards their   natural target, and they also have been modified with radionuclides that make it   possible to detect the location of tumors -cells were their binding proteins are   overrepresented- with PET or SECT imaging.
The most common isotopically labelled peptide used for diagnosisis a 111In-labelled somatostatin analogue, known as OctreoScanTM, which is used to diagnose a variety of tumors. Other peptides under   develompent are cholecystokinin/gastrin analogues, glucagon-like peptide-1,   bombesin, chemokine receptor CXCR4 targeting peptides, RGD peptides, exendin,   Substance P, LHRH, neurotensin, α-M2, α-M2H and VIP.
Following the same rationale, our artificially selected peptides can be modified and optimized to increase their binding affinity and their half-life. The peptides can then be tagged with radionuclides to enable the diagnosis by imaging techniques. The results of such a diagnostic method will give more information about the localization and spread of the fungal infection inside the patient's body than any of the currently available diagnostic methods.
