PCR with different plasmid isolation samples for prey amplification (IG1003 and IG0099; 52,5 °C)
Agarose gel (1%):
      ⇒ Bands in all samples
      ⇒ Purification and restriction with HpaI and BamHI
- Restriction of of 0,1 µl (14500ng/µl) pGP172 with SmaI and BamHI o/n 16°C
- ligation of cut cleaned PCR prey products with pGP172 (10ng/µl)  4µl of each with 1µl T4 Ligase in 20 µl sample
- Transformation into DH5α
- Again: plasmid isolation and PCR with T7 promotor and terminator primer on plasmids
Agarose gel (1%):
      ⇒ In lines 4 to 9 seems to be the right fragment; 2 and 3 are wrong
- Transformation into BL21
- Test-expression of strep-tag strains: 4.1A, 4.1B, 5A, 5B, 14.5A, 14.5B, 14.8A, 14.8B
- Preparation of SDS gels
- PCR with Primers IG1003 and IG0099 → product that can be sequenced and cut with enzymes for strep tag plasmid insertion (samples of prey from 3, 13 and 15)
Agarose gel (1%):
      ⇒ Bands in lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 9 and 11 have the right size and are first purified and then send for sequencing with Primer IG1003 (rev)
- Prey samples of 3A.1, 3A.2, 3A.3, 3B.1, 3B.2, 13.3, 15 digested with BamHI and HpaI
      ⇒ Clear difference between cut and uncut; also cut bands are very weak
- Results of sequencing (3, 13, 15):
      ⇒ 3A.1, 3A.2, 3A.3 are the same peptide
      ⇒ 3B.1 and 3B.2: sequences are not useful
      ⇒ 13.3 and 13.4: same peptide
      ⇒ 9: one interacting peptide
      ⇒ 10 + 15: same interacting peptide→?
