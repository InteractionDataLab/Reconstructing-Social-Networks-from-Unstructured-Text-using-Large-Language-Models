However, our project is ultimately one that must be generally acceptable to its users (and the public as a whole) for it to serve its purpose.
       We were contemplating several possible delivery strategies, each of which had its own technical pros and cons. However, what we sorely lacked was the point of view of the general public - how would an Alzheimer’s patient feel about receiving our therapeutics? In what manner would he/she prefer to be treated?
       To address this, we designed a public opinion survey, which aimed to determine what method of delivery would cause the least public outcry and be able to be administered as a therapeutic to the largest majority of people.
The survey data was useful and provided results akin to those we expected. In general, people are more comfortable with less invasive methods of delivery. This lead to design decisions for our project that are compatible with viral delivery to neurons, that would be (theoretically) administered via blood injection.
       This survey could be easily modified and used for any project considering the public opinion of their research/science. It includes several set-up and gating questions, and is short, simple and quick.

As a potential therapy for Alzheimer’s disease, our system would have to somehow be inserted into the human body. We considered several aspects of this process, and though we would never be performing it ourselves, we sought to design our system such that the safest, most effective, and most publicly acceptable method of delivery would be used. 
      We began by interviewing professionals in the field of neuroscience and Alzheimer’s disease (see <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:MIT/2014.igem.org/Team:MIT/Interviews" style="color:teal"> Interviews</A>). Armed with the industry opinion and our own research, we designed various methods of delivery and considered the pros and cons of each.
      We also considered the necessity of public approval of the system for it to be effective as a therapeutic. This led to the formulation of our <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Wiki/2014.igem.org/Team:MIT/Survey" style="color:teal"> public opinion survey</A>.
      Ultimately, these considerations aided us in designing the system that we have developed. We targeted the path of neuron delivery, but also explored numerous other delivery options.</DD></DL></LI></OL></P><H1 style="font-size:15px"> Bronze Medal </H1><OL><LI><DL><DT><B>Register the team</B></DT><DD>We are a registered iGEM team</DD></DL></LI><LI><DL><DT><B>Complete Judging form</B></DT><DD>We have completed all required information on the Judging Form</DD></DL></LI><LI><DL><DT><B>Create and share a description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts</B></DT><DD> We have created a team wiki and submitted our parts to the Registry</DD></DL></LI><LI><DL><DT><B>Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree</B></DT><DD> We have prepared a poster and a talk, both of which we will present at the Jamboree</DD></DL></LI><LI><DL><DT><B>The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services</B></DT><DD>We have compiled a complete list of <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:MIT/Actually_Attributions" style="color:teal"> attributions </A></DD></DL></LI><LI><DL><DT><B>Document at least one new standard BioBrick part or device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry </B></DT><DD> We have created, documented and submitted a variety of new parts (see our <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:MIT/Parts" style="color:teal"> Parts </A> page)
