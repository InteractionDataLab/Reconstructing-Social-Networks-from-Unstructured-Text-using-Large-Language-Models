Mentors
Of course, science is impossible without collaboration. Our project would not have been possible if it had not been for the innumerable times we were helped by our undergraduate mentors, our supervisor, Brian Teague, our PI, Ron Weiss and other researchers in the lab. From teaching us how to pipet, debugging our PCR problems to lending us parts to use in our project, providing expert insight on doing western blots or running cytometry on our cells, they were with us all the way. We were also helped throughout the summer by the MIT Bioengineering Department’s Writing and Communication Lab, which instructed us from skills ranging from reading scientific papers to making an effective poster to presenting a good talk. Without all the help and guidance we received, we would be lost.
New England iGEM (NEGEM)
Being in Boston with another hundred colleges and universities around us means it only makes sense for the iGEM teams to meet up. A Boston University tradition started in 2012, the 2014 NEGEM consisted of the BU, MIT, Harvard, Rutgers, Tufts, and Worcester Polytechnical Institute iGEM teams. We met three times throughout the course of our summer, presenting and critiquing our projects and presentations, and discussing possible improvements to research methods, presentation style and effectiveness. We also discussed the possibility collaborations between the teams.
We would like to give our warmest thanks to Traci Haddock and the BU team for organizing this wonderful and useful event.
