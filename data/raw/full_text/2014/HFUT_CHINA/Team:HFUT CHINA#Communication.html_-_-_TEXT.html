Communication with other teams
 
We team HFUT_CHINA keeps good connects with USTC_Software. As it's our first year to participate the iGEM and USTC has got great achievements in the last few years, there're a lot for us to learn and USTC is a good one. In the usual days, we communicated with each other and talked about the problems and tried to solve them. We also had some meetings in order to show our working process. What we saw gave us energy and we did  benefit a lot from them.
 
Also, we had communication with other Chinese teams such as SYSU, BIT and UESTC.
 
In the software testing session, we asked for some existing parts from those teams or their wet teams to check our software.
