Time Complexity Analysis
The algorithms used in  Biodesigner could be grouped into two categories: preprocessing part and executing  part.
Preprocessing Part
The preprocessing part includes three algorithms. Here we assume there are n devices and each device  contains at most m biobrickes.
The first one is to count  the probabilities of two successive biobrickes, three successive biobrickes,  four successive biobrickes and five successive biobrickes. Here successive  biobrickes means the biobrickes are neighbors. Thus the number of two successive  biobrickes, three successive biobrickes, four successive biobrickes and five successive  biobrickes are n(m-1),  n(m-2), n(m-3),  n(m-4), respectively. Hash tables are used to store these successive  biobrickes. Therefore, the probabilities could be obtained by scanning the  device chains four times. Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(2n(m-1)+3n(m-2)+4n(m-3)+5n(m-3))=O(nm).   
The second one is to count  the probabilities of the first biobrick of each device chain. This work could  be done by scanning the first biobrick of each chain. Thus, the complexity of  this algorithm is O(n).
The third one is to  calculate the hamming distances of each paired biobrickes.  Since there are n device chains and each  device contains at most m biobrickes. Therefore, there are at most nm  biobrickes, which means there are at most nm*nm paired biobrickes. The  calculation of hamming distances between two sequences with length l could be  done in O(l) time. Thus, the complexity of this algorithm is O(l*nm*nm).
Hence, the time complexity  of preprocessing part is O(nm)+O(n)+O(l*nm*nm) =O(l*nm*nm).
Executing Part
The executing part contains  two algorithms. Here we assume the given device chain contains at most m  biobrickes.
The first one is to  inquire the probabilities of two successive biobrickes, three successive  biobrickes, four successive biobrickes and five successive biobrickes of a  given device chain. Since all the data is stored in a hash table and the access  of hash table needs O(1) time. Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm is  O(m).
The second one is to store  the given device chain. This work is done by store the two successive  biobrickes, three successive biobrickes, four successive biobrickes and five successive  biobrickes of the given device chain into the hash table. Thus, the time  complexity of this algorithm is O(m).
Hence, the time complexity  of executing part is O(m).
Note, we only need to  execute the preprocessing part once. After the execution of preprocessing part,  all the data is store in database. When using our software, users do not need  to waste their time for the preprocessing part as it has been executed.
Experimental Results
In order to test the  performance of our software, we collected about 3600 device chains from  Registry of Standard Parts, and extracted the associate relationships among  these chains. All these information are stored in our database.
Firstly, we tested the  response time of different functions of our software. Table 1 shows the results  of different query functions. The results are averaged from 10 independent  runs. From the results, we can find that all the time is really short, less  than 0.1 seconds.

We also tested the  response time of recommendation. Table 2 listed the results in terms of  different number of given biobricks. Since our software recommend biobrick  based on at most 4 biobricks’ information. Thus, the maximum number of given  biobricks is 4. These times are really short, less than 0.4 seconds. Users  could get the recommendation almost instantly. This could greatly reduce the  time used for designing.

Secondly, we tested the  performance of recommendation. 10 device chains were randomly selected for this  test. Table 3 shows the results, where the recommendation ratio is the ratio of  the number of correctly recommended biobricks over the length of device chains,  and the correctly recommended biobricks means these biobricks are in recommended  lists. The average recommendation ratio is 75.4%. This ratio actually is really  high, since only 24.6% of biobricks are not in the recommended lists.

We also use the new  designed chains from BIT team to test the performance of our software. Table 4  shows the results. The averaged recommendation ratio is 66.9%. This ratio is  smaller than the ratio tested above. The reason is that the new designed chains  consist of some new biobricks that the database does not contain. These  biobricks are hardly to recommend and effect the recommendation of next  biobrick. However, this ratio still proves our software works well even when  using new designed biobricks. We could believe that as more and more biobricks  and device chains are added into our database, our software could recommend  more and more efficiently and accurately.
