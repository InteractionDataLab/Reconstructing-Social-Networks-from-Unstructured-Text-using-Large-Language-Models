Algorithm
In order to recommend the relevant biobricks, some advanced algorithms and classical methods are employed in the software. These algorithms and methods include Collaborative Filtering and Association Rules.
 
1.Collaborative Filtering
 
Collaborative  Filtering recommendation has become a very popular system in message filter and  information system. Different from traditional filters that analyze the content  directly, Collaborative Filtering analyzes the habits of users and find the similar  users for a given user. By dealing with the information of similar users, Collaborative  Filtering will predict the users’ interest and recommend the relevant  information.
 
Compared  with traditional text filtering, the advantages of Collaborative Filtering are  as follows: First it can filter the information that the machine is hard to  analysis based on the text. Second it based on the concept which hard to  express.
 
Collaborative  Filtering can be divided into two kinds, item-based CF and user-based CF, which  will be introduced as follows.
1.1 item-based CF
The  main idea of Item-based CF is that for a given biobrick, the algorithm finds  similar biobricks to recommend according to the similarity between two  biobricks.
In  our software, we use Hamming distance to measure the similarity of two  biobricks. Hamming distance is named by Richard Wesley Hamming, which was first  used in basic thesis about error detection and correction code. Today, hamming distance  analysis is widely used in many areas including information theory coding  theory, cryptography, etc.
The  Hamming distance of two equal-length character strings is the number of  different character in their correspondence position. In other words, it is the  number of change that changing one alphabetic string to another. For example,  the Hamming distance of 1011101and 1001001 is two.
In  our software, we calculate the hamming distance of each paired biobrick  sequence and use it as the similarity of these sequences.
1.2 User-based CF
The  main idea of User-based CF is to find similar users by analyzing the previous  behavior of different users and recommend biobricks based on the  behavior of similar user.
Pearson  correlation coefﬁcient is used to measure the similarity of different users.  The definition of Pearson correlation coefﬁcient is as follows:
 
2. Association rule
Association  rule is a widely used and well researched method for discovering relations  between variables. When using association rule for recommendation, there are  mainly two separate steps:
First,  minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a  database.
Second,  these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form  rules.
For  the first step, we first collect all the device chains from Registry of  Standard Biological Parts and then calculate the frequency of two successive biobrickes,  three successive biobrickes, four successive biobrickes and five successive  biobrickes. Here successive biobrickes means the biobrickes are neighbors and  the frequency of a set of successive biobricks is named support. After the  calculation of the frequency, we find all successive biobrickes that  have support greater than the minimum support.
For the second step, the large sets of  successive biobricks are used to generate the desired rules that  have confidence greater than the minimum confidence. Here confidence a  measure of the reliability of an estimate. It consists of a range of values  (interval) that act as good estimates of the unknown population parameter.
