Start
The project was begun on July 1st to the end of October before attending the competition, a total of four months. Major progresses so far in each time period are as follows:
7/07/14
Catch the information
Sorted out with the 2012 software teams’ comprehensive information such as University of Tokyo, grasped the theme of each teams’ project with winning situations and cleared each team innovation and the remaining problems.
7/10/14
Sprout garlic kohlrabi
We analyzed with the 2013 software teams’ information, most entries are similar to the 2012’s, while some are expanded on the basis of 2012’s. We sorted out other years like 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 software teams’ information.
7/14/14
Identify the project theme
We initially identified the project theme: Build a parts-database of existing Synthetic Biology System, by complying the analysis the parts across the database, to support fixing the existing Synthetic Biology System with searching parts or building a new Synthetic Biology System by recommending related parts.
7/15/14
We communicate with the competition committee; clear the winning requirements to iGEM 2014 software teams so as to meet them in the process of designing.
7/20/14
We arrange for some core teammates to browse iGEM official website, access to previous years’ each team wiki, be familiar with the way to obtain information, deepen the comprehend of various aspects. Others learn some of the database. When core teammates are familiar with the access to information, teach they’ll teach others by network meeting.
7/31/14
We talked things about the extraction format of database information and the division of everyone’s work, and Entity-Relationship Diagram. We also tried to sort out dependencies between properties, improve the level of database paradigm. The team information was finished in accordance with the basic format of the information.
8/10/14
Further clarify the project functions, and discuss further progress: building existing model parts’ dependencies database. Assign teammates sort out the dependencies of the existing Synthetic Biology System.
8/17/14
At the invitation of USTC, three of our teammates attend the iGEM software meetup held at USTC, and had some deep talks to other top universities. The project ideas got the expert judges praises.
8/20/14
According to the team information sorted out in July, our software can achieve the functions to output the corresponding parts by the specified year, all years or the groups, and some of the team information by parts. Some teammates continue to sort out the dependencies of the existing Synthetic Biology System.
8/31/14
We’ve built the dependencies database of existing parts. And with this database, we talked the way to design new algorithms and assigned teammates to research related algorithms.
9/15/14
We achieved information retrieval of parts by use of the rational data structure, the efficient search algorithm, and master JavaScript, added some special effects on wiki page in order to enhanced web ornamental. We also established a WeChat group in order to improve the communciation and working.
9/20/14
Today we had the first team meeting of this term. We talked about our own achievements till now and discuss the next mission. Li Wenhan and Ding Xingyu will continue sorting out the database and picking up the related parts and listing the definitional parts’ sequence. Bai Dingyu and I are responsible for the documents include overall, team introductions, the detail of the software and the methodologies. Xia Yu, Ding Huitong and Gong Bowen will finish the rest work of the software and test it several times.
9/25/14
Most of the overall has been completed. And Xia Yu has loaded he database and check the software running experimentally and he said “it works well.” The GUI is done by Gong Bowen and it just needs some artistic rendering. Ding Huitong has been fixing up the wiki page. The main distribution is done and he’s trying to beautify the page. Rest of database is on the finishing.
9/29/14
Today we discussed some things about the Third-party software testing in order to have a deep check, and the wiki-page style, shirts with team logo for the competition. At last we decided to design a logo based on our school logo with some bio-symbols like genes. We also found some time to book the flight tickets and look for the hotel in Boston on the web. And our instructor appointed me to write logs and take pictures in the meeting. The National Day is coming, and it's time to push ourselves more for the work and aim!
9/30/14
Now I have translated the previous blogs (last term and summer vacation) from Chinese into English. And our girls have nearly completed the data collection. Other good news is that the software's foreground and background have been begun to be integrated.
10/1/14
Today Xia Yu made a oral speech to our instructor in order to simulate the speech on the competition. And our instructor thought it good. Ding Huitong added some animation effects. When the software finished, the rest of wiki page will be done.
10/3/14
Today we discuss the animation effects of wiki page. We decided to four pictures on the main page to show and explain our works. I’ll handle with that. Bai Dingyu will take some photos to record our working lives and finally put them in the “Team” parts. Xia Yu and Gong Bowen will build the server, solve communication problems of the front and rear ends and try to accept the information.
10/6/14
These days, Xia Yu and Gong Bowen are busy at the interaction between foreground and background by adjusting code. Ding Huitong have added some articles and pictures to wiki page and once we finish something, we’ll send to him immediately and he’ll upload to the wiki. After three-day working, I’ve finished the pictures which will put on the main page. The other work are being carried out in accordance with the plan.
10/7/14
In the morning, we used the Skype to run the demonstration of the software. We did in our own computer instead of connecting to the server. And we reported the process of the work to our instructors. One of the instructors An thought we should expedite our work. Other thing is he thought the staffing isn’t reasonable and he changed some of it: Ding Huitong will help Xia Yu to establish the database and upload it to the server; Ding Xingyu will test the software by the each of the unit and the whole software; Li Wenhan will assist our the other instructors Yang to check the staffing in order to speed up the whole work and make it more reasonable; Bai Dingyu and I are responsible for the wiki page including text upload and the animation effects. To make showing effect better on the competition, the instructor An lends us a more powerful computer.
10/8/14
In the evening,we had anoother meeting. The instructor An reiterate the emergency of rest work and the meaning of attending the match.We're inspired!
