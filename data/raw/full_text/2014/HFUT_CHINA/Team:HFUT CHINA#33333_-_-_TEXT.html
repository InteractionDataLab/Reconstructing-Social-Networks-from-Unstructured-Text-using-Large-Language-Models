Team project descriptions
As the iGEM’s influence increases, a growing number of teams participated in the game, resulting in more and more synthetic biological systems. However, there are few softwares analyzing these systems. Actually, some interesting problems may be solved by analyzing these systems. For example, if we only know parts or complete information of a system’s model, can we determine the function of this system? Another problem is that can existing systems provide useful information for helping designing new systems. Therefore, our aim of developing a software is to solve the above two problems by doing some analysis on existing systems. The first problem will be solved by searching similar systems and the second problem will be addressed by analyzing the models of existing systems.
