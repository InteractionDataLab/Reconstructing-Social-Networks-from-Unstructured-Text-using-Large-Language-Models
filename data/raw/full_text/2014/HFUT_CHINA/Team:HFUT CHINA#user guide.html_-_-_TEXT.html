The software would do the error correction if the user click the check button. Design panel, the immense panel in the middle, is the place where the user do their works. On the left of the design panel is the search area， where users can search the BioBrick by keywords(name or type). When a BioBrick label is clicked, the information will be presented on the right side of the design panel. If you click a BioBrick in the Design panel by the right key, some relevant BioBricks will be presented on the top of the BioBrick information. On the bottom, there are some BioBricks you uesd. Meanwhile, some usable BioBrick will be presented behind your current design model, with different color, just like the code autofill in a software IDE.
