Team project descriptions
As the iGEM’s influence increases, a growing number of teams participated in the game, resulting in more and more synthetic biological systems. However, there are few softwares analyzing these systems. Actually, some interesting problems may be solved by analyzing these systems. For example, if we only know parts or complete information of a system’s model, can we determine the function of this system? Another problem is that can existing systems provide useful information for helping designing new systems. Therefore, our aim of developing a software is to solve the above two problems by doing some analysis on existing systems. The first problem will be solved by searching similar systems and the second problem will be addressed by analyzing the models of existing systems.
To achieve our goal, our project has been divided into three. There is a data layer as the basis of system which contains a lot of information about previous teams such as title and abstract, favorite parts and parts sandbox and so on. The middle layer is the business logic layer. It reflects the core value of system architecture. A variety of algorithms are running above it. It was extracted a lot of information, so that useful information could feedback to the user. Top-level module is the view layer which provides the user-friendly interface.
Our software will be a good support system for helping determining unknown systems and designing new systems. It would have high practical value.
