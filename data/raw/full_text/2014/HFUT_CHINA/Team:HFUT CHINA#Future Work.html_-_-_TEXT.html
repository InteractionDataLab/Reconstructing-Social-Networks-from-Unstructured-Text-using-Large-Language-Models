function
Currently, we collect the  device information from teams of previous years. We hope to add the device  information of this year’s team. This would make the recommendation algorithms  more accurate. Besides, we also want to establish a database that contains the  system information, for example, the function of systems, devices that a system  contains, the relationships between devices in the same system. These information  would provide more possibility for our software to recommend. For example,  recommending the devices by function, recommending devices for a system.
Recommendation algorithms:
In the algorithms, we use  hamming distance to measure the similarity of two biobricks. Edit distance  would be a more powerful measurement for similarity. Thus, we would improve the  algorithm by using edit distance.
Besides, our software  currently recommends biobricks for designing devices. We will use the synthetic  systems’ informations to recommend devices. For a given systems, we also want  to detect whether there is something wrong with this system by analyzing  current systems’ information.
Visualization GUI
In the future, we will  allow the software to accept various types of input, such as figures or text. Thus,  when users need to input a whole system, they could use the figures or texts  that have been generated.
