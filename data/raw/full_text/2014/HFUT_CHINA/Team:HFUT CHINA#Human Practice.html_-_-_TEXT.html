Database
In order to support our software, we collected about 3600 device chains  for analysis. All these devices’ information are stored in our database. Besides,  we analyze the associate relationship between biobricks in these chains, and  these associate relationship information are also stored in our database. We shared  this database with developers who want to use these information for analyzing. The  detailed API for database could be found
here
 
Symbols for Biobricks
When implementing our software, we want to visualize the  designed device. Since each biobrick in Registry have a type, the biobricks  with the same type should be visualized with the same symbols. Hence, we  extracted the type information from Registry database, and compared them with  the type information listed by Registry and SBOLv. Table 1 shows the results.

We choose SBOLv symbols to represent the biobricks. As some types in  Registry are actually device, such as Reporter, Generator, DNA, etc, these  types are represented with the same symbol.
