JUDGING FORM
 
1. Demonstrate the relevance of  your development for Synthetic Biology based on standard Parts.
Firstly, our software “BioDesigner” aims to recommending  biobricks for users designing synthetic standard parts. This function will be  very useful for the design of new standard parts by improving the efficiency. Thus,  the function of our software has strong relevance with Synthetic Biology based  on Standard Part.
.
Secondly, the recommendation algorithms used in  BioDesigner is based on the analysis of biobricks of Registry of Standard  Biological Parts. BioDesigner analyzes the associate rule of these biobricks  and the behavior of users. Based on these information, BioDesigner recommends  biobricks for designing of new standard parts. Thus, the algorithms used in our  software have strong relevance with Synthetic Biology based on Standard Part.
Thirdly, the database built in BioDesigner is based on  Registry of Standard Biological Parts. We collect biobrick information, such as  type, sequence, components, etc. Based on the information, BioDesigner analyzes  the associate rules of biobricks. The database stores the collected information  and the analysis information. These information are based on standard parts and  useful for designing new standard parts. Thus, the database bulit in our  software have strong relevance with Synthetic Biology based on Standard Part.
In summary, our  development has strong relevance  with Synthetic Biology based on Standard Part. Our software, BioDesigner,  is really a good tool for iGEM or the whole Synthetic Biology. It will help  users design new stardard parts more efficiently and will be a good assistant.
 
 
2.  iGEM projects involve important questions  beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics,  sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property  rights. Describe an approach that your team used to  address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it  allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific  project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond  iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on  past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.
 
The goal of our software is to help new iGEMers design their own  synthetic biological device. Our software will reduce the difficulty of new  iGEMers’ design and encourage more people to get involved in synthetic biology.
 
Safty: The entire database is from previous teams used parts, so it can  guarantee all of parts have been used before and they are safe enough. The  users can use our software to find out the appropriate ones and it will avoid  the dangerous choice.
 
Sharing: Not only open all of our codes on github, our team also created  an integrate API of our source code which detailed introduce the structure and  function of all the code. So we really hope everyone sharing and developing our  software everywhere!
 
Innovation: Just as we said, our software is the first one which focuses  on the recommendation. The  software will provide some of the results by users’ interests and using frequency.  So it will provide you with a satisfying result.
 
 
3.Make your software interact / interface  with the Registry.
We collected the biobricks information from Registry of Standard parts.  Besides, our software could search Registry to download new biobricks  information for analysis. We also provide a URL for each biobrick stored in our  dabase. These URLs refer to the biobrick website in Registry in case users want  to find detailed biobricks information.
