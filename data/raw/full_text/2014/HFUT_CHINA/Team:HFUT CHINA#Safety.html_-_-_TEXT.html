Your Training
 
Have your team members received any safety training yet?
 
Yes, we have already received safety training.
 
We plan to receive our safety training in the future (approximately when?):
 
We will not have safety training (please comment):
Our team belongs to the software group.We do experiments without any chemicals.So it no need for us to have safety training.
Your Local Rules and  Regulations
 
Who is responsible for biological safety at  your institution? (You might have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, an  Office of Environmental Health and Safety, a single Biosafety Officer, or some  other arrangement.) Have you discussed your project with them? Describe any  concerns they raised, and any changes you made in your project based on your  discussion.
 
Ning An is the central figure in our team. He is responsible for biological safety at our institution. Yes, we have. He told us a lot of safety knowledge. This is very helpful for our future development. Because our team belongs to the software group, their proposal has little effect on our projects
 
What are the biosafety guidelines of your institution?  Please give a link to these guidelines, or briefly describe them if you cannot  give a link.
The guidelines contain a lot of content.The following are examples briefly.When laboratory activities involving pathogenic biological factors, biological risk assessment should be
In your  country, what are the regulations that govern biosafety in research  laboratories? Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them  if you cannot give a link.

Risks of Your Project Now
Please describe  risks of working with the biological materials (cells, organisms, DNA, etc.)  that you are using in your project. If you are taking any safety precautions  (even basic ones, like rubber gloves), that is because your work has some  risks, however small. Therefore, please discuss possible risks and what you  have done (or might do) to minimize them, instead of simply saying that there  are no risks at all.
 
a) Risks to the  safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
Our team belongs to the software group.Our experiments have no risks to any other people.
 
b) Risks to the  safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from  your lab):
Our team belongs to the software group.Our experiments have no risks to any other people.
 
c) Risks to the  environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
Our team belongs to the software group.Our experiments have no risks to the environment.
 
d) Risks to  security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
Our team belongs to the software group.So the malicious mis-use of our project have no risks to the others.
 
e) What  measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices,  choices of which organisms to use.)
Our team belongs to the software group.These risks do not affect us.
Risks of Your Project in the Future
What would happen  if all your dreams came true, and your project grew from a small lab study into  a commercial/industrial/medical product that was used by many people? We invite  you to speculate broadly and discuss possibilities, rather than providing  definite answers. Even if the product is "safe", please discuss  possible risks and how they could be addressed, rather than simply saying that  there are no risks at all.
 
a) What new risks  might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed  in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the  environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you  generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
Our team belongs to the software track.The purpose of the development of this project is to provide ways for the teams to get more useful information. Our project will be getting better and better.
 
b) Does your  project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did  all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you  plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic  chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM  project, but many teams choose to explore them.
Our team belongs to the software group.Measures that we can do to reduce the risk is concentrated in software design.For example, we guarantee the security of the database.
