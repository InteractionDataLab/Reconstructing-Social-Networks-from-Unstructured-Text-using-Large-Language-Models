Meetup In USTC
 
 
From  August 15 to August 17, team HFUT_CHINA attended iGEM 2014 software team meetup to exchange experiences at USTC at the invitation of USTC_SOFTWARE. The attending teams include SYSU, SJTU, XMU, USTC and other professional teams. Meeting included America race simulation, project discussions, software  construction discussions, and casual exchanges.
The opening ceremony was at 9:00 on August 15,  and we did a speech on behalf of the team to show a young and energetic team spirit. In the next Chinese  show, we clearly express our project ideas. The participant teacher appreciates our ideas. They thought it newfangled and it had good prospect.
In English display links, we introduce the project  in fluent English, and what we did could be comparable with other top teams.
Through this meeting, not only did we learn a  lot from others, but also understood the direction of other top software teams,  the gap from the other teams, the future breaking points, enhanced our sense of  urgency. Meanwhile we gained friendship with the team in the depth exchange.
