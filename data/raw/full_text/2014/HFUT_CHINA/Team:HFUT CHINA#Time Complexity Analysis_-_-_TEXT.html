Time Complexity Analysis
The algorithms used in  Biodesigner could be grouped into two categories: preprocessing part and executing  part.
Preprocessing Part
The preprocessing part  includes three algorithms. Here we assume there are n devices and each device  contains at most m biobrickes.
The first one is to count  the probabilities of two successive biobrickes, three successive biobrickes,  four successive biobrickes and five successive biobrickes. Here successive  biobrickes means the biobrickes are neighbors. Thus the number of two successive  biobrickes, three successive biobrickes, four successive biobrickes and five successive  biobrickes are n(m-1),  n(m-2), n(m-3),  n(m-4), respectively. Hash tables are used to store these successive  biobrickes. Therefore, the probabilities could be obtained by scanning the  device chains four times. Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(2n(m-1)+3n(m-2)+4n(m-3)+5n(m-3))=O(nm).   
The second one is to count  the probabilities of the first biobrick of each device chain. This work could  be done by scanning the first biobrick of each chain. Thus, the complexity of  this algorithm is O(n).
The third one is to  calculate the hamming distances of each paired biobrickes.  Since there are n device chains and each  device contains at most m biobrickes. Therefore, there are at most nm  biobrickes, which means there are at most nm*nm paired biobrickes. The  calculation of hamming distances between two sequences with length l could be  done in O(l) time. Thus, the complexity of this algorithm is O(l*nm*nm)=O(ln2m2).
Hence, the time complexity  of preprocessing part is O(nm)+O(n)+O(ln2m2) =O(ln2m2).
Executing Part
The executing part contains  two algorithms. Here we assume the given device chain contains at most m  biobrickes.
The first one is to  inquire the probabilities of two successive biobrickes, three successive  biobrickes, four successive biobrickes and five successive biobrickes of a  given device chain. Since all the data is stored in a hash table and the access  of hash table needs O(1) time. Thus, the time complexity of this algorithm is  O(m).
The second one is to store  the given device chain. This work is done by store the two successive  biobrickes, three successive biobrickes, four successive biobrickes and five successive  biobrickes of the given device chain into the hash table. Thus, the time  complexity of this algorithm is O(m).
Hence, the time complexity  of executing part is O(m).
Note, we only need to  execute the preprocessing part once. After the execution of preprocessing part,  all the data is store in database. When using our software, users do not need  to waste their time for the preprocessing part as it has been executed.
