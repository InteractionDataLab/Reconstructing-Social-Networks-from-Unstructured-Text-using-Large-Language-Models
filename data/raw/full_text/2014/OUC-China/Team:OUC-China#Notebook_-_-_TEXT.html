WEEK 1
We acquired foundational knowledge as preparation for our project.Under the guidance of teachers and fellow students, we studied molecular biology and synthetic biology.
WEEK 2
Then we learned molecular experiments, included bacterination, plasmid miniprep, agarose electrophoresis, enzyme digestion, gel extraction, ligation, transformation, bacterial coating, PCR and so on.
WEEK 3
We acquired plasmid RP4 fromother lab,professor QIU Zhigang provided us HB101 strain which contains plasmid RP4. After getting HB101 strain, we tested the plasmid in several ways. In the end, the test results show the plasmid is exactly what we want. Firstly, through resistance screening experiment to determine if the types of antibiotics genes carried by the plasmid are consistent with literature. Secondly, getting the vital sequence from the plasmid by means of PCR to confirm whether the plasmid is RP4 or not.Thirdly, by doing conjugation experiment to test if the plasmid could conjugate with other strains.
We built a plasmid which used pet32a as backbone and the gene sequence of TAT-H4, and then we transformed it into BL21 (DE3).
Experiment:
a) Transform：transform our plasmid into BL21(DE3) and culture it on LB solid medium.
b) Plasmid miniprep: plasmid extraction from BL21 (DE3).
c) Agarose electrophoresis: detect length of the extracted plasmid, it’s about 6000bp so the it confirms the correctness of the result.
d) Culture: HB101 strain wasscreened by ampicillin and kanamycinrespectivelyin LB broth. And both bottles of
broth were turbid.
e) plasmid miniprep: plasmid extraction from HB101.
f) agaroseelectrophoresis: detect length of the extracted plasmid, and the result is right.
g) PCR: after repeated experiment, we get the vital sequence, traF and trbIfrom plasmid RP4.
h) Agaroseelectrophoresis: detect the plasmid PCR product, and it is consistent with the expected result.
i) Conjugation: The donor strain was HB101 with the plasmid RP4. Then, we usednalidixic acidas screening condition and use JM109 as recipient cell, but failed.So we used streptomycin as screening condition and use Top10 as recipient cell.As expected, the result was right.
WEEK 4
We designed PCR primers of oriTRP4 sequence with restriction endonuclease cleavage sitesEcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI.After getting the fragment, we madeDNA sequencing for oriT region of RP4. In addition, the sequencing result of oriT region turned out right.
We cultured the BL21(DE) which containing the pet32a plasmid at 37℃.We constantly measured the OD values of the broth, and when the values of the OD is within 0.2-0.6,we added the broth with IPTG(Its concentration is 1Mm) for 12h.After that, we make the bacterial lysis and release all protein. By using SDS we found that the bacteria after induction produce another kind of protein (33KD) compared with the contrast group, this is in line with our expectations.
