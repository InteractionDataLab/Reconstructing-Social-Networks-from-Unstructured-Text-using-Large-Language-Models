Brainstorming and research
All 15 team members participated in the brainstorming and research, under the guidance of former team members.
Team member Wenqi Li came up with the original idea for the double plasmid system and Zhaoliang Chen came up with the original idea for the transfection of Eukarya.
Instructor Xiaohua Zhang and Guanpin Yang gave us a lot of suggestions.
Lab work
Wet lab work was divided into two parts: construction of the double plasmid system and transfection of Eukarya.
The double plasmid group consists of Wenqi Li, Tianli Hu, Guang Xu, Ming Jiang, Yanyan Song.
The transfection group consists of Zhaoliang Chen, Junqiang Zheng, Miao Shi, Tianqi Ouyang, Wencong Shi.
There are 10 wet lab members in total.
Advisor Xianghong Wang and Huarong Guo provided us with laboratory support and experimental consumables.
Safety
Subjects on safety were discussed among the team. Safety form was finished by Tianli Hu.
Lab management was carried out by Wenqi Li, Miao shi.
Modeling
Dry lab member consists of Lei Yu, Wenxin Bi, Bingrong Sun. They established the model for the lysis device.
Doc.
Wiki design
Wiki was designed by Beidi Zhao, Bo li, Guang Xu and assisted by all members.
Human Practice
Team OUC-China always observes active performance in the field of human practice.
This year, human practice group consists of Tianli Hu, Ming Jiang, Guang Xu, Zhaoliang Chen, Miao Shi.
Funding
Tianli Hu handled all of the team’s expenses, while Ming Jiang, Guang Xu sought funding through various means.
