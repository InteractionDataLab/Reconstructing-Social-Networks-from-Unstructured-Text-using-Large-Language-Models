Our members are from different colleges, majoring in biology, biochemistry, ecology etc. Our team got together, trying to figure out what we could do with synthetic biology. At the beginning of our project, we were all unfamiliar with other members and subjects, and were not sure of what would happen. But we encouraged each other, worked together, and finally overcame difficulties. At the end of this project, we were so proud of the effort we made during the process, and grateful for everyone's work. Now, iGEM is a family to us all.</P><P>We appreciate all our instructors and advisors who have assisted us throughout the project. We also appreciate all the others who provided valuable advice and essential materials for the project. If it were not for their help, the project would not have been so successful.</P><DIV id="JiangMing" class="member"><DIV class="popover right" style="margin-top:80px"><H3 class="popover-title">Jiang Ming</H3><DIV class="popover-content"><P>Major: Ecology</P><P>

                        Feelings: Working on this wiki project is a challenge for me. In fact I don't understand why iGEM uses mediawiki to build their website, because wiki framework is not very suitable in this scene. But it's a chance for me to learn how to use this type of wiki framework, so I think it may not be disappointing at all.
