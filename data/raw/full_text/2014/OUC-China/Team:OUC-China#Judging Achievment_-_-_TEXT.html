Bronze Medal
√ 1、We successfully registered the team, had a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
√ 2、We successfully completed and submitted this iGEM 2014 Judging form.
√ 3、We created and shared a description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
√ 4、We plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Silver Medal
√ 1、Our new BioBrick Parts were design by our members and they can work as expected.
√ 2、We characterized our part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry including information and behavior.
√ 3、We submitted our new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
√ 4、We did some work in investigation, and we promoted team communication and summer camps beyond the bench.
Gold Medal
√ 1、We helped Peking iGEM team. We activated and sent two standard biological parts of gas vesicle genes, GvpA and GvpC to Peking iGEM team. And we have helped Peking to test the function of the two parts to make bacteria float.
√ 2、During the work time, we did investigations about biological products transport and vaccines about our project.
In our policy & practice project we achieved……
1.Last November, we went to Peking University to have an academic communication with 2013 Peking iGEM team.
2.Consulted professor on several problems in Qingdao Institute of Biomass Energy and Bioprocess Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Besides, Dr. Huang made a professional lecture about digital simulation and bioapplication, and provided us with advice on modeling.
3.Invited Beijing Normal University iGEM team to our university. We had a discussion on our projects, and we exchanged gifts to each other.
4.Held the Fourth Science and Technology camp for new sophomores and passed some knowledge of synthetic biology to them. We also held a mini jamboree for them.
5.Attended the Central China iGEMers' Consortium (C C i C) held in Wuhan, China. We presented our project and communicated with others teams in China.
6.We activated and sent two standard biological parts of gas vesicle genes, GvpA and GvpC to Peking iGEM team. And we have helped Peking to test the function of the two parts to make bacteria float.
7.To evaluate our project's application in future, we visited the fish farms and consulted the engineers about the ways of curing and precaution in terms of fish diseases. Besides, we also visited Hu Haibin who is the most authoritative expert in aquaculture feeds in China. And we got information about coated pellet technology. If we combined coated pellet technology with our project, we could apply the feed with outer coating on the ornamental fish industry.
8.In terms of the transportation of biological products, we finished the investigation, and we gave our solutions to the problems.
In terms of the double plasmids system
1.Test of the conjugation ability of BBa_J01003.
2.Construction of the parts: BBa_K1439000 , BBa_K1439001 , BBa_K1439002 , BBa_K1439003.
3.Construction of the mini plasmid (OriTRP4-BBa_J04450-pSB1C3).
4.Proved that the mini plasmid can't transfer if there is no plasmid RP4.
5.Constructed the double plasmid system with mini plasmid (OriTRP4-BBa_J04450-pSB1C3) and plasmid RP4. And proved that the mini plasmid can transfer between cells with the help of RP4.
6.Proof of conjugation between E.Coli HB101 and Vibrio harveyi.
In terms of Transfection
1.We successfully proved that our recombinant plasmid (pet32a) can produce the H4::TAT protein as we expected.
2.We successfully extracted and purified fusion protein, proving the protect function of DNA.
3.Via RT-PCR experiments, we successfully proved that the protein and plasmid complex could transfect into fish.
