WEEK 5
We learned knowledge of biological modeling,and communicated with the previous team.
WEEK 6
We reviewed the use of mathematical software,and communicated with the researchers in Chinese academy of sciences,Qingdao institute of bioenergy and process.
WEEK 7
We analysed the reaction mechanism in various steps of the experiment and looked for suitable mathematical models to describe.
WEEK 8
We preprocessed the experimental data.
WEEK 9
We tried to find equations to describe the process of the experiment and decided to build their own models after reading a large number of literatures.
WEEK 10
We extracted and improved our own differential equation model.After matching with the experimental results, a reasonable equation model was finally determined.
WEEK 11
We Started to work on the wiki about the model part, and thought about the shortage of the existing model and then promote the model.
WEEK 12
We further modified the model and finished it.
