Origin of transfer for the RP4-plasmid nic region
ID: BBa_K1439000
Type: conjugation
Length:350bp
Description/Usage: OriTRP4,the RP4 plasmid nic region,is where the relaxosome nicks the plasmid and conjugative transfer by RP4 plasmid machinery begins.
[OriTRP4]+[RFP]
ID: BBa_K1439001
Type: Composite
Length:1427bp
Description/Usage: This part contains a reporter gene BBa_J04450, combined with OriTRP4. Used to test plasmid mobility.
[OriTR]+[RFP]
ID: BBa_K1439002
Type: Composite
Length:1448bp
Description/Usage: This part contains a reporter gene BBa_J04450, combined with OriTR. Used to test plasmid mobility.
hEF1a_Cas9-VP16 MammoBlock
ID: BBa_K1179003
Type: Generator
Length: 5141bp
Description/Usage: This part encodes the expression of the fusion protein Cas9-VP16 that is used in activating a minimal CMV promoter with guide RNA binding sites upstream.
TAT-H4
ID: BBa_K1439004
Type: Coding
Length:393bp
Description/Usage: This part codes the expression of the fusion protein TAT-H4 that is used in combing and protecting the plasmid in bacterium and helping the plasmid transfect into the eukaryocyte.
TAT-PTD
ID: BBa_K1439005
Type: Coding
Length:33bp
Description/Usage: This part codes the expression of the TAT-PTD that is used in helping the plasmid transfect into the eukaryocyte.
Histone H4
ID: BBa_K1439006
Type: Coding
Length:312bp
Description/Usage: This part codes the expression of the Histone H4 that is used in combing and protecting the plasmid in bacterium.
CMV promoter
ID: BBa_K1439007
Type: Regulatory
Length:588bp
Description/Usage: We use CMV to improve the expression of TAT:H4 and the efficiency of transfection.
TAT-H4-B0015
ID: BBa_K1439008
Type: Composite
Length:530bp
Description/Usage: This part codes the expression of the fusion protein TAT-H4 that is used in combing and protecting the plasmid in bacterium and helping the plasmid transfect into the eukaryocyte. It has a terminator and can be added different promoters.
Lysis device induced by L-arabinose
ID: BBa_K1439009
Type: Device
Length:1923bp
Description/Usage:This part encodes the expression of the lysis protein that is induced by L-arabinose mobility.
Lysis device induced by aTc
ID: BBa_K1439010
Type: Device
Length:2738bp
Description/Usage:This is the lysis device using three genes from enterobacteria phage T4: lysozyme, holin, and antiholin.Tet promoter can control the lysis of bacteria.
