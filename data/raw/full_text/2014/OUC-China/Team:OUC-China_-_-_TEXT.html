Introduction
Current researches usually transfer exogenous DNA into prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells, while OUC-China iGEM team has designed an innovative method to carry exogenous DNA from prokaryote to eukaryota more efficiently. Eventually we have applied the method to studies of the model organism, zebrafish.
We have constructed the fusion protein that can bind and protect plasmids, with the ability of helping plasmids transfect into eukaryotic cells in high efficiency.
