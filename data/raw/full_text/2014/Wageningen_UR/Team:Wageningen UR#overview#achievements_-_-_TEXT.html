Achievements
We further eleborate on all the requirements needed for each Medal.
Bronze
Registered for iGEM
Completed judging form
Designed a Wiki describing the BananaGuard project
Present a poster and talk at the iGEM jamboree
Documented attributions
Documented and submitted 27 BioBricks to the iGEM Registry
Met criteria for bronze
Silver
Validated and submitted the following BioBricks from our own project: Fusaric acid dependent promoter (Bba_K1493000) which was never before proven to be a fusaric acid promoter and this year we have proven that. Pfri ( Bba_K1493200 ) that has shown to have pyoverdine production even when there is iron in the medium. And the new promoters for the Kill-Switch ( Bba_K1493801 , Bba_K1493802 , Bba_K1493804 , Bba_K1493805 and Bba_K1493806 ) which are promoters containing different inhibitor binding sites and have shown to work!
Characterized the following Biobricks from our own project: Fusaric acid dependent promoter (Bba_K1493000) , pfri ( Bba_K1493200 )
Considered safety in our project by implementing a Kill-Switch system and a system to prevent horizontal gene transfer . By implementing these systems we will reduce the environmental impact of BananaGuard
Collaborated with Synenergene and discussed many safety-concerning topics in synthetic biology. We also created techno-moral scenarios based on our project
Met all criteria for silver
Gold
Improved the functions of existing BioBrick promoter parts ( BBa_K914003 and BBa_K909012 ) by an extensive characterization using GFP fluorescence measurement. New BioBricks were made by assembling these promoters with GFP ( BBa_K1493501 and BBa_K1493502 )
Collaborated with iGEM TU_Delft-Leiden from the Netherlands by quantifying the modified biofilm, formed in E. coli
Organized the first National conference with Dutch iGEM teams and anticipated a collaboration with the Dutch Institute of Health and Environment (RIVM)
A symposium and a panel session and a panel session was organized to inform government officials about the risks and possibilities of synthetic biology, sparking the public discussion about the use of synthetic biology
To spread the word about our research and to improve the product application, we interviewed and discussed our project with the leading banana plant scientists at Wageningen University, contacted an agronomic engineer from the Canary Islands, a stakeholder from the Philippines and talked to consumers whose everyday diet includes bananas
In addition we also participated in the interlab study
Met all criteria for gold
