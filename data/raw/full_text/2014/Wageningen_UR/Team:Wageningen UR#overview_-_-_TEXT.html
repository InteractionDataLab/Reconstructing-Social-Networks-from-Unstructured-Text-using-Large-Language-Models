Overview
iGEM Wageningen 2014 has created BananaGuard, a genetically modified Pseudomonas putida capable of fighting against Fusarium oxysporum, a fungus that threatens banana production globally.
Background
Panama disease is caused by Fusarium and is threatening the banana production worldwide.
Solution
BananaGuard is able to  detect Fusarium in the soil, inhibit fungal growth and self-destruct afterwards.
Results
We have built a fusaric acid dependent promoter, kill-switch parts, antifungals, modeled BananaGuard and much more ...
Achievements
We have met all the requirements for the bronze, silver and gold medals!
BioBricks
Find out all about the BioBrick parts we made and improved!
