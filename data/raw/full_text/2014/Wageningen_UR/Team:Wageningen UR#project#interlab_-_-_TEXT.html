Interlab Measurement Study
All competing iGEM teams were encouraged to participate in a inter lab study in which fluorescence from three specific devices expressing GFP was measured in labs all around the world.  The devices all express GFP but under promoters with different strengths and the plasmids harbouring them differ in copy number. The measurements taken by all different iGEM laboratories should result in a set of comparable data. In synthetic biology consistency of standardized parts is the ultimate goal. This study will grand us deeper insight into the variability of standard measurements.
iGEM team Wageningen 2014 decided to join the interlab study and on top of building and measuring the required GFP devices, equivalent devices were built containing RFP for comparison.
Device 1 - J23101 - B0032 - E0040 - B0015 in pSB3K3
Device 2 - J23101 - B0032 - E0040 - B0015 in pSB1C3
Device 3 - J23115 - B0032 - E0040 - B0015 in pSB1C3
For the RFP parts, BBa_E0040 was replaced by BBa_E1010 .
Figure 1. Fluorescence data measured for the interlab study. Although differences in GFP expression are clearly visible, RFP does not show a clear change in expression.
