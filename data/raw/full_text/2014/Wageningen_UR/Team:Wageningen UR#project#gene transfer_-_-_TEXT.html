Horizontal Gene Transfer Inhibition
Overview
One of the main threats when releasing genetically modified organisms (GMO) in the soil is the possibility of horizontal gene transfer [1]. This is the transfer of plasmid DNA and thereby non-natural genetic content to native bacteria in the environment. Therefore, in this project a double plasmid interdependent Toxin-Antitoxin (T-A) system has been designed to stop horizontal gene transfer between our system and the native soil bacteria. Both plasmids of the designed system contain a toxin and an antitoxin. The toxin has its corresponding antitoxin on the other plasmid, making the system interdependent (Figure 1). Through this interdependence a bacterium will need both plasmids (or none) to survive. If a native soil bacterium received a single plasmid it would die. The possibility of the two plasmids to be transferred simultaneously is very improbable yet possible; however, this system makes gene transfer much less likely to occur than any other known system. An additional advantage of this system is the ability to maintain the GMO population by positive selection. As losing a plasmid is metabolically attractive for the GMO but also deadly, the system would make the population retain their plasmids.
Two sets of T-A  combinations, Kid-Kis and Zeta-Epsilon which have been studied for biosafety purposes before [2], were selected for this project. Both are type II T-A systems, meaning that antitoxin protein prevents the toxin protein from functioning by binding.
Figure 1. Mode of action of the double interdependent plasmid system that prevents horizontal gene transfer between BananaGuard (green bacteria) and native bacteria in the soil (yellow bacteria). In case one of the plasmids would be transfered to soil bacteria, it would kill the recipient due to expression of one of the toxins.
Epsilon and Zeta
The Epsilon (antitoxin) and Zeta (toxin) were first found on pSM19035, a plasmid originating from Streptococcus pyogenes [3]. The T-A cassettes in plasmids such as pSM19035 have the biological function to stabilize plasmids, maintaining the plasmid in non-selective conditions. The Zeta toxin converts an essential building block of the bacterial cell wall into a form that prevents normal cell wall growth. Due to the distorted cell wall the bacterial cell becomes prone to hydrostatic pressure, leading to cell lysis with comparable effects to penicillin [4]. Epsilon antitoxin forms a complex with the Zeta toxin disabling the toxins function, with an expected ratio of 1:1 [4]. Zeta toxin has been proven to be bactericidal for gram-positive Bacillus subtillis and bacteriostatic for gram-positive E. coli [3]. Nonetheless, more recent works show that Zeta toxins are also bactericidal for E. coli [4].
Kis and Kid
Kis (antitoxin) and Kid (toxin) are part of the parD stability system of plasmid R1 acting as a pre-segregation mechanism to ensure plasmid proliferation. Kid breaks down single stranded messenger RNAs. By degradation of something as vital as messenger RNA, this toxin does not differ in function with gram positive and gram negative bacteria. In nature, Kid causes cells to divide slower to ensure that every daughter cell receives the R1 plasmid. In our system an excess of Kid will result in a bactericidal effect. Additionally, the Kis-Kid interaction has proven to be a 1:2 ratio [5, 6].
Final design and system specifications
The T-A system is intertwined with both the Kill-Switch and our host Pseudomonas putida. The toxins were designed to be part of the Kill-Switch, making use of the required balance between toxins and antitoxins. The activation of the Kill-Switch after induction and subsequent absence of fusaric acid will cause the toxins to be produced, disrupting the T-A balance, resulting in cell death. There are different theories on the T-A system putative functions that are not mutually exlusive. Besides plasmid retention, increasing evidence suggests that the T-A systems can act like a hysteric switch, in which a fraction of the population can enter a toxic state. In this toxin state the free toxins inhibit cell growth transforming the cells into persistent cells. In this slow growing persistent state the organisms become more robust to external fluctuations allowing it to survive in unfavorable environments [7,8]. Many micro-organisms contain multiple toxin-antitoxin systems, six T-A systems are predicted for P. putida. As free toxins have an impact on the growth of our host this characteristic has been taken up in the system performance model in order to describe the system as accurately as possible.
Approach, constructing BioBricks
Cloning the T-A systems in pSB1C3
The first step to build the toxins and antitoxin BioBricks was a PCR amplification and elongation to add a Ribosomal Binding Sites (RBS) to the individual toxins and antitoxins and incorporate standard overhangs for RFC10 assembly , containing the BioBrick prefix and suffix. Two plasmids, pHT286 and pAB24, containing Zeta-Epsilon and Kis-Kid respectively, were obtained from Imperial Imperial College London (ICL) ACS Synthetic Biology [2]. After successful amplification and elongation, the toxins and antoxins were cloned in the standard iGEM backbone pSB1C3 with and without the LacI promoter BBa_R0010 .
Toxins and antitoxins cloned in pSB1C3 containing and not containing the LacI promoter were transformed into commercially DH5a cells. Moreover, toxins and antitoxins containing the LacI promoter were transformed into E. coli JM109, that expresses the LacI repressor, and therefore can inhibit the production of toxin, a desirable effect to avoid the death of the cell by their toxic effect.
Cloning the toxins in a low copy number plasmid in combination with the antitoxins
An alternative approach was taken, cloning the two toxins in low copy number plasmids in electro competent cells containing the antitoxins in the pSB1C3 backbone. To chose the most appropriate backbone we made a complete study of the different Origin of Replication (Ori) of the iGEM standard backbones becasue our team members was experiencing problems in finding an actual low copy number plasmid in the registry. Results indicated that the only real low copy number plasmid is pSB3K3, which contains the p15A Ori (clik here for detailed results). Also different resistance marker was required to select for two plasmids in the same cell, being chloramphenicol and ampicillin.
Separating toxins and antitoxins.
Once having obtained the toxins cloned in pSB3K3, our aim was to separate the toxins and antitoxins using agarose gel electrophoresis and showing that toxins and antitoxins sequences were completely separated.

Results and discussion
Cloning the T-A systems in pSB1C3
Building BioBricks for the double interdependent T-A system was a challenging task because the toxins, as the name implies, are toxic to the cell. Colonies were obtained both for toxins and antitoxins, but when verified by restriction digestion, only the antitoxins were obtained in both types of cells E. coli DH5a and JM109 (Figure 2). The most probable reason for this results is that the LacI promoter is leaky and that even without a promoter the toxins are transcribed and translated being toxic for the cell, causing the cloned DNA to rearrange and lose the toxin coding part. Kis and Epsilon antitoxins, can be found in the registry under the code BBa_K1493602 and BBa_K1493603 .
On the other hand, when cloning the antitoxins in pSB1C3 without the LacI promoter, only the Kis antitoxin was successfully obtained ( BBa_K1493601 ).
Figure 2. Restriction enzyme digestion gel (XbaI and PstI) of transformed plasmids in both E. coli DH5a and JM109 cells, antitoxins (Kis and Epsilon) were successfully cloned while toxins (Kid and Kis) only showed a 200 bp band corresponding to the LacI promoter. Expected digestion sizes: Kis 301 bp, Kid 376 bp, Zeta 907 bp, Epsilon 316 bp, LacI promoter 200 bp, Kis + pLacI 501 bp, Epsilon + pLacI 516 bp and pSB1C3 2070 bp.
Cloning the toxins in a low copy number plasmid in combination with the antitoxins
Following the previous results, the toxins (Zeta and Kid) were transformed in E. Coli containing the antitoxins, Epsilon and Kid. When taking this approach, successful restriction digestion of the combination of both plasmids, showed the presence of the toxin and antitoxins (Figure 3) in JM109 E. Coli cells, that contain the LacI repressor.

As indicated in the right part of the gel image, all the expected fragments can be identified in the gel. Expected digestion sizes: Kis 301 bp, Kid 376 bp, Epsilon 316 bp, Zeta 907 bp, LacI promoter 200 bp, Kis + pLacI 501 bp, Kid + pLacI 577 bp, Epsilon + pLacI 517 bp, Zeta + pLacI 1.108 bp, pSB1C3 2070 bp and pSB3K3 2750 bp
Separating toxins and antitoxins.
Once obtained the cells with the combination of toxins and antitoxins, we aimed to separate them by gel electrophoresis. We evaluate the most optimal setup to determine the optimum agarose percentage, voltage and time of electrophoresis. The plasmids were physically separated, as can be seen in Figure 4, the high copy number plasmid (pSB1C3) is smaller in size, therefore, runs further and has a higher intensity. Toxin bands for Kid and Zeta were extracted and purified from the gel and a PCR to check for the presence of the antitoxins was performed. The results showed that the isolated toxins still had amplification bands corresponding to the antitoxins. Due to lack of time no further steps were performed to continue building the double plasmid interdependent T-A system. Nonetheless, we introduced in the iGEM registry the antitoxin parts of the Kis-Kid and Epsilon-zeta in three different BioBricks BBa_K1493601 , BBa_K1493602 and BBa_K1493603 .
Figure 4. Electrophoresis gel to separate Kis in pSB1C3 and Kid in pSB1K3. As expected, circular plasmid DNA runs in the gel different than the 2 log DNA ladder seen in the first lane. The expected sizes of 2.545 bp for Kis in pSB1C3 and 3.308 bp for Kid in pSB3K3 do not correspond wiht the ladder.
Conclusions
This project aimed to build a double interdependent system to prevent the horizontal gene transfer between BananaGuard and other native bacteria in the soil. The designed system is an innovative approach to avoid horizontal gene transfer. The two main advantages over other biosafety existing systems are that the GMO dies if the plasmid is lost and that the system itself regulates when passing it after division. Moreover, cell viability depends mainly on the balance between two T-A systems and no genome integration is needed. As working with toxins is a challenging work because cells die immediately after toxin cloning, several repetitions and setups were required to successfully built BioBricks for Kis and Epsilon, the antitoxins of the system. Interestingly, we could only clone the toxins in low copy number plasmid (pSB3K3) in combination with the antitoxins, but no successful separation was achieved.
Future work
Future steps should focus on cloning the toxins in a low copy number plasmid without the promoter and, later, clone them behind the promoter and antitoxins of the  same T-A pair and with the other, in order to test the whole final system (Figure 1). Moreover, it would be useful to use a less leaky promoter than LacI, like the Rhamnose promoter, especially for the toxins which will decrease cell toxicity. Moreover, as a final step, this system should also be transformed in P. putida and integrated with all the other BananaGuard modules.
