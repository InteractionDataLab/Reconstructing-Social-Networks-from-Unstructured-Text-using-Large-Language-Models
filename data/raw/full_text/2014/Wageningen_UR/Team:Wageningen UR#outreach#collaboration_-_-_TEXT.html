Collaboration
As an iGEM team we’ve collaborated with other teams on several occasions. We organized the Dutch National Meetup and later in the year we went to the Groningen Meetup. At these meetups a lot of ideas were exchanged and feedback was given on each other’s projects and presentations. On top of that we organised a national symposium for Dutch policy makers in cooperation with the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) . On this day all Dutch iGEM teams worked together to lead discussion and inform people about the possibilities of Synthetic Biology.
Finally, we collaborated with the Delft-Leiden iGEM team to do a mutual characterisation of each other’s BioBricks. We conducted biofilm assays while Delft measured our repressible promotors for the Kill-Switch.
Biofilm assay - TU Delft-Leiden
An assay based on absorption of Congo red was used to quantify biofilm production for three BioBricks from Delft-Leiden iGEM team .
BBa_K1316013 (CC50)
BBa_K1316014 (CC51)
BBa_K1316015 (CC52)
The protocol used can be found here.
Figure 1. Biofilm production after 23.5 hours of growth at 37°C. Lower A480/OD600 corresponds with a higher amount of biofilm produced. All three transformants show increased biofilm production when induced with 0.8% rhamnose, while the wild type stays constant.
For more complete information on the functionality and final results of these BioBricks, check out the TU-Delft-Leiden results page.
