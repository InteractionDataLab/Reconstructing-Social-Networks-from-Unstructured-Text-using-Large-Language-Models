Team
Our team consists of twelve banana-loving students from Wageningen University who dedicated their whole summer to explore the world of synthetic biology and fight the Panama disease. We combine the strengths of our different backgrounds, studies and home-countries to excel in the lab and even exceed the sum of our combined powers.
