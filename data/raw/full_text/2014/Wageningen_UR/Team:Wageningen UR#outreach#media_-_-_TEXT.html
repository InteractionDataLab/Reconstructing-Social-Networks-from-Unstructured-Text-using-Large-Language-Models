Media and outreach
Over the summer period we approached the media to inform the public on the iGEM 2014 Wageningen project. These attempts have resulted in a number of successful press releases:
Wageningen University magazine named Resource has written an in depth piece on the Wageninen iGEM project. The article features both our project and our personal experience of iGEM.
The intranet of Wageningen featured an article on the project. The article focused heavily on the different aspects of our biological control agent. The article aimed to inform the Wageningen community on the workings of iGEM and the specifics of our project.
An interview was given to the C2W magazine , a magazine edited by the Royal Dutch Chemical Association (KNCV) . Featuring the key excerpts from the interview, the entire project was outlined and aimed to update the biotechnology community in the Netherlands and Belgium regarding iGEM.
We were interviewed for an in depth study on the on the social acceptance of our product with Zowi Mens and Joost Flach from the University of Amsterdam . They were in particular interested in understanding our view on the social aspects.
