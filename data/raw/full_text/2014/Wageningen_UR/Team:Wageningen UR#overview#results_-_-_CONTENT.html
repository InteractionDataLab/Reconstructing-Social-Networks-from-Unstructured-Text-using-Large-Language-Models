By combining both experimental and modelling techniques, we have designed, implemented and tested a system that protects banana plants from <I>Fusarium oxysporum</I>. The BananaGuard system senses fusaric acid and, in response, produces fungal growth inhibitors to prevent infection of the banana plant. In addition we have also implemented a Kill-switch that disables our system when fusaric acid is not present. For this, we have optimized the circuit design, assessed the potential of BananaGuard in the soil, and analyzed the robustness of the system using different mathematical models.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION> Figure 1: The BananaGuard time line. After application, BananaGuard will: 1. detect <I>F. oxysporum</I> based on fusaric acid secretion; 2. produce fungal growth inhibitors, and; 3. destroy itself when <I>F. oxysporum</I> cannot be detected anymore. </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></SECTION><SECTION id="sensing"><H2>Sensing</H2><P>While fusaric acid dependent protection systems have been observed in micro-organisms and predicted <I>in silico</I> after genome sequencing, no evidence of a validated fusaric acid dependent promoter could be found in the literature. In this project we characterised and validated such a promoter. A putative fusaric acid dependent promoter along with its hypothesized regulator (isolated from <I>Pseudomonas putida</I> KT2440 (<I>P. putida</I>)) were cloned in front of GFP <A class="soft_link" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_E0040">(BBa_E0040)</A>, transformed in <I>P. putida</I> KT2440. Promoter function was quantified by measuring fluorescence in the presence of different fusaric acid concentrations (figure 2). We were able to validate and characterize a novel fusaric acid dependent promoter <A class="soft_link" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1493000">(Bba_K1493000)</A>.
							<FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Figure 6. *Significantly different from WT with p&lt;0.05The measurement is based on GFP fluorescence in <I>P. putida</I> at increased concentrations of fusaric acid to prove and characterize the activity of the fusaric acid induced promoter, <A class="soft_link" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1493000">BBa_K1493000</A>. For comparison, the well characterized pLac promoter (<A class="soft_link" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K741002">BBa_K741002</A>, uninduced by IPTG) was used to quantify the activity of this promoter at different concentrations of fusaric acid. Our fusaric acid inducible promoter does not respond to low concentrations up to 170µM. From 255µM and up, the activity increases. The maximum measured activity of the promoter is 0.21 RPU at 425µM. </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P><P>For more information, read <A class="soft_link" href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR/project/fungal_sensing">fungal sensing</A>.</P></SECTION><SECTION id="inhibition"><H2>Inhibition</H2><P>Upon sensing fusaric acid, three genes and a gene cluster will be activated that will lead to production of fungal growth inhibitors.

With both BiobBicks validated, and for PfrI characterized. PfrI has shown to give a four fold increase of pyoverdine production in the presence of iron (31μM) in the growth medium. Pyoverdine is a compound that chelates iron and is naturally only produced when there is no iron available.</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION>Figure 3.

							</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>In general, it was hard to distinguish the increased inhibition effect of the fungal growth inhibitors producing <I>P. putida</I> against <I>F. oxysporum</I>. This is because the <I>P. putida</I> chassis we have chosen is already very good at inhibiting <I>F. oxysporum</I> naturally, which probably makes it hard to observe increased growth inhibition by our synthetic, growth inhibitor producing <I>P. putida</I> strains. However, with the Methionine-γ-lyase(MgL) strain, we have a clear indication that there is an enhanced growth inhibition of <I>F. oxysporum</I> (figure 4).We can say that there is an indication of a slight increase of growth inhibition, on top of the natural inhibitionin, the 2,4-DAPG, chitinase and pyoverdine producing strains.

Therefore we have implemented a Kill-switch into our system, which works like a toggle switch that senses when fusaric acid is around, and when it has dissipated toxins will be produced that eliminate BananaGuard. Toxins will be produced that eliminate BananaGuard itself, with the kill switch regulatory system in figure 4. </P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION> Figure 5. the overview of the Kill-switch regulatory system showing al possible repressions. To simplify things in wetlab rhamnose input (white dots) is used instead of fusaric acid and GFP output (green dots) is used instead of toxins.
 </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>CIλ (induced by rhamnose) has shown to suppress the pcIλ/Tet promoter inhibiting GFP production when induced with rhamnose (figure 5). 
							In addition, CIλ and lacI has also shown to suppress GFP production of the pCIλ/lacI promoter (figure 6). A toggle-switch was constructed (<A class="soft_link" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1493702"> Bba_K1493702</A>, <A class="soft_link" href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1493703"> Bba_K1493703</A>) containing pCIλ/lacI promoter + TetR together with pTet + LacI + GFP. After establishing that induction by IPTG leads to adequately low GFP expression (the off-state), whereas induction by aTc results in high GFP expression (the on-state).The non induced state of the toggle switch shows a fluorescence value between the two induced states, indicating that it might be stable.

Cells were grown in M9 medium with 2% glycerol and induced with 0%, 0.001%, 0.01%, 0.05% or 0.2% L-rhamnose or 0.2% glucose at t=0. Fluorescence was measured over time and data of time point 8.13 are shown in the graphs. Rhamnose concentrations of 0.001% and 0.01% have no substantial effect on fluorescence, compared to 0% rhamnose. Cells grown in 0.05% and 0.2% rhamnose show a lower RFU value compared to 0% rhamnose indicating that the pCI/lac is repressed by the repressor protein regulated by the rhamnose promoter. 0.2% glucose has an effect on the RFU, as the values are lower than 0% rhamnose.

							In order to characterize promoters that are non-inducible we developed a new characterization method that is based on a rhamnose inducible promter. We used this system to characterize a promoter repressed cIλ repressor and LacI repressor (figure 7.)

 </FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><H3>Promoter design model</H3><P>The kill-switch design is relatively intricate and therefore requires <I>in silico</I> analysis in order to test and improve its architecture. In order to perform such analysis we exploited statistical mechanics to derive a model of the promoter system. Not unexpectedly, the new insight obtained strongly favoured some adaptations to the current design, which included reallocation of promoters as well as parallel placement of an additional kill-switch, which according to the predictions would yield a more stable system.
