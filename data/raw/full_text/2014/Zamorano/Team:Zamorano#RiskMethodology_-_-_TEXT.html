ERA, Environmental Risk Assessment
I) Context definition.- Its intention is to show a general panorama of the situation. It contains national and international laws, the objectives of the Project, the goals of the Project, the receiver environment, the biology and the safety use record of the organism.
II) Problem formulation. - It must be done a list of hypothetic hazards.
III) Risk Characterization.- For a risk to be characterized as a danger it must be possible, measurable and testable.
IV) Risk estimation. - It measures algebraically the risk magnitude through the probably/effects binomial of happening. Once we have the scientifically measured the risks, mitigation alternatives are proposed.

Developed by the Protocol Secretariat, it is the preferred method of risk assessment; but due to its complexity, it was decided to look for other evaluation tools.
An alternative to the one proposed by the Cartagena Protocol, developed by 14 Latin-American experts in the area of genetic, biotechnology, agronomy, biology, among others. The Latin America ERA guide simplifies the steps for a risk assessment, making it more didactic and applicable to the Latin-American reality. Although it been more simple, it still follows international biosafety standards. so guarantee the safety of the people involved in the Project. Besides, it tries to promote the research and innovation in biological sciences and knowledge spreading in our countries in ways of development.
