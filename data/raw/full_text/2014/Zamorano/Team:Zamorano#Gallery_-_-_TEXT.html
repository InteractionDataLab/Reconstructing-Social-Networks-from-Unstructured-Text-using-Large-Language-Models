Creation of the E. zamofordi bacterium photos
On June 2013, we had the honor of counting with the presence of Dr. Paul Jaschke, an important molecular biologist of Stanford. With his aid, we could develop a copper biosensor based on a E. Coli bacterium, transformed by genetic engineering. This bacterium is able to detect copper pollution in contaminated water (possibly because of pesticides overuse or mining leakages.
Activities at Alison Bixby Stone School
Let’s take a look of the workshop iGEM Zamorano team prepared for the future scientists on synthetic biology. This took place on May 2014; the activity consisted in learning the basis of genetics and extraction of DNA using strawberries. This is a first step towards enlighten the younger generations and preparing them for a future full of scientific innovations and opportunities. Join us into this beautiful experience.
Zamorano’s Panamerican Fair Photos
In the Zamorano Panamerican Fair, which was helded on September 6th, our team developed an activity to show the people the extraction of DNA as a simple activity of synthetic biology. People were fascinated about how a little lab practice could obtain a big component of human beings. We also explain them how synthetic biology could become an important tool for giving solutions to the problems that are facing the world.
Presentation to Board of trustees photos
On June 2014, we presented our project to Zamorano’s board of trustees in order to introduce the members of our group to them. We explained to them the importance of our participation in the iGEM competition. They understood the relevance of involving Zamorano University in this kind of activities and gave us their complete support to keep on working on the project. this opened an important door to biosciences in our university.
Presentation to the Biotechnology and Biosafety National Comitee
On September 2014, our team included the “risk assessment” as an important part of our project.  In order to emphasize it, we presented it to the Honduras biosafety committee to get its support. The members of the committee appreciated our activities, gave us advises and recommendations.
