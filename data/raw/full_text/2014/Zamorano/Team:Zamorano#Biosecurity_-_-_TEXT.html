Biosafety
What is biosafety?
Good Security Practices (GSP) were taken out of a publication made by the Worldwide Health Organization (WHO) titled “Biosecurity manual in the lab” in 2005, and adapted it to the practice performed. This guaranteed the safety of the staff members that worked in the modification and testing of the bacterium. It is important to mention that the organism does not represent a biologic risk because of it been non-pathogenic. None the less, for the development of this project it was necessary to operate under a biosafety level 2 with the intention of learning how to apply better GSPs. In order to achieve this objective, the practice was based in 4 fundamental axes of biosafety:
Restricted access for people not authorized
Personal protection equipment team manages the instruments in the lab.
Biocontention mechanisms.
Final disposal methods.
Why is biosafety so important?
The use of biological agents is nothing new. History gives us many examples even before microbiology science was developed. Recently, there were innovative and perverted strategies meant to cause panic. Examples include the dissemination of anthrax spores (Bacillus anthracis) in 2001.
Bioterrorism and its effect
Bioterrorism is defined as criminal actions using biological agents such as pathogenic microorganisms, toxins or lethal substances in order to spread diseases, cause panic situations and, in some cases, death.
Considering possible attacks and a worldwide terrorist crusade, international organizations, address extraordinary financial resources and military logistics in order to create new defense protocols and to promote legislation against this menace in member countries. In order to be in the position to give an effective and timely wise response to the threat of biological weapons, governments have the duty to safeguard their populations.
What have other done to address this issue?
Organizations such as the UN, WHO and FAO, among others, have written international regulations in order to take care of transportation, management and adequate use of infectious substances. Also, national governments have adopted safety measures and written internal regulations in order to protect its populations.
How should Synthetic Biology be introduced in Latin American countries?
Activities related to synthetic biology must be implemented progressively, step by step, in such a manner that risks are evaluated in terms of protection to human and environmental health, and once these have been assessed, it is possible to go to the next level with reasonable security. In addition, any issues must be addressed in an individual fashion, case by case. In addition, there are new kinds of conflicts, and its evaluation should be done with the same criteria applied to ethical and legal analysis of other emerging biotechnologies and not away from them.
