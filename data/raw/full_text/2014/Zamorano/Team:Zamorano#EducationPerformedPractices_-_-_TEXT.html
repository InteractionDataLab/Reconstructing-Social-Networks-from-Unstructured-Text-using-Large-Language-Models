Education practices with elementary students
Performing laboratory practices with children familiarizes them with topics about synthetic biology from an early age. Children who become familiar with these issues at an early age increases the odds of them accepting this science when they grow up. For this, we have prepared small activities depending on the degree of schooling that arise. Children from last grade of elementary school were chosen, for the ease of interaction with them and because children around that age are more open to learn new lessons.
Activities performed
Games: We used various games where their knowledge was put into practice. As resources for these activities, cardboard platforms, puzzles and dice were designed. Important issues, such as the composition of DNA, processes transcription, translation and DNA replication, and amino acid composition of proteins were taught in the simple way.
Laboratories: In the laboratory practices for children, we have implemented and developed easy to perform protocols. The team imparted several workshops for children aged 10 to 12 years. In addition, small laboratory practices are hoped to be developed, based on synthetic biology and related sciences, for elementary school teachers to implement in their institutions. One example of such practices is the extraction of DNA from a fruit.
General public
Educational practices in the education section are not only limited to professionals or students; they also focus on an open and more diverse audience. Basic ways in which you can convey the development of synthetic biology, advances, applications and databases in public events were designed. This will keep informed a wider audience.
Team exposition in fairs, festivals and special events: The team attended the tenth Panamerican Fair organized by Zamorano, which attracts the attention of Honduran, Salvadoran and Nicaraguan population. Thanks to this year´s popularity of the fair, we reached over the 15,000 people who attended the event and actively participated in lectures, small laboratory practices and small conversations with team members and advisors. It is expected for us, the Zamorano team, to participate in cultural events and exhibitions, where we may be reach a wider audience.
Enterview with social media: Along with the communication and marketing department of our institution, we have organized various ways to transmit information through several information channels; so that we can transmit the advances of the team.
Social networks: By having the opportunity to be on social networks, team progress, activities undertaken, progress of synthetic biology, relevant scientific research, applications and other information related to synthetic biology is transmitted.
