Results
Through the survey and its analysis, we found that there is a significant difference between the two population of interest, Zamorano and the other universities in Honduras. To understand the public perception about biotechnology and synthetic biology we proposed five different sections, with specific aspects to assess in each one. The survey was based on the Likert scale, giving values from 1 to 5 to the answers of the questions, were:
Strongly disagree
Disagree
Undecided
Agree
Strongly agree
Some of the questions about awareness of a certain topic only needed two possible values being.
1.
Yes
0.
Otherwise
Basic knowledge about food production
Knowledge and level of approval of hybrid plants and animals
Level of approval of GMO’s and general knowledge about biotechnology
GMO considerations
Synthetic Biology considerations and awareness
Basic knowledge about food production
The first section was about basic knowledge about food production, where there was a 99% statistical difference between Zamorano and other universities in four of the five stated questions. The knowledge about food production is higher in Zamorano, as well, the knowledge of hybrid methods to create plants and animals improved varieties. This fact can be explained through the area of study in Zamorano that is mainly focused in agricultural sciences. As well, when the populations were asked about their knowledge of use of pesticides in the food that they consumed, Zamorano’s population were less exigent with the use of pesticides and organic food production, however, there is a higher frequency of people who have seen organic labeled food in Zamorano’s population. There is no significant difference in the awareness of both populations about chemical treatments in food.

Knowledge and level of approval of hybrid plants and animals
To be more specific, the survey contained five questions to understand the knowledge about hybrid plants and animals. It has found that there is a 99% significance difference between each population in the five stated questions. It is evident that Zamorano’s students tend to answer that they know more about the techniques. For example, Zamorano population agree that they have eaten before food that has been grown using biotechnology techniques to create hybrid varieties, as well in the questions about the approval of the use of crossbreeding to grow plants for food and if it is morally correct to do that. This pattern repeats when they answer about the use of crossbreeding for animals.

Level of approval of GMO’s and general knowledge about biotechnology
Here we were able see that both populations don´t show a significant difference between their basic knowledge about science and technology since both of them agree that they have good bases. On the other hand, most Zamorano students replied that their basic knowledge about biotechnology was very good meaning that they had received classes about the topic or read scientific journal articles. Students from other universities replied that they had received little information about the topic meaning that most of it was from conversations, TV or newspaper or magazine articles. What’s interesting is that students from other universities mostly think that genetically modifying either a plant or animal is morally incorrect while Zamorano students only think that genetically modify plants is, but don’t think that it is or not morally incorrect to genetically modify animals. Finally we were able to see that the students from other universities mostly think that if a genetically modified organism could reproduce by itself it could mean a danger for the environment while Zamorano students neither agree nor disagree with this possibility.

GMO considerations
Both groups tend to agree that genetically modified plants are better than the not modified, but that food produced with these plants should not be labeled as “organic”. Other university students tend to agree that genetically modified organisms represent a potential risk for human health and environment while Zamorano students disagree with this notion. Zamorano students tend to think that genetically modified food should not be sold at “natural products” stores while students from other universities neither agree nor disagree with the idea. Furthermore, Zamorano students also tend to think that unjustified fears and risks have been exaggerated in the general population while students from other universities don’t show this tendency in their responses. Both groups agree that GMOs have to be strictly regulated by national governments and international organizations.

Synthetic Biology considerations and awareness
The results of the survey did not show significant statistical difference between students of Zamorano and from other universities about the use of synthetic biology to solve specific problems, both groups agree on the use of this technology. Furthermore, both groups think that the genetic modification of organisms could be a future source of jobs and income for the general population and that the Honduran scientists involved in such research have a good knowledge of synthetic biology and its repercussions, so that only moderate regulations on genetic engineering research would probably be necessary.
Finally with a statistical significant difference of 95% confidence, the survey has showed differences between the two groups about their knowledge of synthetic biology and its potential to improve quality of life. Zamorano students have received enough information about synthetic biology (from newspaper articles, magazines, radio and TV programs) and, as a result, are of the opinion that it will improve the quality of life; whereas students from other universities have received only little information concerning synthetic biology and as a result have no opinion about its potential to increase the population quality of life.

Due to the influence and education received related to agricultural areas, Zamorano students tend to have a deeper knowledge about the use of biotechnology to create hybrid plants and animals for food production, also, they are less demanding about restrictions to the use of pesticides in food production and the consumption of organic food. We concluded than although there is a significant statistical difference between groups, students from Zamorano and other universities in Honduras are aware that biotechnology research needs efficient regulation policies.   On the other hand, their level of knowledge about Synthetic Biology and GMO’s is clearly deficient: thus, the need and importance of providing the general population with the required impartial and legitimate information that would allow them to make up their own opinions on these subjects.
