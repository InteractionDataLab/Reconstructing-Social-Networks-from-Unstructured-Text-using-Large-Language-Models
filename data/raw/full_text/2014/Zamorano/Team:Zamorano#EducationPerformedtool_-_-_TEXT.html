Risk analysis tool
Zamosupport has been developed by the Zamorano Team in order to serve as support for future iGEM teams. The idea emerged as a response of the need that we had during the development, It was quite difficult to obtain support in our risk assessment development. As a team, we don’t want to limit our participation to the competence; we want to offer our aid for future opportunities.
The tool is currently limited to web personal assistance and Skype meeting. However, in the future, we aim to create a phone application for all students who want to perform a risk assessment on a modified organism. The app phone will be free for all users with an .edu termination e-mail. What we like to improve, and our objective for the future, is to generate a software able to answer common questions about biotechnology and synthetic biology. It would be an useful tool for the development of education in synthetic biology.
