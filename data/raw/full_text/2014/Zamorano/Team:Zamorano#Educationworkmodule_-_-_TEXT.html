Learning by doing work module
The “learning by doing” system has characterized Zamorano University in its 71 years of existence. It states that people learn better about something, if they do it themselves; hence the name. The unique philosophy of Zamorano provides the students with a learning process full of abilities and skills based on scientific, theoretical and practical knowledge; students are motivated to integrate what they have learned to solve professional modern real life problems in different kind of environments.
The Zamorano Latinoamerica iGEM team, proposed the creation of a learning by doing work module for third year students. It is an advanced biotechnology module with emphasis on environmental science.  The proposition got  accepted. This work module will bring students the opportunity to develop projects that may address this century´s challenges, using biologic technology based solutions. The module will be two weeks long, and there will be a time of 3 months between the two weeks. The first week will be instructed introduction lectures, and then students will be assigned takes that students may comply in a three months period. After the three months the student will return to the module to perform laboratory practices.
Objectives:
To promote among students the assertive communication, critical thinking and teamwork.
To teach the students about the basic principles of biological sensors.
To promote in the students aseptic technique skills.
To teach the students about the basic principles of synthetic biology.
