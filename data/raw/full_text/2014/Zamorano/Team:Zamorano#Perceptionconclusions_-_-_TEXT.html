Conclusions
Due to the influence and education received related to agricultural areas, Zamorano students tend to have a deeper knowledge about the use of biotechnology to create hybrid plants and animals for food production, also, they are less demanding about restrictions to the use of pesticides in food production and the consumption of organic food.
We concluded than although there is a significant statistical difference between groups, students from Zamorano and other universities in Honduras are aware that biotechnology research needs efficient regulation policies.
On the other hand, their level of knowledge about Synthetic Biology and GMO’s is clearly deficient: thus, the need and importance of providing the general population with the required impartial and legitimate information that would allow them to make up their own opinions on these subjects.
