We enjoy the process of the game to explore new ideas and solve problems by ourselves, and we gradually become independent and cooperative. This summer, we have made great efforts to improve our project, to carry out various human practices. Therefore, we hope ideas of our project will be applied successfully in real life in future. </P></DIV><H4>Students</H4><UL><LI><STRONG>Wenxuan Chen (Bobby)</STRONG><P><SPAN>

In this team, I am one of the team leaders being responsible for making arrangements and promoting internal unity. As a team member, my job is to design wet lab works and to analyze the results. Autonomy is what the competition attracts me most, which encourage us to think and tackle problems independently with fun and knowledge acquired. I believe that science is not only a way to the truth, but also a process to improve life of humanity. So I enjoy the game and I love the iGEM team.</SPAN>

I’m a sophomore in College of Life Sciences. What attracts me most is human immunology and I really want to acquire more knowledge from different sources. Taking part in iGEM is a great chance for me to broaden my horizon and learn more from relevant researchers as well as to improve my scientific English. I work on the safety part at the beginning but the most dramatic part for me is the physical device of MDC. I’m not good at physics therefore there are many sleepless nights readingliterature. Anyway, the interesting part comes when I can do experiments for our team and set up the wiki. Drawing is my hobby and a way to relax myself. The process of learning about wiki design is happy and to be enjoyed. Additionally, I designed and sketched the shirts for our team. The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today. Now I’m ready to come here to share great ideas with counterparts and fulfill our dream.

My contribution in our team is that I knocked out the gene called arcA in the wild type E.coli MG1655. Thanks to iGEM, I really enjoy the process of this competition. From the beginning of brainstorming to the end of the experimental results, we realized the process from scratch. In this process, through synthetic biology science, there are always new things to produce, but also a lot of problems. I enjoyed the process of having problems, when everyone can get together and discuss solutions to the problem, that is wonderful!

In the past few months, I have joined in the iGEM team. My contribution to the team mainly combines from two parts. The first part, during the brainstorm period, I was in MFC group first and brought up the idea of mixing up MFC with desalination. Later, after the re-grouping, I turned to the idea of logic gates and completed its project primary design. And the second part comes later when our team finish the experiment part and acquire a series of data, I will be responsible for data processing and if it is needed, biological modeling.I join in iGEM because I long for an experience in which I can participate in every step of a science project, very rare chance in university. And until now, I have found myself make progress in paper reading, idea searching and project planning which I hope I can carry on. Compared to many other team members, I am a lot worse than them in biology knowledge and lab technique, but I am fascinated and good at computer things in which I have and will try my best to help the team.

I am one of the youngest members of the team, so there are more difficulties for me than other older members. Even so, I still try my best to solve every problem, and during this process, I acquire many knowledge of synthetic biology and my ability of reading paper and researching project are improved. By cooperated with teammates , we finished many researches, like TNT degredation by bacterium, Bio-insecticide, DNA vaccine and MDC . Though the first three projects are all failed, I really enjoy the process of researching project and the time when I stay with my teammates. Most importantly, I enjoy the competition.

Staring from PCR to finishing up by constructing a functioning vector I have came up with many problems. Until now I start to know experiments written on books are not as simple as it looks. IGEM has provided me with a chance of working with so many brilliant teammates. They have taught me a lot not just skills but also ways of solving the problems.

At present, I am learning related experimental technique in the State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources.In our iGEM team, I participated in experiment design, I found some genes in research articles which can improve MFC’s performance. When our project need a promoter which regulate by sugar concentration to increase our bacteria’s survival rate, I guess one or more promoters of genes in carbohydrate metabolism will match this requirement, I hope we can find what we need that. What’s more, I participated in the construction of the recombinant plasmid vector. I think that the standardized plasmid vector of iGEM make our experiment easier.

Fortunately,I join our team to be a member representing our school. Our team came out the idea about MDC after many times of brainstorm. I took charge the part of oprf which can enhance engineering bacteria’s ability which transport electron to cathode. With the teammates, I designed the experimental scheme how to copy the gene and how to consture vector. It is impossible to finish this part alone,thanks to my teammates and the generous helping from professor Chen. Finally, I hope our team can complete the project as our expectation.
