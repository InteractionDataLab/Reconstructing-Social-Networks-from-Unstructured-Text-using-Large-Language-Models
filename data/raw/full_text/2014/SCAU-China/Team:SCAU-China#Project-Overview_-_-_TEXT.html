Project
Overview
In view of rapid depletion of traditional energy resources and increasing demand of desalination of seawater for fresh water, we aimed to enhance the electrogenic capacity of microbial fuel cells (MFC) by genetically modified bacteria and optimize the traditional microbial desalination cells (MDC) device. We knocked out the arcA gene and over-expressed the nadE gene in E. coli. These modifications released the inhibition of metabolic enzymes in anaerobic condition of ArcA protein, also boosted up intracellular NAD+(H) level for higher electron transferring rate, by which the electrogenic capacity of the MFC was collectively enhanced resulting in a high efficient seawater desalination in MDC system.
MFC= more fresh water and clean energy
