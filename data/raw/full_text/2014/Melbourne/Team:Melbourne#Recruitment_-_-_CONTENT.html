2015-16 Melbourne University iGEM Team! </BIG><BIG>Please
read the information below to find out what iGEM is all about. We are
currently looking for members of the leadership team, and after the
completion of Semester 1 exams, there will be a general recruitment

is an undergraduate science
competition held each September in Boston. In the period leading up to
iGEM,
university teams use the latest tools from synthetic
biology to
create a novel single celled organism or “biological machine”. They can
also develop synthetic biology computing and lab tools, engage in
scientific outreach, and even develop biotech businesses.</SPAN></BIG><BIG><SPAN data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}" class="userContent"><SPAN class="text_exposed_show">Each year, students from around
the globe form
teams at their respective universities with the goal of building a
biological system or tool, which they later present at the iGEM global
conference. Students in the past have designed bacteria that
produce new types of drugs and biofuels, act as biosensors of toxic
pollutants, and serve as biological computation
platforms  (for more examples of past

in the iGEM
teams have complete control over the teams’
project and scope. There are many possible projects and types of teams.
There are 15 tracks in the iGEM competition. They include 8 standard
tracks and several special tracks
(e.g. entrepreneurship, software, social policy, etc.). Two examples of
possible iGEM teams would include:</BIG><BIG>1. Standard tracks: In the standard tracks, teams
develop iGEM
projects for research purposes and to advance science on a foundational
or applied level. Last year, the Melbourne iGEM
team competed in the Manufacturing track, working on a project to
develop bacteria capable of producing new types of antibiotics.
However, there is enormous variety in the types of problems teams can
work on (see <A href="https://igem.org/Results?year=2013&amp;region=Championship&amp;division=igem">past
team Wiki's</A> for examples).</BIG><BIG>
2. Special tracks: the iGEM competition has expanded
significantly since its inception, with the addition of several new
tracks to capture the enormous growth of synthetic biology.
For example, teams can now compete in an entrepreneurship track where
they produce not only a scientific advancement, but also a business
plan to
commercialise the work. The track is aimed at giving students
a conducive and educational environment to start a synthetic biology
company, and is inspired by the recent boom in the synthetic biology
startups
(e.g. see <A href="http://eu.indie.bio/">Indie Bio</A>).</BIG><P><BIG><BIG><BIG><BIG><SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Timeline</SPAN></BIG></BIG></BIG></BIG></P><BIG>The next
iGEM team will run from Semester 2, 2015 to Semester 2, 2016. In
Semester 2, 2015, the team
will be organised, the project selected, and the lab set up. During
this period, team members will need to work to ensure that the
foundations are in place to start significant lab/project work during
the summer. A large portion of the practical work will then take
place during the summer of 2015-16. Therefore, to participate in the
team you will need to be available during the upcoming summer. Finally,
additional work will be carried out as needed during the lead up to the
2016 iGEM conference (the iGEM Giant Jamboree) in September of next
year.</BIG> <P class="MsoNormal"><BIG><BIG><BIG><BIG><SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">What is involved and what is
needed?</SPAN></BIG></BIG></BIG></BIG></P><BIG>We are searching for
enthusiastic
students with
an interest in biotechnology and science.<O:P> </O:P></BIG><BIG>As
part of the iGEM team, you would help with the
following tasks:</BIG><UL><LI><BIG>Research on the iGEM project ideas. The ideas
for the iGEM project are student driven, and team members often need to
answer specific research question to design new experiments or come up
with new ideas. This will typically involve doing  searches of
the literature using Google Scholar or other tools and reading
scientific articles.</BIG></LI><LI><BIG>Help with developing experimental methods. The
2014 team has built up a library of protocols and experimental methods.
However, the project for 2015 will likely require new methods. You will
need to look up protocols in the literature and adapt them to the
project requirements.</BIG></LI><LI><BIG>Wet lab work, modelling/computation or
engineering design. By joining the iGEM team, you will have an
opportunity to participate in the lab and learn many standard
techniques in molecular biology. Alternatively, many iGEM teams make
use of the skills of engineers, computer scientists, and other
non-biological science disciplines.  For example, this may
take the form of modeling a biological system using software like
Matlab, designing a microfluidic device with biological applications or
designing an electrical device which interfaces with a biological
system. If you have an interest in interdisciplinary research between
your field and biology, it is likely iGEM will be able to accommodate
it.</BIG></LI><LI><BIG>The scope of iGEM also extends into
non-traditional science areas, including biotechnology
entrepreneurship, biotechnology ethics and the law, and science
outreach, and so students with business, law, design, and arts
backgrounds are also welcome to participate. You could, for example,
create a business plan for a iGEM-created company, examine bioethics
within synthetic biology, or design educational/outreach program for
high schoolers.</BIG></LI></UL><P class="MsoNormal"><BIG><BIG><BIG><BIG><SPAN style="font-weight: bold;">Recruitment</SPAN></BIG></BIG></BIG></BIG></P><BIG>We are currently seeking
