Safety
Safety  Level Rating System
Australia uses a four-part ‘Safety  Level’ rating system for laboratories in which Level 4 is used for the most  dangerous organisms. Our laboratory is Level 2 (moderate risk).
 
Work  Environments Used to Handle Biological Materials
Open benches and a laminar flow  hood/biosafety cabinet with open front are used when handling biological  materials in our laboratory.
Some materials are handled in  different work environments, for example DNA gels containing EtBr are only used  in designated areas and some procedures involving bacteria that need to be  sterile are performed near an open flame, while most other procedures are  performed at open benches.
 
Personal  Protective Equipment
In our laboratory lab coats, gloves  and safety glasses/goggles are worn at all times and full face shields are worn  when using the UV light box. Latex gloves are used for most procedures in the  lab, however, nitrile gloves are worn when handling EtBr.
 
Disposal  of Biological Waste
Biological waste (e.g. pipette tips)  are disposed of in a yellow biohazard which is sealed when not in use. When  full, this biohazard bin is sent to be autoclaved before it is disposed with  appropriately along with the biological waste from the other laboratories in  the institute.
Biological waste such as liquid cell  cultures has bleach added to it and sits overnight in the fume cabinet before  the liquid is poured down a special biological waste drain and the container is  autoclaved.
 
Safety  Training
The Melbourne iGEM team received  safety training provided by The Bio21 Institute. The topics covered in this  training included: details of emergency actions, the university OH&S policy  and issue resolution procedures, the university's environment policy and  procedures, procedures for reporting incidents/near misses, hazards and unsafe  acts/work processes, introduction to Bio21 EHS staff, location of relevant EHS  documentation, security, 'out of normal hours' access, equipment operating  procedures, general safety.
The laboratory safety requirements of  the institution can be found here: https://intranet.mdhs.unimelb.edu.au/ohse-training-requirements .
 
Local  Rules and Regulations
Christian Rantzau (Bio21 Health & Safety Representative) is responsible for biological safety at our institution.  We briefly discussed the program with him and no concerns were raised, nor  changes made to the project. He ensured that we were appropriately trained in the  safety protocols and procedures of the institution.
The biosafety guidelines of The Bio21  Institute can be found at: http://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/bio-21-institute-intranet/environmental-health-and-safety/safety .

Risks  of Our Project Now
Risk to the Safety and Health of Team  Members/People Working in the Lab
E. coli has a low, but not  non-existent virulence. For this reason, we wear gloves and lab coats and wash  our hands when entering and leaving the labs. When analysing DNA agarose gels  both the EtBr solution and the UV light box pose a risk to the health of our team  members. In these specific cases we wear nitrile gloves when handling the gel  and a face shield when operating the light box.
Risk to the Safety and Health of the  General Public
E. coli has a low, but not  non-existent virulence. For this reason, we wear gloves and lab coats and wash  our hands when entering and leaving the labs. This helps to reduce the risk to  the safety and health of the general public.
Risk to the Environment
When disposing of things such as  liquid cell culture, we sit them overnight in the fume cabinet with some bleach  in the,. In the morning we then pour the liquid down the shoot in the fume  cabinet and autoclave the containers. We do not pour hazardous chemicals down  the sink. All of these action minimise the risks to the environment.
Risks to Security Through Malicious  Mis-Use
Our project does not pose much of a  risk in terms of malicious mis-use by others, but to try and prevent this we  have key card access into both the building and the labs so that they cannot be  accessed by the general public.
Measures Taken to Reduce Risks
We employ safe lab practices (i.e.  wearing gloves and lab coats), dispose of waste appropriately, use a baceterium  (E. coli) with a very low virulence,  and have key card access to the labs.
 
Risks  of Our Project in the Future
If our project is successful it will  allow people to use the molecules we make as a platform technology for making  disulphide bonded peptides. These peptides could potentially be used for  harmful purposes. We don’t currently have any design features to reduce the  risk of someone using our project for harmful purposes. In the future if it  were deemed necessary we could potentially try to limit the types of amino  residues or groups that could be added to the arms of our peptide by native  chemical ligation.
