About The University of Melbourne
Located in Melbourne, Victoria, The University of Melbourne was founded in 1853 and is Australia’s second oldest university. The university is consistently ranked among the leading universities in the world, with international rankings of world universities placing it at number 1 in Australia and number 34 in the world (Times Higher Education World University Ranking 2013-2014).
About The 2014 Melbourne iGEM Team
The 2014 Melbourne iGEM team consists of 19 highly-motivated undergraduate students and 1 postgraduate student from a range of disciplines, including biochemistry and molecular biology, chemistry, chemical engineering and bioengineering. The team’s academic and research credentials are well-tested. This year, the team comprises three of The University of Melbourne’s Chancellor’s Scholars (top 0.1% of all Australian high school students) and several team members with research experience at Melbourne’s high-profile research institutes, such as the prestigious Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, and The Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute. The team is supervised by Associate Professor Heung-Chin Cheng, Associate Professor Paul Gooley, Associate Professor Neil O’Brien-Simpson, and Dr. Angus Johnston. The Melbourne iGEM team was founded by a group of enthusiastic and motivated students in 2013. The 2013 team played a key role in establishing the foundations of this year’s team and generating this year’s project. Unfortunately many of the 2013 team members could not continue their work for iGEM in 2014, so credit must also be given to Pedro Avellar Costa, Michelle Tie, Georgina Panshem, Morgana Cerqueira, Jeong Yoon Esther Kim, Winnie Tan, Hannah Nguyen, Mary Teo, Cathy Pitt and Joyce Kant.
Faculty Supervisors
Heung-Chin  Cheng (primary supervisor)
An Associate Professor with  the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Heung-Chin has been  studying the biochemical basis of the regulation of protein kinases and  phosphatases since he was a graduate student at the University of California in  1982. His PhD project unravelled the active site structure of c-AMP-dependent  protein kinase, how the kinase recognises its protein substrates and how the  kinase is selectively inhibited by its endogenous inhibitor.  Heung-Chin was the Melbourne iGEM team’s  supervisor and he kindly offered us space to work in his lab and assisted us  when we had questions about practical procedures, troubleshooting or theory.
Paul Gooley
Associate Professor Paul Gooley directs a structural biology research group that focuses on the application of NMR spectroscopy to elucidate structure and protein interactions. He obtained his degrees at The University of New South Wales and spent 10 years in the USA, including 5 years at the pharmaceutical company Merk and Co. Over the last 10 years his group has conducted and published NMR structural and dynamical analyses on a number of protein domains and systems that have biological functions in stress and infection, in lipid transport, in protein and membrane trafficking, and in receptor signalling. Paul assisted the 2014 Melbourne iGEM team by providing advice, answering questions and brainstorming.
Angus Johnston
Dr Angus Johnston is a researcher at the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Science. Angus is an ARC Future Fellow who’s work focuses on developing better ways to deliver drugs, making them more therapeutically active and limiting side effects. He has extensive knowledge and expertise in nanomaterials assembly, material characterisation, cellular interactions and advanced imaging techniques. Angus’ research interests include targeted vaccine therapy, sensors for cellular imaging, understanding cellular processing of nanoparticles, self assembling peptides as drug carrier and the toxicology of nanomaterials. Angus assisted the 2014 Melbourne iGEM team by providing advice, answering questions and brainstorming.
Neil O’Brien-Simpson
Associate Professor Neil O’Brien-Simpson is a researcher at the Royal Dental Hospital in Melbourne and has an interdisciplinary background, combining organic and peptide chemistry with immunology to develop novel vaccines and therapeutics and investigating the immune response to pathogens. His research into vaccine design and periodontitis has resulted in Neil being awarded the Colgate Prize for Dental Research (1999), The IADR Hatton Award (2000) and the Oral Biology Award (2003). In 2004 he became program co-leader for the Novel Diagnostics, Vaccines and Pharmaceuticals Research Program in the Oral Health CRC. Neil assisted the 2014 Melbourne iGEM team by providing advice, answering questions and brainstorming.
