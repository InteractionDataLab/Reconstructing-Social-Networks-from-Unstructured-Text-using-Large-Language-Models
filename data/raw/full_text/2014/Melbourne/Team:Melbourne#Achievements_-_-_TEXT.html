Bronze medal requirements
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
We have met this criterion
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2014 Judging form.
We have met this criterion
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We have met this criterion
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We meet this criterion
The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
This is documented on the Attributions Page .
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry
Submitted   BBa_K1394000 , BBa_K1394001 , and BBa_K1394002 , the parts central to our project.
Silver medal requirements
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
As described on our project page , we validated that our protein expression BioBricks worked and led to protein expression (e.g. BBa_K1394001 ).
Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry.
These characterization efforts have been documented.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines)
These parts have been submitted.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.
We asked the general question "how can we improve access to science education across a broad age range, including early childhood education?" With this effort came additional questions, including "How can we make biology more accessible to young children?" and (for high school aged students) "How can we improve access to science education for disadvantaged youth in Australia?" We consulted with a variety of stakeholders within the science education community in order to answer these questions, as described in our Human Practices page.
Our project concept could potentially have commercial value and therefore we had to address intellectual property issues. We consulted with a number of experts and stakeholders in the intellectual property space, as described in our Human Practices page.
Gold medal requirements
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part.
Our BioBrick protein expression device improves the 2013 TU Delft SUMO fusion BioBrick . This discussed in detail on our project page .
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Our team formed a collaborative relationship with the University of Oxford. We assisted Oxford by providing them with a design concept for attaching enzymes to star peptides, discussing how we could improve their enzymatic system with star peptides, and providing research on linking their particular enzymes to a peptide linker. See our project page for details.
Our team helped significantly with the promotion of the University of Sydney's outreach program, the Strange Nature writing competition. We created a promotional video for the competition which was distributed to high school teachers and students across Australia. Further, we contacted high school teachers directly to help distribute video and word of the competition. See our Human Practices page.
