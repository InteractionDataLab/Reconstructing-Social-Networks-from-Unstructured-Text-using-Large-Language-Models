ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We want to thank every undergraduate student who has contributed in this project, as well as to our graduate students, advisors, instructors and every one who has given our valuable suggestions that lead us to where we are today!
Fundraising help and advice
We would like to thank the various sponsors for their support of our project and research. Without their support in our research endeavors none of this would be possible. We would like to personally thank President Jere W. Morehead for assistance via the President’s Venture Fund. We are grateful for the University of Georgia’s continued support of the sciences on campus. We would also like to show our appreciation for Dr. Hoover from the Department of Microbiology, Dr. Verma from the Department of Engineering, Dr. David Lee from the Office of the Vice President for Research, Dr. Moore from the Department of Genetics, Dr. Glover from the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Candee Bradbury from the Student Allocations Fee, Nancy Perkins for her help in the Department of Microbiology and The UGA Alumni Association. We appreciate your contributions and help!
