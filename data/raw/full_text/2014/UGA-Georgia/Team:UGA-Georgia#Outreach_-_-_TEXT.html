Inspire:
Local Outreach Projects
Provoking interest in the sciences to local students is an important aspect of UGA iGEM. We have visited East Athens Community Center, Middle Georgia Regional Library, and Clarke Middle School to engage the students in fun, hands-on experiments ranging from plating bioluminescent bacteria, to swabbing & plating objects in the classroom, to literally anything dry-ice related.
Educate:
Teaching Funding Biology and How Scientists May Safely Design New Pathways or Modify Existing Ones
UGA iGEM has taught classes at Clarke Middle School on the role of bacteria and how they impact our daily lives.
Inform:
Raising Awareness of Synthetic Biology
In addition to participating in the seemingly countless number of synthetic biology surveys circulated by other iGEM teams this year, UGA iGEM has begun assisting Duluth High School in creating their own iGEM team so they may participate in the high school division.
To raise awareness of synthetic biology in the professional community, UGA iGEM presented its project at a number of Seminars this year with the intention of networking with other leaders in related fields with diverse backgrounds outside of academia.
