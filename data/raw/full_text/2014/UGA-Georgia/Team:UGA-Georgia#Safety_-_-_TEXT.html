Laboratory Safety
For our research, we utilize two different organisms in respective labs. We use Methanococcus maripaludis in the microbiology lab and Escherichia coli in a biochemical engineering lab.
In our microbiology lab, our own safety is not all that is considered, we must also consider our organism's safety. Since Methanococcus maripaludis is an obligate anaerobe, we must use an anaerobic chamber when working with it to ensure its survival.
