The Undergraduates
Peyton Smith is a senior dual majoring in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Genetics. Otherwise known as ‘the Methanococcus guy’, Peyton has led the team as President and ran the Methanococcus lab for the past two iGEM seasons. He claims his favorite part about working in the lab is teaching the new iGEMers, but we really know he just enjoys torturing them with synthetic biology/Methanococcus trivia. His passion lies in developing new biological systems and his dream is to pursue a doctorate in bio-engineering. Outside of science, he enjoys running and good old fashioned SEC football.
Rebecca Buchanan is a senior who is dual majoring in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Cellular Biology with a minor in Religion. She has been a part of the UGA iGEM team since January and has become very invested in the team and research. Rebecca wants to apply to graduate school for regenerative medicine which she finds absolutely fascinating. When she isn't working in the lab, she enjoys playing tennis, going to concerts, and spending quality time with her cat .
My name is Mengyin Cheng, I am a senior majoring in Biochemical Engineering and I have been a member of the iGEM team for almost a year now. I have always loved metabolic engineering and the science behind it. The way genes can be manipulated to create the products that we desire is the part that I love the most about metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. This is what has brought me to join the group. Moreover, the product that we have produced has the ability to benefit several aspects of people’s life including the cosmetic and the oil industry. I have always wanted to give back to the society with the knowledge that I have acquired in college. In addition, I have several other interests such as dancing, singing, and drawing.
Kevin Moriles is a 4th year senior at the University of Georgia, majoring in Biological Science. After graduation, Kevin plans on applying to medical school to become a pediatrician. Kevin joined iGEM in 2013 and has been deeply involved ever since! When he is not studying or working on research, Kevin can be found reading or working out. Go DAWGS!!!!
Katelyn Snider is a 4th year Biology major from Roswell, GA. In addition to research, she also enjoys the outdoors and volunteer work. After graduation, Katelyn plans to pursue graduate school.
Brandon Burroway is a 4th year undergraduate student at UGA. He is majoring in Biology and minoring in Spanish. He is currently applying to medical school for entrance in Fall 2015. Brandon worked with the iGEM team throughout the Summer of 2013 and Spring 2014. Outside of research and class work, Brandon enjoys volunteering at the the Mercy Health Center and playing soccer at the University of Georgia.
The Instructors
Rachit Jain is a Doctoral Candidate at the University of Georgia pursuing Metabolic engineering research. He is also the founding member of UGA's iGEM team. Currently he is playing the role of an instructor for UGA's team.
Naga Sirisha is a graduate student pursing her PhD in Biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Georgia. Her involvement with biotechnology research began with her masters’ research on downstream processing for the purification of bacterial hyaluronic acid produced by the fermentation of genetically engineered lactococcus lactis at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (India). Currently, her doctoral research interests are in the area of algal biofuels. She is working towards improving the yield and quality of algal biofuels produced by thermochemical and fermentation pathways using various pretreatments and component extraction methods.  Besides research, Sirisha pursues hobbies such as music, tennis, yoga and hiking.
Narendran Sekar got his master degree in Biotechnology in 2012 from Centre for Biotechnology, Anna University, Chennai, India. In his master program, he worked on flux balance analysis to optimize the production of recombinant protein in E. coli. He is currently a PhD student in Biological and Agricultural Engineering at the University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA and doing his research in highly interdisciplinary field of bio-electrochemistry.  His major research work focusses on studying electrogenic characteristics of microorganisms such as cyanobacteria (Synechococcus elongatus) and hyperthermophilic archaea (Pyrococcus furiosus), and genetically manipulating their extracellular electron transfer capabilities for energy generation applications. He is instructing undergraduate students at UGA for the iGEM competition for the past two years.
Dr. Zhe Lyu. Postdoctoral research associate.  I have been working on methanogenic archaea encompassing their isolation, genomics, physiology and ecology since my doctoral studies.  I am currently involved in engineering Methanococcus maripaludis, an excellent model organism for methanogenic archaea to promote biogas production. Methanogenic archaea play vital roles in regulating our climate and quenching our thirst for clean energy, all because the one simple molecule they release – methane.  I believe that our research activities at UGA will enable better engineering and understanding of methanogenic archaea using synthetic biology, and prepare us for the grand challenges such as global warming and energy crisis.
