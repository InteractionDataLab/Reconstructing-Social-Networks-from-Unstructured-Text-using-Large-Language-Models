Bioenergy Systems Research Institute (BSRI) Annual Retreat
The Bioenergy Systems Research Institute encourages and facilitates: (a) integrative, collaborative basic and applied research projects in bioenergy that recognize the entire lifecycle and environmental impact of biomass production, harvesting, transport, treatment, conversion, and recycling; (b) education andtraining of the next generation of scientists and engineers that will form the 21st century workforce in the alternative energy field; (c) outreach and communication activities to involve our public and private stakeholders in the development and dissemination of next-generation bioenergy technologies.
UGA iGEM attended and presented at the BSRI Annual Retreat on May 2, 2014. Here we were able to network with other bioenergy researchers within the University of Georgia and explain our project – use of synthetic biology for production of energetically valuable biochemicals from the methanogenic Archaeon, Methanococcus maripaludis. UGA iGEM was awarded best undergraduate presentation at this conference, pictured below.
9th Annual Georgia Environmental Conference
The UGA iGEM team was selected as an undergraduate finalist to present at the 9th Annual Georgia Environmental Conference described below:
The Annual Georgia Environmental Conference (August 20-22, 2014 | Jekyll Island) is the largest and most comprehensive environmental conference aimed at providing cutting edge information to more than 500 state environmental leaders. They represent state, local, and federal government, business and industry, attorneys, consultants, engineers, developers, land owners, architects, agribusiness, energy experts, water planning districts, academia, public health, solid waste and recycling, and environmental nonprofits. The Student Scholarship Poster Competition is intended to provide students the opportunity to present their research on timely environmental issues to this wide range of experts.
UGA iGEM attended and presented at this 3 day conference where we were able to network with many environmental leaders in the state. We were able to share our project, particularly how Methanococcus maripaludis and synthetic biology can lead to greener solutions primarily through energy sustainability. We were awarded the Georgia Environmental Scholarship award for best undergraduate project, pictured below.
