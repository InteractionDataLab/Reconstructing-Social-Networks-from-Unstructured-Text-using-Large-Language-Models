Relieve the pressure from all the bottles/tubes.
Remove the caps and seals from the bottles/tubes.
Spin down the cultures to form "loose" cell pellets.
When you have formed your cell pellet, immediately discard the supernatant.
Re-suspend the cell pellets in 1.0mL of McM Media.
Transfer the re-suspended cells into 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes.
Close the cap.
Place the microcentrifuge tubes into a shaker at 37C for ~20hrs.
Remove from the shaker and take to a plate reader to run fluorescence tests.
Components for McM Media
dH2O - 50mL
General Salts solution - 50mL
K2HPO4, 14g/L - 1mL
NaCl, 293g/L - 7.5mL
Separatory Funnel Extraction of Extracellular Content
Take the ODs of all the cultures to be extracted.
These cultures should ideally be in the 0.5-0.9 range.
Open the cultures using a de-clamp under the fume hood, relieving the culture of any pressure.
Transfer the culture to a centrifuge ready container
Centrifuge the cultures at 11,100G for 20 minutes, or until cell pellet is formed.
After removing the samples from the centrifuge, carefully pour the supernatant into a separatory funnel, being sure to preserve all of the cell pellet. Place the cell pellet and its container into a -20C freezer for 1 hour, if planning on completing the extraction for cellular content.
Pour 5ml of 9:1 hexane/acetone solution into the separatory funnel, there should be a distinct difference between the water phase layer and the organic phase layer.
Carefully, yet thoroughly, mix the water phase and organic phase by inverting the separatory funnel, letting any built pressure escape by briefly removing the top to the separatory funnel after each inversion. Avoid letting any bubbles form by aggressive inversion.
Allow the water phase and organic phase to settle until a distinct difference is visible again.
Drain the supernatant into a container, leaving only the organic phase in the separatory funnel. This supernatant may be discarded.
Drain all of the organic phase into a beaker and add 1.5g of sodium sulfate. Swirl this mixture around thoroughly until most of the powder has formed into small clumps.
Gently pour the filtered organic phase into a new container without including any of the sodium sulfate. Use a micropipette to transfer any remaining organic phase to the new container, if necessary.
Allow the filtered organic phase to dry under a stream of N2 gas until it reaches <1.5ml, then transfer to a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. Allow to continue drying under a stream of N2 gas until it reaches 0.1ml, then transfer to a GC/MS sample bottle.
Separatory Funnel Extraction of Intracellular Content
Allow cell pellets to remain in -20C freezer for at least one hour, so cells may properly lyse.
Resuspend cell pellet in 5ml 9:1 hexane/acetone solution. Use a micropipette to thoroughly mix cell pellet into hexane/acetone solution. Swirl this solution thoroughly for proper mixing.
Pour this solution into a beaker and add 1.5g sodium sulfate. Swirl this mixture around thoroughly until most of the powder has formed into clumps.
Gently pour the filtered organic phase into a new container without including any of the sodium sulfate. Use a micropipette to transfer any remaining organic phase to the new container, if necessary.
Allow the filtered organic phase to dry under a stream of N2 gas until it reaches <1.5ml, then transfer to a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. Allow to continue drying under a stream of N2 gas until it reaches 0.1ml, then transfer to a GC/MS sample bottle.
Extraction of Organically Soluble Material from Methanococcus – Balch Tube/Sonication
Take & record optical density (OD) values of cultures to be extracted. These cultures should ideally be in the 0.5-0.9 range.
Open the cultures using a de-clamp under the fume hood, relieving the culture of any pressure with a needle, if necessary.
Transfer the culture to a centrifuge-ready container.
Centrifuge the cultures at 11,100G for 20 minutes, or until cell pellet is formed.
After removing the samples from the centrifuge, carefully pour the supernatant into a balch tube, being sure to preserve all of the cell pellet.
Prepare the cell pellet and complete sonication to lyse cells, if planning on completing the extraction for cellular content.
[Either combine the supernatant & cell lysate, or extract them separately.]
Measure out & pour 12-15ml of Methylene Dichloride (DCM) into the balch tube with the extract, there should be a distinct difference between the water phase layer and the organic phase layer. [DCM will be the bottom layer as DCM is denser than water.]
Cap the balch tube, and mix the water phase and organic phase by rapidly vortexing for 60 seconds. Allow any built pressure to escape by briefly removing the cap during mixing.
Allow the water phase and organic phase to settle until a distinct difference is visible again.
Using a micropipette, carefully remove and discard the water phase, leaving only the organic phase in the balch tube.
Pour all of the organic phase into a beaker and add 1.5g of sodium sulfate. Swirl this mixture around thoroughly until most of the powder has formed into small clumps.
Gently pour the filtered organic phase into a new container without including any of the sodium sulfate. Use a micropipette to transfer any remaining organic phase to the new container, if necessary.
Allow the filtered organic phase to dry under a stream of N2 gas until it reaches <1.5ml, then transfer to a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. Allow to continue drying under a stream of N2 gas until it reaches 0.1ml, then transfer to a GC/MS sample vial.

Record OD again from the final step in Day 2, inoculate 0.5ml to 5ml of selective broth
Plate Reader
We used the Gen5 Software.
We created a procedure to read both in the spectrum of mCherry and within the auto-flourescence spectrum.
Allow the machine to warm up.
Run a blank plate.
Fill the individual wells of your choosing (96 total) with a maximum of 100uL.
Check all wells that you want to be read in the program.
Run the trail.
