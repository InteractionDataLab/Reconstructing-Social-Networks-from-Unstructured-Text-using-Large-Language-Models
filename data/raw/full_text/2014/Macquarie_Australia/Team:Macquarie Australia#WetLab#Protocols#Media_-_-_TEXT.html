Media & Plates
Well prepared media are crucial to successful selection and growth of organisms.
LB AGAR PLATE PREPARATION
Add 15g Bacto agar to 1000mL of LB media and autoclave (121oC for 15mins).
Add 1000uL of Chloroamphenicol (25mg/mL), Ampicillin (50mg/mL) or Kanamycin (30mg/mL) and mix well before plating out and setting the agar.
Figure 1. Preparation of LB agar plates.
LB MEDIA
Ingredients: Tryptone 10g, Yeast extract 5g, NaCl 10g, Milli-Q water to 1000mL.
Methods: Dissolved 10g tryptone, 5g yeast extract and 10g NaCl in 800mL Milli-Q water, making use of a magnetic stirrer. Once dissolved, bring volume up to 1 L using Milli-Q water. Autoclave 1L of the solution (121oC, 15 min, standard liquid cycle).
SOC MEDIA (FOR COMPETENT CELLS)
Ingredients: 10g bacto-tryptone, 2.5g bacto-yeast, 1000µl 5M NaCl, 417µL 3M KCl, 1.205g 20mM Mg2SO4, 805g 20mM D-glucose & 500mL Milli-Q water.
Methods: The adjusted quantities were combined in a 1 L measuring column with constant stirring and then placed in the autoclave for sterilisation (121oC, 15 min, standard liquid cycle).
