Synthetic Biology in
Australian Law
Synthetic biology is a relatively new industry with a lot to offer - with applications ranging from the use of alternative biofuels, contribution to human health, detecting pathogens and the conversion of feedstock to chemicals.
The growth of this industry seems to be at threat as funding opportunities are narrow. In comparison to American and European researchers, the Australian field of Synthetic Biology receives significantly less money. A report released in 2010 reveals that United States received a sum total of roughly 430 million dollars in funding for Synthetic Biology research (Kuiken, 2010). European researchers in Netherlands, UK and Germany have received a sum total of $160 million in the same time period (Kuiken, 2010). In comparison, the Australian Synthetic Biology funding landscape is limited, particularly when when it comes to funding from the public sector. There appears to be no publicly funded Synthetic Biology research projects.
The grim state of funding for Synthetic Biology research also translates into minimal funding for iGEM teams. This is primarily because of the lack of visibility of Synthetic Biology research in Australia, coupled with a lack of confidence in the capability of undergraduate research. In our experience, private funding is also notoriously hard to get, primarily because most relevant organizations (biotechnology companies, lab equipment companies etc.) are usually based in North America or Europe and regional subsidiaries are unlikely to have the budget to fund teams in the Oceania region.
We are very grateful as we have been fortunate to have received external sponsorship for our project this year.
A huge thank you to our Gold sponsors!
Also many thanks to our Bronze sponsors!
How to put together a sponsorship package
From our experience, getting funding for an iGEM team in Australia is difficult to acquire and highly competitive. With only limited avenues available for sponsorship, you must think of the best possible way to demonstrate that your project is worth funding.
From our experience, one of the first things that users on So You Think You Can Synthesize asked was – How do you raise funds for your project? We recognized that this must be a common problem most iGEM teams face. The problem is perhaps particularly severe for Australian teams given that funding opportunities are narrow in the Oceania region.
Despite all these constraints, the Macquarie iGEM 2014 team’s fundraising efforts were immensely successful. We attribute this to our cleverly articulated sponsorship document which highlighted why our project was worth funding, and also what the sponsors will get in return for investing in our project. We wanted to make this sponsorship document publicly available, so all future iGEM teams can use this as a template, and hopefully this can help them with their fundraising initiatives. Please find the attached link to download a PDF version of our sponsorship document.
2014 iGEM Macquarie Sponsorship Support
The Macquarie iGEM team 2014 believes strongly in the important ethic of open sourcing in science, and we hope that having our documents publicly available will prove to be a massive advantage for other future iGEM teams, particularly Australian ones.
