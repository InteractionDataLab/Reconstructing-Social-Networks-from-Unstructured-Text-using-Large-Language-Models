SDS-PAGE
Re-suspend pelleted bacterial cells in 200µL of Milli-Q-water
Transfer 50 µL of suspension into new Eppendorf tubes and combine with 50ul of 2xTruSep sample buffer.
Shear the cells using a Hamilton syringe.
Centrifuge the preparation for 3minutes @ 13,000 rpm.
Load 20 µL of the supernatant into gel.
Conduct electrophoresis at a constant voltage (200V) for 1 hour.
Coommassie Stain for ~30 minutes.
