Money does not make the world go round, energy does.The ability to effectively generate, store and conveniently access energy is the hallmark of the developed world. These systems are integral to our everyday lives including: transport, heating, industrial production, control of water supply and recreation.
The Global Energy Crisis
Fossil fuels have been the staple of energy needs throughout the 20th century. Their consumption far exceeds the rate which they can be formed and this has led theorists to predict the catastrophic economic consequences of exhausting the non-recyclable resource, culminating in theories such as the famous 'peak oil' proposition [1]. While advances in technology for gas and oil exploration and extraction have resolved the scarcity of energy resources in the short-term [2]. Furthermore our capacity to withstand the release of carbon by-products remains a pertinent challenge to our generation.
Renewable resources utilise natural energy in a sustainable, long term manner. Methods of harvesting can be direct or indirect including converting light to electricity in solar cells or harnessing the power of the wind or the waves. These characteristically produce few harmful byproducts. One of humanity's first energy sources was also renewable: the usage of biofuels, organisms that harvested solar energy and stored them as energetic organic compounds. These were burnt, and in the present time, fermented, allowing a useful conversion of solar energy to that useful for human purposes.
Solar Energy Redux: Obtaining Usable Energy
Despite the higher efficiency of direct photovoltaic conversion of photons to electrical energy, biofuels remain a relevant option.  Concerns have been raised regarding the industrial processes and hazardous materials involved in the creation of photovoltaic systems, often requiring significant fossil fuel energy to produce [3, 4]. Biofuels are cheaper, requiring less capital and energy to produce. They are self-replicating and require uncomplicated maintenance. The drawbacks are in efficiency: high efficiency biofuels produce fuels capturing a peak of 6% of solar energy, whereas the thermodynamic limit of photovoltaics is around 14% [5].
The salient difference is how the energy is used; biofuels provide an efficient mechanism for storing energy, sealing it within energetic organic compounds such as ethanol or hydrogen gas, enabling relatively easy transportation and storage of energy in comparison to batteries, that are often heavy and lose energy over time. The place for biofuels in the 21st century is producing a convenient storage mechanism for energy, particularly for vehicles, where there is a need to carry fuel for long distances without opportunity to refuel on electrical power. Biofuel research and development in the 21st century has focused around high efficiency bioethanol production for these purposes [6].
Our Response
The Macquarie iGEM team aims to develop artificial photosynthesis in a biological system harvest the unlimited supply of solar energy. By engineering the biosynthetic pathway for chlorophyll-a, we are taking the first step towards developing the entire photosystem II in the hope of generating hydrogen gas. The industrial potential lies in the ability of channelling this hydrogen gas to develop a renewable energy source. The project aims to engineer the essential genes for the biosynthesis of chlorophyll a into E. coli.
It is hoped that by successfully engineering and demonstrating the capacity for this organism to express the relevant enzymes, and produce chlorophyll-a, that the hydrogen gas produced by the photosystem can be used to produce biofuel substrates. The success in the synthesis of chlorophyll in E. coli provides the groundwork for future teams to complete the synthesis of photosystem II. This provides a significant leap into the development of a hydrogen-generating system and a renewable biological energy source.
