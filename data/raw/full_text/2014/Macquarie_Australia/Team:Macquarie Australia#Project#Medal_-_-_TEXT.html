Medal Requirements
Additional requirements for a Bronze Medal
Registered the team and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
Successfully completed and submitted an iGEM 2014 Judging form.
Created and shared a description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Plan to present a poster and talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
The description of our project clearly attributes work done by the students and distinguishes it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. Attributions can be seen here .
We have documented several new standard BioBrick Parts used in our project and have submitted these parts to the iGEM Registry. These parts can be seen here .
Additional requirements for a Silver Medal
We experimentally validated new BioBrick Parts of our own design and construction worked as expected.
We documented the characterisation of those parts in the "Main Page" sections of those Parts/Devices Registry entries.
We submitted those new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Our project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. In addition to addressing safety issues, we provide a legal analysis as to the patentability of genes in Australia. All our Policy and Practice activities can be seen here
Additional requirements for a Gold Medal
We improved the function of existing BioBrick Parts , entered this information in the Registry, created a new registry page for the improved part, and submitted this part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We outlined and detailed an approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to our project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation through our So You Think You Can Synthesize human practice project.
