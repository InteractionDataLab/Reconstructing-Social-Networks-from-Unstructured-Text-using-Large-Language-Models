Induction of Operons
Re-transform restriction-digest screened plasmids according to the heat shock transformation protocol.
Screen plates for transformant colonies and place in 5mL of LB broth with appropriate antibiotic concentration at 37oC with shaking until OD600¬ is 2.0 – 3.0.
Take whole volume and place in 45mL of LB broth in a sterile conical flask containing appropriate antibiotic concentration. Incubate at 37oC with shaking until OD600 is 0.5-0.7.
Transfer 1M IPTG in a 1:1000 dilution into flask. Incubate at 15oC with shaking overnight.
Cell pellets were collected through centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 5 mins.
Cell pellets were resuspended in re-suspension buffer (Containing: 10% glycerol w/v, 50mM Tricene NaOH pH 8.0, 2mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT) and whole lysate was collected through a French Press for functional assays of operon protein products in lysate.
Operon 1 functional assay
Collect whole lysate from induced operon 1 containing ChlI1 & ChlD expressed proteins, and ChlI2 expressed protein only as a negative control. Prepare and map out 384-well microtitre plate for assay.
Prepare master mix of recombinant ChlH (500nM), GUN4 (500nM) & Protoporphyrin IX (1µM) to cover sufficient amount of expressed operon wells, and negative control wells to be assayed (25µl/well).
Prepare master mix of recombinant ChlD (500nM) and ChlI1 (500nM) to cover sufficient amount of positive control wells to be assayed (10µl/well).
Prepare assay buffer containing: MgCl2 (14mM), ATP (4mM), DDT (1mM), Trycine/NaOH (50mM; pH 8.0), 10% glycerol.
Operon assay wells: 10uL I1/D lysate // 15uL buffer // 25uL purified H/GUN4/PROTO master.
Positive Control assay wells:  10uL recombinant I1/D master // 15uL buffer // 25uL H/GUN4/PROTO master.
Negative Control assay wells: 2.5uL ChlI2 lysate // 10uL master // H/GUN4/PROTO master.
Place microtitre tray in Pherastar FS. Measure emission at 595nm with excitation 420nm, cycling every 30s for 1h.
Following emission measurement, measure fluorescence spectra from 550-660nm with 420nm excitation to identify Mg-Protoporphyrin IX formation (595nm) and Protoporphyin IX presence (635nm).
UHPLC protocol
The UHPLC protocol was performed according to Benton et. al. 2012. Briefly, methanol extracted compounds were separated on a reverse phase C18 column. Compounds were detected at an excitation wavelength of 404nm and emission wavelength of 618 nm.
