PCR
PCR Mixture: General recipe for PCR is as follows:
4 µL of 5x phusion buffer.
0.4 µL dNTPs.
0.6 µL of DMSO.
0.2 µL of polymerase.
11.8 µL of water.
To this mixture, add:
1 µL of forward primer.
1 µL of reverse primer.
1 µL of template.
Total volume = 20 µL
PCR settings: A general program for PCR is as follows:
Initial denaturation at 98oC for 30seconds.
Followed by 30 repeats of:
Denaturation – 98oC for 10seconds.
Annealing – 60oC for 10seconds.
Extension – 72oC for 2minutes.
Final extension – 72oC for 10minutes.
