Dr. Richard Kong
Dr. Richard Kong is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biology and Chemistry at the City University of Hong Kong. His research interest is on the application of DNA-based technologies to develop novel risk assessment and bioremediation tools to address problems related to diverse aspects of pollution in the marine environment. He has played a major role in coordinating the iGEM Team at CityU, and providing the necessary guidance, training and support to all the iGEMers.
Dr. David , Sung-Kay Chiu
Dr. Chiu is an Assistant Professor of the Department of Biomedical Sciences at City University of Hong Kong. He is interesting in teaching students especially on technical skills in biomedical research. His research focuses on the mechanism of the choice in cell fates in mammalian cells and the cellular functions of transcription factor AP-4 during development and in cancers.
Dr. Terrence , C. K. Lau
Dr. Lau is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at City University of Hong Kong.  His research focuses on the RNA biogenesis in infectious diseases, in particular those pathogens found in Hong Kong.  He enjoys talking and asking questions about science.  His role in iGEM team is to coordinate and provide support to the students.
Advisors
Wolf Cheung
Former Graduate Teaching Assistant
He has very broad research interest and occasionally jumps from one research area to an entirely unrelated one. His most recent switch is from environmental science to developmental biology. He spends most of his time in the lab(s) enjoying varieties of tea. He remains wathcing over the CityU iGEM team’s shoulder, in spite of his departure to a faraway land.

(BSc Hons)
I am currently a Graduate Teaching Assistant in the Dept of Biology and Chemistry at the City University of Hong Kong. This is the first time for CityU to participate in iGEM. iGEM participants can enrich their learning and discovery experience outside the classroom and appreciate how interesting and diverse science can be. Apart from providing technical support to the CityU iGEM team members, I have taken a special interest on the effectiveness of their learning progress. Whenever they encountered technical difficulties, I would help our with the technical details. Although synthetic biology is a new and challenging area of science, it is a worthwhile experience to explore the fascinating field of synthetic biology.

Oscar
I am a fresh graduate from City University of Hong Kong Applied Biology program. Currently as a research assistant in Dr Richard Kong’s lab. My duty is to ensure the iGEMers can get all the necessities for their experiments and to give technical support when they encounter difficulty. It is awesome to work with all the iGEMers and I really enjoy every minute with the team. I hope my limited experience in biology research can help the team and make things a little bit easier.

So Pui Yu
I am a fresh graduate and currently a Research Assistant from Department of Biology and Chemistry at the City University of Hong Kong. I have longed to participate iGEM for years. Though I could not take part in this amazing project as a student, instead, I cannot imagine that I could guide iGEM participants by providing technical supports. I hope all CityU iGEM Team members would take pride in the synthetic biology and gain the most in such a great event.

(BSc Hons)
As one of the teaching assistants at City University of Hong Kong, it is my great pleasure to provide technical support to the CityU iGEM team in providing assistance with quantitative real-time PCR analyses. We have encountered various problems as we do not have prior experience in the iGEM competition. I am grateful that I can use my knowledge and research experience to serve the CityU team members. Learning outside the classroom and developing the interest in science are much more important than anything else that our team members can obtain through iGEM. Although preparing for the iGEM is a challenging experience, it is truly worthwhile to support students in pursuing their interest and research experience in Synthetic Biology.

Vivian Lin
Natural history aficionado, freelance artist/writer, fresh graduate from the City University Applied Biology program and currently working as a research assistant. I help conduct the longitudinal study on the Discovery-enriched Curriculum currently being implemented in the university. I took part in proofreading and editing of the CityU iGEM Wiki.
