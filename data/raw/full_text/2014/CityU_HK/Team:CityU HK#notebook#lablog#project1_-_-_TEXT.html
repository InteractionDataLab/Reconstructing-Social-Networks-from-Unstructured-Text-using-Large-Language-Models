TesA module's lablog
JulyOpen or Close
Week 3 (13/7~19/7)
- Primer design for leaderless tesA for Fit-coli (‘tesA) & New biobrick (‘tesA BB)
Week 4 (20/7~26/7)
- PCR of ‘tesA and ‘tesA BB
- PCR purification of ‘tesA and ‘tesA BB
- Prepare LB agar plates(‘tesA BB)
Week 5 (27/7~31/7)
- Digestion of ‘tesA BB and pSB1C3 plasmid with EcoRI & PstI restriction enzymes
- PCR purification for digested ‘tesA BB
- Sub-cloning of ‘tesA BB into pSB1C3 plasmid
- Transformation of ‘tesA BB into W3110 E.coli
- Pick colonies of the transformed E. coli with ‘tesA BB
Early AugustOpen or Close
Week 1 (1/8~2/8)
- Cell lysis of picked E. coli with ‘tesA BB
- Colonies PCR of ‘tesA BB by using VF2 & VR primer
- Send the ‘tesA BB plasmid for sequencing
Week 2 (3/8~9/8)
- 2nd PCR of ‘tesA
∵ The first PCR product of ‘tesA was degraded over a long period of storage time
- PCR purification of ‘tesA PCR product
- 1st Digestion of ‘tesA by using XbaI & PstI restriction enzyme
-> After running gel, no fragment showed in pilot ( other plasmid with the Xbal & Pstl respectively) , could not determine whether the digestion was success or not
- 2nd digestion of ‘tesA by using XbaI & PstI restriction enzyme with adding one more control pilot that is only plasmid with no enzyme
-> Still no fragment presented in pilot, we wonder whether the pilot plasmid or the restriction enzyme had problem
- 3rd digestion of lac promoter in pSB1C3 plasmid & pbad promoter in pSB1C3 plasmid by using EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI & PstI restriction enzyme
-> All of the restriction enzyme worked normally, but the pbad promoter in pSB1C3 plasmid was degraded
- 4th digestion of ‘tesA by using XbaI & PstI restriction enzyme
- Sub-cloning of‘tesA into rbs in pSB1C3 plasmid (Part: BBa_B0030)
Late AugustOpen or Close
Week 3 (10/8~16/8)
- 1st Transformation of ‘tesA with rbs (BBa_B0030) into W3110 E.coli
- Pick colonies of the transformed E. coli with ‘tesA & rbs (BBa_B0030)
- Send the‘tesA with rbs (BBa_B0030) plasmid for sequencing
∵ The sequencing result showed the coding error of the rbs
-> Used BBa_B0034 rbs in pSB1C3 plasmid to replace BBa_B0030 rbs for 2nd cloning
Week 4 (17/8~23/8)
- 3rd PCR of tesA’
∵ The 2nd PCR product of ‘tesA was used up
- PCR purification of ‘tesA PCR product
- 5th digestion of ‘tesA by using XbaI and PstI restriction enzyme
- Sub-cloning of ‘tesA into rbs in pSB1A2 plasmid (Part: pSB1A2- BBa_B0034)
- Miniprep of pbad promoter (Part: pSB1C3-BBa_I13453)
- 2nd tramsformation of ‘tesA with rbs (BBa_B0034) into W3110 E.coli
- 1st digestion of pbad promoter (BBa_I13453) by using SpeI & PstI restriction enzyme
Week 5 (24/8~30/8)
- Pick colonies of the transformed E. coli with ‘tesA & rbs (BBa_B0034)
- Cell lysis of the picked E. coli with ‘tesA & rbs (BBa_B0034)
- Colonies PCR of ‘tesA & rbs (BBa_B0034) by using VF2 & VR primer
- Send the‘tesA with rbs (BBA-B0034) plasmid for sequencing
- Miniprep of ‘tesA with rbs (BBa_B0034)
- 1st digestion of ‘tesA with rbs (BBa_B0034) by using XbaI & PstI restriction enzyme
- Gel purification of digested ‘tesA with rbs (BBa_B0034)
- PCR purification of pbad promoter (BBa_I13453) digested in week 4
