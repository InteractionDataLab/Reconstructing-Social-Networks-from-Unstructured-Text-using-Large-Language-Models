TesA Module's Lablog
JulyOpen or Close
Week 3 (13/7~19/7)
- Primer design for the leaderless tesA gene for Fit-coli (‘tesA) & New biobrick (‘tesA BB)
Week 4 (20/7~26/7)
- PCR of the ‘tesA and ‘tesA BB DNA
- PCR purification of the ‘tesA and ‘tesA BB amplicons
- LB agar plates with antibiotics were prepared
Week 5 (27/7~31/7)
- Double digestion on the ‘tesA BB and pSB1C3 plasmids with EcoRI and PstI
- PCR purification on the restriction digested ‘tesA BB DNA fragment
- Sub-cloning of the ‘tesA BB fragment into pSB1C3 plasmid
- Transformation of the ‘tesA BB ligation mixture into E. coli W3110
- E. coli colonies were picked with ‘tesA BB gene
Early AugustOpen or Close
Week 1 (1/8~2/8)
- Lysis of E. coli colonies was done on the ‘tesA BB gene boiling them in hot water
- Colony PCR on the ‘tesA BB gene was performed using VF2 and VR primer pairs
- The ‘tesA BB recombinant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing
Week 2 (3/8~9/8)
- PCR purification was performed on the ‘tesA PCR product
- Double digestion were performed on the ‘tesA PCR product using XbaI and PstI
- Digestion of the lac promoter in pSB1C3 plasmid and the PBAD promoter in pSB1C3 plasmid using EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI and PstI restriction enzymes
- Sub-cloning of the ‘tesA gene downstream of the RBS in pSB1C3 plasmid (Part: BBa_B0030)
Late AugustOpen or Close
Week 3 (10/8~16/8)
- BBa_B0030 was transformed into the host E. coli W3110
- The identity of transformants of BBa_B0030 was confirmed by DNA sequencing
-> DNA sequencing showed errors in DNA sequence in the RBS so we used the RBS sequence of BBa_B0034 instead of BBa_B0030 RBS
Week 4 (17/8~23/8)
- ‘tesA PCR product was purified with PCR purification kit
- ‘tesA PCR amplicon was doubly digested with XbaI and PstI
- ‘tesA was subcloned downstream of the RBS site in pSB1A2 plasmid (Part: pSB1A2- BBa_B0034)
- PBAD promoter plasmid (Part: pSB1C3-BBa_I13453) was purified with plasmid DNA purification kit
- ‘tesA with RBS (BBa_B0034) was transformed into E.coli W3110
- PBAD promoter plasmid (BBa_I13453) was digested with SpeI and PstI
Week 5 (24/8~30/8)
- Colonies of E. coli transformed with ‘tesA & RBS (BBa_B0034) were picked for colony PCR using VF2 & VR primer pairs
- DNA sequence of the transformant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing
- Plasmid DNA of BBa_B0034 was purified
- BBa_B0034 plasmid DNA was digested with XbaI and PstI
- XbaI / PstI digested BBa_B0034 plasmid DNA was purified
- PBAD promoter (BBa_I13453) plasmid digested with SpeI and PstI was purified
