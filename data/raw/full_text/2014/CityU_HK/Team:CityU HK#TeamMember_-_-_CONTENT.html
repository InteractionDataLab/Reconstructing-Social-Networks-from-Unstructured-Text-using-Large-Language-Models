I’m Maria. I love to explore innovative stuff and to apply science concepts to improve human lives. This is the first time I get in touch with synthetic biology and I find it a very fascinating field to explore. In the iGEM project, I help my team to build the wiki and construct a gene cluster of fadD and fadL. I am also the presenter in our team. My life isn’t all about science, I’m passionate about music (blues, rock, rap…), website design, water sports (surfing!!!) and travel.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 team-member"><H4>Marco So<SPAN>Biologist &amp; presenter</SPAN></H4><SPAN class="click">bio</SPAN><DIV class="content"><P>I am a year 3 student majoring in Applied Biology.

This is our first year to participate in the iGEM competition. It was difficult at first yet fruitful in the end. iGEM competition not only broadened our biological knowledge, but also stimulated our innovative skills and creativity. Most importantly, it gathered 12 of us as one team that shared one goal – to explore, to learn and to improve. I believe this goal is not only limited to one team or one competition, but also serves as a life-long motto.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4 team-member"><H4>Paul Tse<SPAN>Biologist</SPAN></H4><SPAN class="click">bio</SPAN><DIV class="content"><P>Aloha everybody. My name is Paul and I am a sophomore majoring in Biology and minoring in Psychology. I am enthusiastic about singing and the philosophy behind Christianity. In addition, I like reading comics and watching animation to kill time. This is actually the first time I participate in a scientific research project. I am mainly responsible for the lab work to construct a gene cluster of desaturases in this iGEM project. Hopefully this short journey will shed light on how my life will be in the future.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 team-member"><H4>Cherlin Lee<SPAN>Biologist &amp; Poster Design</SPAN></H4><SPAN class="click">bio</SPAN><DIV class="content"><P>Hi, I am Cherlin, a year 3 student majoring in Applied Biology. When I was small, I dreamt to have a microscope in my home, because my parents told me that our surrounding was full of bacteria, but I wondered if that was true. If I got a microscope, I could prove whether my parents were telling the truth. That little Cherlin could never imagine that one day when she grows up, she can even genetically modify bacteria!!! That is a wonderful journey of scientific discovery!!!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 team-member"><H4>Ken Lau<SPAN>Bioengineer &amp; wiki builder</SPAN></H4><SPAN class="click">bio</SPAN><DIV class="content"><P>Hi, I am Ken and a year three student in Mechatronics. iGEM gives me a rare chance to learn about synthetic biology and how to conduct biological research. In contrast to an engineering project, calculation is not the most essential element in biology. The result could be completely different if we repeat the same experiment. No matter how many painstaking yet joyful hours I have spent with agarose gel or culture plates, I am still spellbound by the unpredictability of the laboratory. And of course, I had so much fun doing lab with my lovely team members.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4 team-member"><H4>Lyann Chu<SPAN>Bioengineer</SPAN></H4><SPAN class="click">bio</SPAN><DIV class="content"><P>I am a Bioengineering student. I am interested in developing new technology and tools for the sake of bio-research. iGEM gives me an opportunity to apply what I have learnt in these two years to solve current problems. Being an iGEMer, I am responsible for doing lab works. Although our journey has not been smooth, there is nothing we cannot overcome with teamwork and team spirit. Through this student-oriented competition, I learnt not only different scientific techniques but also management skills to enhance working efficiency. I am privileged to be a part of this competition which provides an opportunity for engineering students to experience the laboratory.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 team-member"><H4>Joanna Wu<SPAN>Biologist</SPAN></H4><SPAN class="click">bio</SPAN><DIV class="content"><P>Hello, everyone! I am Joanna, the only non-local member in our team. I come from Taiwan and this is my 3rd year at CityU. I major in Applied Biology. I love everything  related to biology, especially animals. I consider myself an optimistic and hard-working girl. The reason why I join iGEM is that I want to learn more about synthetic biology and to be familiar with laboratory work. Apart from that, I hope to gain precious memories and friendship through participating in the iGEM competition. My dream is to be an expert naturalist in animal behavior or a vet in the future.

Frankly speaking, iGEM has been one of the greatest events in my life. It is my first time to go overseas for an international competition and to have such a long-term cooperation with teammates. As a Bioengineering student, I wish to integrate my engineering concepts, like characterization, into our project. In terms of my own philosophy, I stress on true freedom without limitation (given that it is moral). I do think the so-called unrealistic ideas are the source of imagination and may be the start of a brand new future. Had no one ever thought of flying in the sky, there would be no airplane for us to travel around the world today. Scientific research, including our iGEM project, should also be perceived this way in my opinion.

I am majored in Applied Biology. I was first attracted by this competition when I knew that I will have the chance to design and construct a bacteria with certain functions. It's incredible. I think it's a valuable chance in my life and I don't think I will have such a chance in the future. That's why I am here! To me, being different is important. I don't think there is only one way for me to reach my goal. I will try something different and I won't give up until I have tried hard on it.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 team-member"><H4>Paul Chi<SPAN>Biologist &amp; Poster Design</SPAN></H4><SPAN class="click">bio</SPAN><DIV class="content"><P>Hello! I am Paul. I am an undergraduate majoring in applied biology. I like science especially biology and chemistry. Why? Because I think doing experiments is fun, no matter what the result is, or whether it is successful or not. The process is exciting because I can still repeat them in hundreds or even thousands of different conditions and wait for its success when I have the time. I joined iGEM so I can have more lab work to do and it is fun to work in the lab. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4 team-member"><H4>Anthony Lo<SPAN>Biologist</SPAN></H4><SPAN class="click">bio</SPAN><DIV class="content"><P>I am Anthony Lo. I am especially interested in microbiology and molecular biology. Participating in the iGEM competition lets me apply what I have learnt, explore more about molecular biology and related practical skills, as well as create a genetically engineered bacteria by designing a gene constructed for cloning and measuring. To me, “work hard, play hard” is always true, implying the importance of work-life balance. I am concentrated in our experiments and am serious in the lab, but I would not hesitate to spend the time on entertainment with my teammates. “Work hard” leads to efficiency, while “play hard” leads to relief and stronger friendship!</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><TITLE>Bootstrap 101 Template</TITLE><DIV id="footer" class="row"><DIV class="col-md-7"><H3>Sponsors</H3></DIV><DIV class="col-md-5"><H3>Stay connected!</H3><P>email: <A href="mailto:cityuhk.igem@gmail.com">cityuhk.igem@gmail.com</A></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV id="copyright" class="col-md-12"><P>Copyright © iGEM CityU HK 2014.
