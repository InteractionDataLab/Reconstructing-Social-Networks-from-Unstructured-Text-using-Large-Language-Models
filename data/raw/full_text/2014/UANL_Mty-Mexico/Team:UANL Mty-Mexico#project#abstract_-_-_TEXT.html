Abstract
The Reprogrammator Project
In order to be capable of controlling transformed bacteria and reprogram its function as many times as would be required, we designed a system consisting of a bacteriophage that infects just one species of bacteria and has on its genome the information to codify a TALEN/ZFN enzyme and a reporter gene. With this tools (TALEN/ZFN) we can target a specific sequence of the host's plasmids to degrade them. The bacteriophages will replace the plasmids, giving it a new function or characteristic that could be a totally new one.
