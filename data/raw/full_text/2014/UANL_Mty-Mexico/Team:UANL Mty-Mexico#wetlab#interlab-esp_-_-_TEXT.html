Results
Here there is a construction map of the circuit:
We had a lot of problems with the part "PCC1" because there were problems when it was synthesized. When we cut it it only cut in one size couldn't cut it as we expected but we used it in the ligation anyways because all the other parts cut very well except this one. The part "PUC-57" worked very well while cutting with the restriction enzymes and at the ligation. For the Friday 21th, 2013, we got colonies of both ligations. We think the "PCC1" is not a good ligation because it did not released the fragment. But we are going to characterize the part with the "PUC-57" the next week. We cannot be sured right now because it doesn't have a reporter.
We also uploaded to the Parts Registry the design of our new part. http://parts.igem.org/partsdb/edit_seq.cgi?part=BBa_K987000
Here is the composite part http://parts.igem.org/cgi/partsdb/part_info.cgi?part_id=28522
Conclusion:
The team focused strongly on the lab work to reach the goal of the project, which is the creation of a bacterium capable of producing a bio-insecticide that helps the potato crop against the plagues of worms. The idea include two central systems working together to produce the insecticide in the best conditions. The lab work focused on the creation of these two parts of the system and for that reason it was necessary the synthetize of two gens which were the Vip3ca3 and the Riboswitch, parts that weren’t found in the parts registry. The lab work started until these two parts were mailed to us from United States.
When the parts finally arrived, the work in the lab wasn’t capable of obtain the gen of the Vip3Ca3 in good conditions, only the PUC-57 was growing and its DNA was showed correctly on the gels. Even this we continue with the cuts and ligations to see if we can obtain any special results. After two weeks trying the ligations weren’t growing in the Petri Dishes, so the whole process continue on the last week.
The last morning, the Petri’s Dishes showed some colonies which should represent the cuts that were done one weeks before, which means the cuts may be succesful and deeper studies will be done to the sample to characterize if the ligations were actually done. The strongest evidence to support this affirmation is the color of the colonies which relate to the description of the gens.
Further applications
The project was thought to be done in a bacterium, but the further plan is to made a transgenic plant that do the same function that the bacteria, to develop its own bio-insecticide, and then to be used in the city crops so the plague can be fight and the potatoes are not affected. Also the idea of the gellan gums can be used in order to maintain a suitable environment for the bacteria. These ideas may be applied or tested in a deeper way in a further work.
