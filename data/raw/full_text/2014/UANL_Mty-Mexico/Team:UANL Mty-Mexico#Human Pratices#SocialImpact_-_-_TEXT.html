The Project that we are developing is closely related with the transgenics in society, because of this we decided to make this magazine, becaus many people have no defined concept of transgenics. In this work we are trying to make a explain in a simple way what the transgenics are, trying to  tell the people that the transgenics are not only about food explaining the diferents áreas in which they can be used,  disprove the generalize ideas about transgenics and give  the idea  of safety measurements that exist for this organisms. This is with the objective of make an informed opinión on the people who read this magazine.
Here is the magazine that was made:
