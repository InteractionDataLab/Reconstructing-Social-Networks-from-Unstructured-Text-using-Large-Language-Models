Coaching
Thanks to the great closeness between the HighSchool team CIDEB and the Colleague team UANL, our team made some coaching about security protocols they should take with their project, as well as the use of laboratory techniques and methods of use.
Our main contribution was focused on the revision of their Wiki and Presentation. We acted as judges in their presentation and wiki, giving them feedback and exposing our points of views so that they could improve their projects conclusions and drafts before the date of their jamboree.
We are very proud of this activity not only because they did a great job, but also because they were the first HighSchool team from our university to get experimental results and getting the award for the Best New BioBrick Part or Device, Engineered.
Thank you for visiting our wiki. Follow us in:
