Protocols
General Rules:
1. - Always use your lab coat
2. - Always pick up the used material
3. - Never take any material to your mouth while you’re working with reactants
4. - Keep your working area clean
5. - All non-reusable material must be placed in the correct trash can
6. - Check for oppen gas and water valves, depending on your work
7. - Wash your hands before and after every session
8. - Always wear gloves when working with Ethidium bromide
9. - Every question, accident, etc. tell the instructor
Recommendations for Microbiology
10. - Sterilize with heat any crop material before and after using it.
11. - Don’t talk while you are working with sterilized material
12. - When you start and finish, sterilize the surface with 70% alcohol
13. - Al testing tubes, must be vertical
14. - Never deposit a living cultivation in the sink
15. - Sterilize every used material
Laboratory Protocol
Handling of lyophilized DNA’s plates.
This step is for searching and obtaining the desired piece.
Procedure:
1.- Search for the BioBrick in the Parts Registry
2.- Drill the plate, and add 10ul of mQ water
3.- Mix very well, and take the resusupended DNA to an Eppendorf tube
Preparation for competent cells and their transformation
This is to prepare the plasmid in the bacterium with the thermal shock
Transformation Procedure:
1.- Take 100ul of the bacteria to an Eppendorf tube
2.- Add 2ul of DNA and mix them
3.- Let in ice from 20 to 30 minutes
4.- Dive the Eppendorfs with 42°C water for 1 minute
5.- Take it to ice for 2 minutes
6.- Add LB and incubate them for 20 min, then put them into petri dish at 37°C all the night.
Inoculation in Petri Dish and Test Tube
Inoculate bacteria in dishes with agar and medium tubes with their antibiotics
Procedure:
For planting
1.- Take the colonies in a test tube with LB and the antibiotic
2.- Take the handle sterilized and spread the colonies in a Petri dish.
3.- Incubate for 37°C FOR 16 hours
Reseeding
1.- Add the antibiotic to a test tube previously half filled with Lb medium
2.- With a handle take a colony
3.- Then agitate the handle in the Tube, finally incubate at 37°C
Plasmid DNA miniprep
This is to obtain the DNA plasmid of a colony
Procedure:
1.- Add 1.5ml of colonies to an Eppendorf, centrifuge 30 seconds and throw the liquid  in the trash with soap.
2.- Add  200ul of solution I, II and III in times of 5 minutes respectively and then centrifuge the new solution.
3.- Pass the liquid to and Eppendorf containing 1ml of alcohol at 100%
4.- Incubate at -20°C for 10 minutes
5.- Centrifuge and throw the liquid.
6.- Add 200ul of Ethanol 70% and mix very well
7.- Centrifuge again and throw the liquid
8.- Let the precipitate incubate at 37°C, then add 200ul of mQ water with RNase and mix it
9.- Check in the gel or save it at 4°C
DNA quantification by UV spectrophotometer
This is for quantify the plasmid DNA extracted
Procedure:
1.- Take 1ml of mQ water in an Eppendorf
2.- Add 1ul of plasmid DNA
3.- Prepare the spectrophotometer
4.- Pass the DNA to the spectrophotometer
5.- Select the option (DNA or RNA)
6.- Write the lecture of the spectro at 260, 280 and 320, relation 260/280 and the concentration.
Plasmid DNA characterization
This is for identify the piece we have
Procedure:
1.- Prepare the mix
2.- Deal the mix in equal parts
3.- Add the DNA and mix
4.- Incubate the reactions at 37°C for 1 hour
5.- Use the gel for check the result
BioBrick parts assembly
Procedure:
In this step we are going to cut the plasmid with the appropriate restriction enzymes for deliver the desired fragment and to paste into another bacterium.
1.- Prepare the mix
2.- Lead the mix in equal parts and the add DNA, mix it.
3.- Incubate the reactions for 1 hour
4.- Check in the gel
5.- Save it for its ligation
Ligation of genetic parts
This step is for paste the desired piece in the bacterium we are going to use.
Procedure:
1.- Take in count the concentration of each one of the DNA’s.
2.- Use the calculator for obtain the amounts for preparing the ligation mix at 20ul
3.- Prepare the mix in the next order: mQ water, Buffer, and the plasmid
4.- Lead the mix and add the appropriate ligase
5.- Incubate the reactions at 25°C
