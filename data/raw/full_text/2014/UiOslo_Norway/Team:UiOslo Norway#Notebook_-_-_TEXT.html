Part B: LacZ-alpha Non Stop
Tuesday
William, Håkon
The results of the 3A assembly was poor, with either no growth at all or carpet growth.
The O/N cultures from the day before was made without using antibiotics, so the cultures was transferred to fresh medium with antibiotics to try to select for the right bacteria.
2I, 11N, 2K and 19E was plated on LB agar with 0.1% arabinose.
New batch of LB agar was made, using LB broth powder.
Vilde
No growth observed from the assembly into pSB1C3. We think there may be something wrong with the linearized plasmid. We will try to amplify the plasmid by PCR from another part and use that one in the assembly work.
Vilde
Found out that the iGEM scar contains a Stop codon
Found tRNA amber Stop – part in the kit
Found a constitutive promoter
Found plasmid (from jack) with another origin of replication
Izadora
An analytical gel electrophoresis was performed in a 0.7% agarose gel with samples from last PCR and O/N ligated products from A3 assembly. The fragment-sizes in the gel were like expected just for BAD -11N and HisTag 1 - LacZ-alpha Stop.
The gel electrophoresis was repeated with increased volume of sample (20μL) and all fragments presented the expected size.

50mL of SOC medium was prepared with: 10mM of MgSO4 and 2% of Glucose. The volume was completed to 50mL with LB medium and the final medium was sterilized with syringe filter (0,2μm).
The SOC medium was tested for contamination in test tubes by O/N incubation at 37°C and 180rpm.
The strain NCM17 without LacZ gene has arrived and was plated out in agar-kanamycin (Adgene®, working concentration = 50μg/mL) and test tubes without antibiotics by O/N incubation at 37°C and 180rpm (in the case of test tube only).
Week 29
Monday
William
Freeze stock was made of NCM17 strain.
Vilde
Tested the function of the pfu Turbo enzyme. The enzyme was forgotten at RT for 48h. I therefore tested if it was still functional by running a pcr on genomic DNA with Actin primers. I used the pfuTurbo protocol 600410. Results: No bands. The PCR was repeated with different primers and substrate but still showed no results. We concluded with that the enzyme is not functional anymore.
Izadora
One colony of NCM17 strain was picked up and incubated in a test tube by O/N incubation following the same protocol. The plate was stored at 4°C.
There were no colonies from transformation of 11.07, but for part 17O.
For sample 17O, O/N culture with chloramphenicol (Adgene®, working concentration = 25μl/mL) was prepared as before.
Tuesday
William
O/N culture of bacteria transformed with 17O was miniprepped.
Vilde
Cleanup-day in the lab! We tested all the minipreps we got in the freezer. Used Takara enzyme and general reaction mix. Tested them all on PCR and run a gel afterwords. We found out that all our plasmids contain the gene we expected.
Izadora
The gel electrophoresis was performed in agarose gel (o.7%) with digested and ligated parts.
The fragment-sizes were like as expected just for ladder and LacZ-alpha and -beta Non Stop digested products, but not for pSB1A3 and pSB1C3.
A PCR test was performed in all miniprep that we have so far using TaKaRa® enzyme and following its protocol with VF/VR2 program.
Using the Promega Wizard Plus SV miniprep kit, a miniprep was performed in O/N cultures with part 17O, storing it at -20°C. Frozen stocks of cells were prepared for O/N cultures with 60% Glycerol (1/1) and stored at -80°C.
Wednesday
William
Made 20 LB plates with kanamycin.
The miniprep of LacZ beta NS in pSB1C3 was run on a gel. The bond was the right size.
Vilde, Izadora
A3 assembly of constitutive promoter and amber stop tRNA. Followed protocol from iGEM kit. With some small changes – used only ¼ of the reaction volume.
Part A: Constitutive promoter
Part B: amber stop tRNA.
Linearized plasmid: pSBA1A3
Since the RNA made from the amber stop tRNA gene will not be translated into proteins, a RBS in front of the gene is not necessary. I therefore  ligated the promoter directly to the gene.
Digestion buffer: NEB 3.1
ligation time: 1h at RT.
Transformed 3 ul of the ligated product.
Elina

Vilde
New Assembly of amber stop tRNA and the constitutive promoter. Tried the assembly again, but this time with a larger reaction volume, 1/2 of the original volume. Also used the cutsmart buffer and not the NEB 3.1 buffer. I also changed and used the pSB1K3 plasmid instead of the pSB1A3 plasmid.
Vilde
Received primers for autotransporters and signaling peptide. Made stock solution and user stocks (5uM) of the primers.
Izadora
A PCR on 4 different colonies from transformation with pSB1K3 was done with TaKaRa® enzyme, following its protocol.

Vilde, Sumaya
We found out that the promoters we have been using do not contain a RBS in front of it. We will therefore need to make new constructs with a RBS in between the promoter and the gene. I found and transformed these RBS from the kit:
RBS 4G kit plate 4 in psb1C3
RBS 1N Kit plate 4 in pSB1A3
RBS-LacZ alpha 22D kit plate 3 in pSB1C3

The eppendorf tubes and pipette tips were autoclaved in dry program for 30min at 120°C.
Plates with agar-tetracycline (Working concentration = 10μg/mL) were prepared.
Tuesday
Vilde
Made O/N cultures from the 3A assembly done yesterday.
Izadora
Just few colonies were got from transformations, so the positive colonies were incubated O/N as previously.
LB-tetracycline, SOC and LB-ampicilin medium were prepared as previously.
Ligation with previous digested products was repeated as before and the transformation as well.
Wednesday
Vilde
No growth in the O/N culture except from the promoter-Amberstop-tRNA in the pAC-plasmid. We found out that we had used the work tetracycline antibiotic.
Vilde
PCR of lacZ beta from the galactosidase biobrick from iGEM kit. This galactosidase gene does not contain the EcoRI restriction enzyme in the end of the gene. This means we do not have to do mutagenesis to take away the restriction site. I use Q5 protocol and setup. Used primers: LaczBeta forward and LacZBeta reverse – Stop and Non-Stop. Used both galatosidace biobricks found in the kit as template. For the part 9E kit plate 2 (galactosidase w. RBS) I got clear bond for both parts. We will use these parts for future work.
Sumaya
Miniprepped pBad-RBS and promotor -amber tRNA O/Ns.
Digested the pBad-RBS and pSB1T3 and ligated thus:
pBad-RBS + 11N-T1
pBad-RBS + 19E-T1
pBad-RBS + 2K-T1
pBad-RBS + 2I-T1
Izadora
Colonies were got just for pBAD - RBS in pSB1A3.
A PCR in these colonies was performed following TaKaRa® enzyme’s protocol (VF/VR2 program).
The plates were prepared with anhydrotetracycline by mistake. For that reason plates and stock solution with tetracycline hydrochloride (15μg/mL) were prepared.
The previous transformation was repeated in the new tetracycline medium.
Thursday
Vilde
Made O/N culture of RBS-4G in pSB1C3. We will use this to isolate the plasmid, cut it and run it on a gel. We will isolate the plasmid from the gel and use it in the assembly.
Vilde

Vilde
Run gel on Sumayas PCR from yesterday. No Gel results.
Vilde
Bought T4 ligase.
Sumaya
Only the transformation of  pBad-RBS-11N-T1 and  pBad-RBS-2I-T1. O/Ns were made of these two.
Made 6 agar plates with L-arabinose and tetracycline. And replated the  pBad-RBS-11N-T1 and and  pBad-RBS-2I-T1 onto two of these to see if they would show colour the day after.
Sumaya
No colour reaction was observed from yesterdays tranformation on the platesa with L-arabinose. Since the colour reaction did not happen the O/Ns were not used and the plates discarded.
Izadora
A Miniprep from RBS 4G was performed using NucleoSpin® plasmid kit and following the manufacturer’s protocol (Macherey-Nagel).
Saturday
Izadora
The DNA concentration was measured by NanoDrop (NanoDrop 1000 3.8.1) in the following samples:
InvFull long: 40.9ng/μL
Ehaj 1: 45.9ng/μL
LacZ-beta Stop: 41.0ng/μL
LacZ-beta Stop: 37.6ng/μL
Signal peptide: 65.2ng/μL
RBS - pSB1C3: 32.3ng/μL
An A3 assembly was done using RBS - pSB1C3, but after digestion the digested products were tested in a gel electrophoresis with agarose gel (0.7%).
No fragments were seen, but the ladder.
In an attempt to correct subsequent failures of A3 assembly, the iGEM’s protocol was changed and 500ng of DNA was used, instead of 250ng suggested. For that reason, the digestion was performed at 37°C for 1hour.
In addition to that, the transformation efficiency kit from iGEM was used following the protocol to check the efficiency of the competent cells being used.
Week 32

Tuesday
William
O/N cultures of TOP10 and NCM17 was diluted and Jack’s protocol was followed in order to make them competent.
Vilde
Made O/N cultures of colonies from yesterday’s 3A assembly. I got colonies on assembly: 1,4,5,6,7,9 and 13.
Vilde
3A assembly. Due to few colonies from yesterday’s assembly, I suspect something wrong with the parts we already got. I will thus make some of them again from scratch by 3A assembly. Followed iGEM’s protocol and procedure. I ligated them all in to the pSB1K3 plasmid from the kit.
Part A: C-term his, Part B: Terminator1 (T1)
A. C-term his, B. Double Terminator (DT)

A Miniprep was performed using Promega Wizard Plus SV miniprep kit in the O/N cultures below:
CtermHisTag - T1
LacZ-beta pSB1C3
pBAD - RBS
CtermHisTag
T1
RBS 4G
The double of lysis buffer was used.
The DNA concentrations of the isolated plasmid DNAS were measured in NanoDrop (NanoDrop 1000 3.8.1):
CtermHisTag - T1: 15.9ng/μL
LacZ-beta pSB1C3: 40.1ng/μL
pBAD - RBS: 17.6ng/μL
CtermHisTag: 80.3ng/μL
T1: 49.3ng/μL
RBS 4G: 24.4ng/μL
The 280/260 value for samples 1 and 3 were too lower than 1.80, indicating presence of contaminations.
A gel electrophoresis in agarose gel (0.7%) with these plasmid DNAs was performed and the fragment-sizes were like expected, but no fragments for samples 1 and 3 were could be seen.
Another digestion was performed in RNS 4G and T1 and they were checked by gel electrophoresis in agarose gel (0.7%) before being used for ligation.
An O/N culture was prepared with pBAD in LB/chloramphenicol as previously.
Wednesday
William
The digestion of the 3A assembly protocol was done with:
N-His tag, pBad and constitutive promoter (17O) as part A’s (cut with EcoRI and SpeI). LacZ alpha stop, lacZ beta stop and RBS as part B’s (cut with PstI and XbaI). pSB1A3 and pSB1C3 as plasmids (cut with PstI, EcoRI).
Vilde
3A assembly. Tested colonies from 3A assembly from 04.08 and 05.08 by  PCR. Used TaKaRa enzyme and followed 50ul setup. Used elongation 4,3 min and annealing 55degrees. The gel showed only one positive colonies. The gel showed a lot of religated plasmids (bonds of 250bp). I troubleshootet the problem and found out that I will start to de phosphorylated the plasmid to prevent relegation.
Vilde
Minipreped O/N cultures from ligation 04.08. Wanted to test them on PCR to be sure that it is nothing wrong with the way we are doing PCR to test colonies.  Tested the concentration on nanodrop – all samples had a concentration between 50-80ng/ul and good 260/280 values. However all the samples had low 230/260 values that indicates that there are co-purified contaminants in the sample.
Vilde
Digested the minipreps and run gel on them. Run gel on the samples minipreped. The results showed that only Alpha-NS-Ehaj1 gave us the expected size of fragments in the gel. However for the smallest parts (RBS, T1 etc) we will not expect to see the bond from the part after digestion only the linearized plasmid. We can thus not say if these parts are correct or just re-ligated plasmids.
Vilde
Tested the one positive colony on PCR to be completely sure it is correct. Used gene specific primers (for Ehaj and LacZAlpha) combined with the iGEM VR and VF2 primers to be sure the fusion protein is in the plasmid.
Thursday
William, Håkon
Colonies from a plate with growth of LacZ-beta transformed bacteria were put in tubes, mixed with 20 µl water, heated to 96oC for 10 minutes and then centrifuged at 11.000 rpm for 10 minutes.
A PCR was set up in order to amplify the LacZ beta fragment, but there was no result on the gel.
Vilde
Run gel on PCR from yesterday. Run the gel on the PCR from  06.08. I got bonds as expected and can thus say that  the part LacZalpha NS – Ehaj1 is in the plasmid.
Vilde, Håkon
I tested more of the 3A assembly colonies from 05.08 on PCR. Hopefully not all of them are re-ligated plasmids. Used TaKaRa setup (25ul). I tested 3 different colonies from CtermHis –T1 and three from C-termHis-DT. Run the PCR with Håkon.
Vilde
Negative PCR results. Found out that Håkon had used a too short elongation time for my samples to be amplified. Have to do a new PCR on the colonies.
Vilde
Dephosphorylated pSB1C3. Used the pSB1CR Izadora cut (with EcoRI and PstI)and purified from gel yesterday. Used 17ul of purified pSB1C3, 2ul of 10X buffer and 1ul of phosphatase. Let the reaction in 37 degrees for 15 minutes and heat inactivated the enzymes by leaving the sample at 75degrees for 5 minutes. Stored the sample at -20 degrees.
Vilde
Assembled parts into dephosphorylated pSB1C3. Used the dephosphorylated pSB1C3 and parts digested 01.08. Ligation reaction sample: 2ul pSB1C3, 2ul Part, 1ul 10X buffer, 0,5uL enzyme and 4,5ul DH2O. Transformed 5ul and plated out on CAM plates. These parts will be the new biobrikcs we will send to the iGEM register.
Izadora
An A3 assembly was performed making a dephosphorylation with the enzyme FastAP Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase in the plasmids before ligating it and following the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Scientific).

Week 36
Week 37
Tuesday
Vilde
PCR on colonies. Tested LacZ Beta Non-stop, LacZ-bet Stop and the autotransporter Ehaj1 all in pSB1c3 plasmid backbone. Used VF and VR2 primers. Used Q5 polymerase and followed protocol supplied with the enzyme. Bands of around 500bp were observed for all three samples. This may be religated plasmid backbone.
Vilde
O/N cultures. Made Overnight cultures from the colonies tested even if the PCR did not show expected results. I will try to do another PCR and/Or sequence the isolated plasmid DNA to check if it is religated plasmid I observe.
Vilde
Made new LB Cam medium
Vilde
Made O/N culture of LacZ-gene from iGEM kit that I will use to make constructs.
Wednesday
Vilde
Minipreped the bacterial O/N culture containing LacZ-Gene from iGEM kit.
Vilde
It seems like we have a problem with the digestion of our constructs and or plasmid since we get religated plasmids. I tested all the restriction enzymes stepwise with the corresponding buffer. I used the protocol and setup supplied with the enzyme. I used the EcoRI buffer for EcoRI enzyme, NEB3.1 for SpeI and Cutsmart for XbaI and PstI. I cut a known plasmid from the iGEM kit. Analysis of  cut constructs in a gel shows that all restriction enzymes are functional, but has to be done with correct buffer.
I cut the linear plasmid backbone in a stepwise matter
Vilde
Cut pSB1C3. Cut one sample of the plasmid backbone with EcoRI and one with PstI. Used correct buffer for both enzymes. I cut the samples at 37 degrees for 1 hour.
Vilde
PCR cleaned up of the cur plasmid backbone samples eluted the samples in 20ul dH2O.
Vilde
Cut the plasmids backbone with the other enzyme using supplied protocol and buffer. Stored the stepwise cut plasmid backbone in -20 freezer for usage in ligation later.
Friday
Vilde
PCR to amplify new constructs from plasmid DNA. Used gene specific primers and template corresponding to the construct I will make. Used the whole LacZ gene as template for LacZbeta NS, lacZBeta Stop, LazC alpha NS. Used isolated plasmids containing the autotransporter gene to amplify the autotransporter and signaling peptide. I used Q5 polymerase and a 50ul reaction volume. The samples were cut and ligated into already cut plasmid (10.09) and transformed into Top10 cells.
Vilde
Sent samples to sequencing. Ehaj1 pSB1c3 with VF2 and VR primers, pBAd-RBS with VR primers. Used 5ul DNA  (80ng/ul) and 5ul 5mM primers
Vilde
Tested colonies on PCR. Tested colonies with constructs made and transformed 12.09. Only Ehaj2 pSB1C3 showed correct size. The other showed religated plasmid. I will test more colonies.

Friday
Vilde
Dephosphorylated already stepwise cut pSB1C3 to prevent re-ligation.
Vilde
Ligated the dephosphorylated, cut pSB1C3 into constructs made 18.09; LacZ Beta Non stop, LacZ beta Stop,LacZ alpha NS, Invful (autotransporter) and Signaling peptide. Followed protocol supplied by the T4 ligase and transformed into TOP10 cells.
Vilde
Checked sequencing results. Seems like the LacZ beta gene is correct. It does not contain the EcoRI site in the middle of the gene.
Saturday
Vilde
Checked colonies on PCR (from 19.09). Used TaKaRa PCR and VF2, VR primers. The colonies did not give bands as expected.
Vilde
Checked Sequencing results. It seems like our constructs do not contain the whole suffix. I made new reverse primers to test if this lack of the whole suffix may be due to wrong primers.
Week 39
Thursday
Vilde
Got the new primers and set up PCR to make new constructs. Used Q5 and gene specific primers. Made: LacZBeta NS, LacZ Beta Stop, LacZ alpha Ns, Ehaj1, Ehaj2 and signaling peptide. All were positive except lacZ alpha non stop.
Vilde
Stepwise digestion of the PCR products and pSB1C3. Cut the constructs and the plasmid backbone stepwise using the correct buffer to each enzyme and a PCR cleanup in between.
Vilde
Dephosphorylated the plasmid backbone to prevent relegation
Vilde
Ligated the cut constructs into the cut and dephosphorylated plasmid backbone. Used T4 ligase and followed the protocol supplied with the enzyme. Transformed only LacZ beta Non stop due to lack of competent cells.
