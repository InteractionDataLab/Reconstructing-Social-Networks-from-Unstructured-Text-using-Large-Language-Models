As the first team from the University of Oslo participating in this competition our main focus was to get to know the principles behind iGEM and all the different aspects of the competition as much as planning and do the project. The human practices were also looked on as one of our most important aspects because this idea of biological engineering is completely new and unknown to most people in Oslo – we changed that!
We are proud of our communication work. We have written articles published in different journals, held presentations with different levels of scientific content, got interviewed by journalists - and managed to deal with difficult situations happening when dealing with the press.
Our team, UiOslo Norway with the project microOrganizer fulfill the criteria for the bronze medal:
Team registration.
The team has been registrered. Se our official team profile .
Complete Judging form.
We have submitted our judging form.
Team Wiki.
Our team wiki is completed. You are reading it now :)
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We are looking forward to presenting our work at the Giant Jamboree in Boston, both with a poster and a talk.
The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Our team page includes descriptions of what each team member has done, and the lab notebook and events page specifies who has done what. In the acknowledgement page we thank and attribute all non-student contributions to the project.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
The new BioBricks: "Beta-galactosidase subunit Ω" and "signaling peptide" has been made, sequenced, registered and sent in to the iGEM registry.
Our biggest achievement is still that we, as a group of 7 students, have planned and completed an iGEM project.
Created using Bootstrap and jQuery.
