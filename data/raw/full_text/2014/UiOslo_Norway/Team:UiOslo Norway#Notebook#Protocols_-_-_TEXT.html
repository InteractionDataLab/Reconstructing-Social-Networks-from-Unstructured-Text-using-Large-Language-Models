Protocols
These are the protocols from our lab work. Click one of them to view the description. Red colored text in the protocols signifies problems we met during the procedures, and the solutions we found for them.
Digestion
Digestion must be done stepwise with correct buffer to correct restriction enzyme. A minimum amount of 250 ng DNA must be used. After digestion the samples must be run on a gel to be sure the cutting worked.
Follow the protocol and Buffer supplied with the restriction enzymes:
EcoRI has to be cut with the EcoRI Buffer
PstI has to be cut with the Neb3.1 Buffer
XbaI and SpeI have to be cut with the cutsmart buffer.
Each part/plasmid is cut with two restriction enzymes.
A PCR clean up must be done between the cutting steps to make sure that each restriction enzyme is only used with its corresponding buffer.
For best results: Do PCR clean up before ligation.
We have tried to follow the protocol supplied by iGEM. This does not give positive results. We have also tried to use the CutSmart buffer and the NEB 3.1 buffer for all the enzymes - without success. The EcoRI enzyme will only work with the EcoRI buffer. The PstI enzyme works badly with the cutsmart buffer. SpeI and XbaI only works with cutsmart. Always do the digestion in two steps!
Dephosphorylation of plasmid
To prevent religation of the plasmid we dephosphorylated it before ligation. We followed the protocol supplied by the enzyme and inactivated the enzyme before ligation.
Best result is obtained when PCR clean up is done on the dephosphorylated sample.
When this step is not done we get a lot of false positive colonies - Plasmids that are religated  and thus forms a circular plasmids that are easily transformed  into bacteria. When this happens you will see bands of ca 250 bp on a gel after PCR with VF and VR2 primers.
Ligation
With T4-ligase. Follow the protocol supplied with the T4 ligase and not the iGEM protocol.
Remember to use the correct amount of buffer! (see protocol). The best results are obtained when using equimolar amount of plasmid and constructs. However we also get results when using the same amount of plasmid and constructs. We did not always heat kill the enzyme.
NB! Remember to dephosphorylate the plasmid before ligation!
We followed the iGEM protocol and used the wrong amount of buffer for a long time. Follow the protocol supplied with the Enzyme.
PCR
We used different polymerases for different usage during the project.
To make constructs and amplify plasmid backbones we used the high efficient, exonuclease active Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB).  We followed protocol supplied by the enzyme and used a 50µl Reaction volume and 50 ng DNA.
PCR Setup:
98degrees, 30 sec
98 degrees, 10 sec
55 degrees, 30 sec
72 degrees, 2 min (go to step 2, 28 times)
72 degrees, 2 min
8 degrees, hold
To check if colonies contain our construct we used TaKaRa ExTaqTM Hot start Version.
One bacteria colony were re-suspended in 20ul dH2O
The sample was put on 95-100 degrees in 10 minutes to break the bacteria and free the plasmid into the solution
The sample was centrifuged at full speed for 2 min. The plasmid is then in the supernatant.
We used 2ul of this supernatant in the PCR reaction.
We followed protocol supplied by the enzyme and used a 50 µl Reaction volume
PCR Setup:
98 degrees, 1 min
98 degrees, 10 sec
55 degrees, 30 sec
72 degrees, 3,5 min (go to step 2, 30 times)
72 degrees, 5 min
8 degrees, hold
PCR clean up
Followed protocol supplied with the kit. Eluted DNA in 20µl ddH2O
Making of N-His tag
We made our own seven histidin long N-terminal his tag by ordering complementary oligos and anneal them to each other.
The two oligoes were mixed and heated up to 95degrees. The temperature was then slowly decreased to find the correct annealing temperature for the oligoes. The temperature was decreased until 50 degrees over a 5-8h period. This was done in a PCR machine or in a water bath.
The concentration of oligos was: 20uM.
Digestion (NEB restriction enzymes)
We used 500ng DNA in a 25 µl digestion volume. 2,5 µl buffer (supplied with the enzyme), 0,5µl Enzyme and water up to a total amount of 25µl.  Digested in 37 degrees for 1-2h.
Ligation (T4 – NEB ligase)
We used 50ng Plasmid (2 µl), equimolar amount if construct, 2µl buffer (10X), 1µ T4 ligase and water up to a total volume of 20µ. Ligated at Room Temperature for 30min – 1h.
3A assembly – iGEM protocol
Part A: digested with EcoRI and SpeI
Part B: digested with PstI and XbaI
Plasmid backbone: digested with EcoRI, PstI and DpnI
Equimolar of each part where ligated together
Assembly into pSB1C3
