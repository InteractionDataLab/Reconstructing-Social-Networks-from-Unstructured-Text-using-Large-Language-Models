UiOslo Norway
We are the team from the University of Oslo.
The team members
Håkon Høgset
About
Half human and half machine, Håkon obviously has difficulties expressing his sense of humor. He is designed to handle advanced concepts of philosophy, mathematics and molecular biology, but not to remember where his keys are. Håkon is studying for a masters degree in molecular biology at the University of Oslo. He has grown up at Manglerud (suburbs) in Oslo, but despite of that he’s really doing ok. When he heard about IGEM he thought immediately that this was up his alley. Therefore he started recruiting people to the team in the student cafeteria.
Main contribution
I have contributed mostly to the lab work and the communication. I have worked on the idea and identified parts and systems we could use in our project. I have also held several presentations about iGEM and connected us with the press department at the MN-faculty. I have written applications for grants and raised travelling fundings from the Norwegian Biochemical Society. I participated on the Synthetic biology seminar in Trondheim and hold lectures on «Karrieredagen» and «Ungforsk». I worked most of the summer in the lab.
Fun fact
Has curls, and is actually a real human.
Promise
If we win the grand prize, I'm buying a big, fat gold ring that I'm gonna wear for the rest of my life.
William Brynildsen
About
I am a 25 year old master student in molecular biology and more particularly I am using bioinformatics on next-generation data to investigate the evolution of transposons in cod (not the video game). I am also intrigued by the field of synthetic biology and the possibilities that lies within. Beside all this school stuff I enjoy board games and playing the piano and the guitar and spending time with family and friends.
Main contribution
I have worked mostly on the lab, but also been part of the human practices, including the career day, ungforsk, lecture by Drew Endy in Trondheim, synthetic biology day and media stuff like the interview with Universitas. I have also blogged. I have created all the illustrations (using somersault1824.com package for raw images).
Fun fact
My dad was born in Africa.
Promise
If we win I will swim over the atlantic sea back home.
Vilde Olsson
About
I'm Vilde; 24 years old and currently taking my masters in plant genetics. I am passionate by (almost) everything in the field of molecular biology, so yes; a bit geeky. Outside the world of science I love downhill skiing, surfing and a good, cold beer (preferably accompanied by some good friends and snacks).
Main contribution
Discuss and come with ideas to the project. Plan and design the Lab work. Work full days in the lab during the summer. Troubleshooted and made an optimal protocol for cloning of the parts. Help in interviews with media. Writing on wiki. Holding presentation about iGEM and the project during a couple arrangements.
Fun fact
Is actually 2cm shorter than what her passport says, since she stood on her toes when they measured!
Promise
If we win I will spend a day hugging random people at the street - pretending to know them.
Sumaya Yusuf
About
I'm a 24 year old in my final year of the five year program in Pharmacy. I love learning about different subjects and for me pharmacy was the perfect of natural sciences mix. This interest is also why I joined the iGEM team. I like staying busy and having a lot to do. Which is why when I have a little spare time, I like to read even though I don’t always manage to finish reading a book I start on.
Main contribution
My main contribution in this project was working in the lab during the most summer and being the one of the main contacts to the Science Library. I’ve held presentations about iGEM, written several blogposts and written a couple of articles for the media. I've also written the ethics portion on our wiki.
Fun fact
I’ve done cosplaying before.
Promise
If we win I will scream something iGEM related from the top of my lungs,as loud as I possibly can from the highest point in Oslo. I.E. "UiOSLO iGEM  freaking rulez!" ...I’ll most likely have found a better sentence to scream by the time we’re in Boston.
Izadora Lorrany
About
I am 23 years old, brazilian and finishing my bachelor in biochemistry. I love science and have worked with Human Parasitology for 3 years. My dream is to become a researcher and contribute to society with my discoveries. I am passionate for my family (too emotive by the way), singing and brazilian food. In my free time I like to read, be with my friends and watch series.
Main contribution
I was part of the molecular biologists group and worked mainly with the project plan, progress and troubleshooting.
Fun fact
I used to practice gymnastics (yes, with somersaults! =D)
Promise
If we win I will give a short demonstration of my gymnastic skills in Giant Jamboree.
Stian Lågstad
About
I'm studying informatics for technical and scientific applications. That fits me well, as I've always been a huge computer geek. I'm interested in bioinformatics, so I'm planning to write my masters assigment with the biomedical informatics group at my university. When I'm not hammering away on my keyboard I can be found camping, playing football (soccer) or hanging out at my faculty's student society: Realistforeningen.
Main contribution
My main contribution to the project has been on the technical computing side. Creating the wiki, our blogs, social media sites and so on. I also had a little time in the lab - a cool, new experience for me. Other than that I've given presentations about IGEM and our project a couple of times.
Fun fact
Obsessed about the number 42.
Promise
If we win, I'm getting a synthetic biology tattoo.
Elina Melteig
About
I’m an extrovert, math-loving, partly nerdy person who believes that science makes the world a better place! I study bionanotechnology and in a years time I will finish my masters degree. When I don’t work on the iGEM-project I look for algae for my masters project. I love traveling and I’ve visited a lot of places. In addition I’ve taken a bachelor in Arabic, and I love learning other languages.
Main contribution
My main contribuition in this project was to get media attention to our project. I also actively had contact with the faculty for natural sciences in order to give presentations to students. I have also held several presentations, and written articles for the media. I've also helped out in the lab and tried to make N-term-his-tag. I learned a lot about lab work and then discovered that something was wrong with the primers. I've also written about human practices on our wiki. I've also done some administrative work concerning our travel.
Fun fact
I learned to swim before I could walk.
Promise
If we win the big prize I will face my fear and watch “The Black Sheep” alone. In the dark.

Dirk Linke
Associate Professor - Section for Genetics and Evolutionary Biology, Department for Biosciences, University of Oslo
My research group focusses on the structure and function of the bacterial cell surface.
Our work is typically comparative – we do not work on a single pathogenic “pet” organism, but instead compare related surface proteins from different species, studying their similarities and subtle differences. Our work is also interdisciplinary – we use methods from bioinformatics, structural biology and biophysics on top of classical methods from microbiology, molecular biology and biochemistry.
