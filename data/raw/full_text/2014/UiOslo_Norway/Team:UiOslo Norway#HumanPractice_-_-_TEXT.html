Human Practice
What is science worth if nobody knows about it? How can it be applied?
Our team is concerned with these issues. We want the society to know what scientific advancements are made. When society knows, it’s easier to put the achievements into practice so they can benefit the society as a whole.
Our generation will face some major issues concerning the environment. We are keen to show people that there are also solutions. Therefore we have put some efforts into the communication of science!
We have chosen to communicate science mainly through media and presentations. We have also had a blog and used social media actively.
Created using Bootstrap and jQuery.
