The members of the Adhesion Group
The sticky part of the team have been working on merging our systems into one and are also developing a draft for the future Adhesion system! These guy’s will stick to anything, so a hug from them is a hug for life! The adhesion group consists of one biotechnology master student, one bioinformatics master student and two bachelor students, and one bachelor student in chemical engineering.
