The members of the Targeting Group
The amazing Targeting Group is focusing on our Targeting/homing system, which will give our bacteria the ability to home towards our target, Y. enterocolitica!  These hot shots always hit their target, bullseye, and is made up of three biotechnology bachelors students, one biology master student and one lonely biomedicine bachelor student.
