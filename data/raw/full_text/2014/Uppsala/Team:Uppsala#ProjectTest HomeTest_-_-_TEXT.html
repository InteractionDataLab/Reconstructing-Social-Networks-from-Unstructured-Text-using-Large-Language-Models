Introduction/Abstract
With the spreading of Antibiotic resistance society has a big problem to tackle to save the people of tomorrow. If we do not find an alternetiv to antibiotics WHO estimates that the world will be thrown back to the hospital situation of the 1800’s. This year Uppsala iGem tries to combat this problem by using the pathogens own quorum sencing system to help probiotic bacteria find and kill that specific pathogen leaving the gut flora intact.
