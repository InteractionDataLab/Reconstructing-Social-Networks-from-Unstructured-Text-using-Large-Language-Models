The members of the Modeling Group
The Uppsala Top Models have been focusing on optimizing and modeling our system through a cell-cell interaction model and a math based model on population level! These fashionista nerds are both smart and beautiful and are always able to, in the words of Tim Gun, “Make it work!”.  The modeling group consists of  one bioinformatics master student and two bachelors students.
