Project: Introduction of the concept of Synthetic Biology and the meaning of  iGEM
21st Sep. 2014 Briefing Session in university
To make iGEM and Synthetic Biology be known to more people, especially the students who are major in biology and who intend to engage in biology in the coming future, BUCT-China came to Beijing University of Chemical Technology to deliver a report to the lower grades.
Before the report, we also took some other measures like designing our poster and delivering leaflets. Besides, A wide range of activities in social networks as MicroBlog and WeChat are organized.
In the keynote, six of our team members introduced the contents and the meaning of synthetic biology in turn; explain the iGEM concept and previous iGEM competitions, along with the Giant Jamboree. Also, we made necessary introduction of our own project, which was really of great popularity among the junior.
After the report, there were still some students interested in the competition and asked several  questions like the ideas about synthetic biology as far as they were concerned and the information of how to join in  the next year’s iGEM competition. Obviously they got known much more. Meanwhile, we’d got a lot ideas from the audience. Without hesitation, we’ve made it a success as far as the meaning and the adequate influence. Our team members also gained more confidence of ourselves.
