Project Description
Content
Our project is based on genetic engineering to construct a recombinant plasmid and transform it into a host cell E.coli, given the comprehensive toxicity test ability and the function of the particular toxin detection. Using of microfluidic chips will accomplish a rapid detection of samples. Eventually, we will build a complete set of water quality toxin rapid detection system.
The system is composed of a sampling device chip, lyophilized powder of recombinant strains and testing instruments. We use chips with recombinant bacteria to suck up the water samples, then put chips into the instrument. When the instrument works, we will acquire an automatic detection of physical and chemical characteristics of the samples after a period of time. And a test report is additional to show the final result.
The advantages of this system we believe are: Firstly, the recombinant host has strong resistance to toxin, providing a luminescent gene LuxAB in vivo and constructing a more stable platform for the expression of many biosensors. Secondly, microfluidic chips’ usage enhance the level of trace detection. Thirdly, inserted biosensors will completely accomplish the determination of one or several toxins, which can be taken as credible references to the comprehensive toxicity assessments. Multiple collocation of variable Biosensors also reflects the modular though modularization idea .

Conclusions
It's important for teams to describe all the creativity that goes into an iGEM project, along with all the great ideas your team will come up with over the course of your work.
It's also important to clearly describe your achievements so that judges will know what you tried to do and where you succeeded. Please write your project page such that what you achieved is easy to distinguish from what you attempted.
