K1513001: Fast-type merR biosensor
K1513001: Fast-type merR biosensor
merR gene acts as a regulator which can promote downstream genes’ expression in the presence of Hg (II), the detailed mechanism of it is well-known as a whole. This summer we aimed at finding out a fast as well as accurate method to detect the Hg (II) in water. However, we found that the former method costs much time, so we turn to look for a rapid way which meets our expectation.
