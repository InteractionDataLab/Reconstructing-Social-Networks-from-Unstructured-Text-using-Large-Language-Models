P&P Approach
This year, we decided to evaluate a problem related with the topic of our project based on, heart attacks and brain ischemia. Our aim is to determine what can be done and how we can adapt synthetic biology into the solution.
We considered human practice as a distinct project. Therefore, we can separate our approach into four modules or columns to maximize the efficiency and to establish a continual progress going accumulatively. These modules are identification, clarification, specialization, application, separately.
M1-Identification
This module includes the analyzation and differentiation of the aspects of heart attack and ischemia. We intend to identify how big the problem is, what kind of features it poses and how much people are aware of them.
To understand the depth of the problem, we aim to perform a survey throughout our environment and our university. Additionally, to evaluate a problem which lies underneath and to inform people attending it, we proposed our survey to iGEMers and received some useful information. After our analyze, we could determine the aspects and the degree of heart health risks. To see more results, visit our page.
M2-Clarification
As the second step, we try to engage people to inform about the problem and its potential other health risks. Taking the data we obtained during first module as an advantage, we want to clarify every feature that are related with people and which can be taken under control easily. According to this, we especially focused on the fat and salt consumption which are the main risk factors about heart diseases. We also calculated an iGEMer’s daily calorie intake to compare with expected normal intake to show how healthy we nourish ourselves. The results of this module can be found here.
M3-Specialization
We want to go further about our evaluation and research about people awareness. In this module, we have asked experts  and related stakeholders of the health sector about how we can raise awareness more effectively and which steps must be taken for a more successful approach. In this view, we had several meetings with cardiologists, Turkish Cardiologists Association and Turkish Heart Society experts and discussed our project and ideas. To see the details, visit our page.
M4-Application
Lastly, we have come with the idea of designating how much our proposed treatment cost and if it is really more beneficial than the current treatment, what are the advantages etc. We have done several researches about the-state-of-art clinical practice and methods and compared the features of new and old. Additionally, we criticized critic our approach in the aspects of treatment management and monitoring, safety and security and produced new ideas to enhance its clinical potential and practice features. These opinions and studies can be found in detail here.
