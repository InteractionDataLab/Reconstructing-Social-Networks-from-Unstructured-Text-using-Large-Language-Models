1. Cell Count
1-) Wash the cells in the flask with 5 mL 1X PBS twice. At this stage removing PBS completely is very important. Otherwise activity of Trypsin decreases
2-) Add 2 mL Trypsin on cells. Be careful; Trypsin should be spreaded whole surface. Then wait 5 minute at 37°C. Because trypsin works maximum activity at 37 ° C.
3-) After we sure that cells remove from surface completely, wash the surface carefully with 5 mL medium via pipetting .
4-) Take all the mixture which we prepared to falcon tubes( 15 mL) and centrifuge 6 minutes.
5-) Supernatant should be taken carefully without damaging to cells.
6-) Add 5 mL medium on pellet and dissolve the pellet in medium.
7-) Take 100 mL from cell mixture, take 100 mL from Tripan-Blue and mix in eppendorf.
8-) Take 20 micro liters to Hemocytometer( Thoma lam) and count after then.
9-) We will put the lam to microscope. Lam’s H zone should be under the light.
10-) There are 5 areas that should be counted.
11-) Total number of cells which at 5 areas, are counted at arithmetic average is counted.
12-) To count the total cell number;
*Cell number: Average cell count x dilution factor x
*Dilution Factor: It is the rate between dye and cell contents. For this protocol dilution factor is 2.(1+1)
*For example; 68x2x=1.360.000(cell count per mL). But we want to seed 500.000 cell per mL.
1 mL 1.3 million
X 0.5 million
X= 0,385 mL = 385 microliters
*So we will take 0.385 microliters to seed 500.000 cells.
*According to the material ( where will we seed our cells? Flask, petri, well..) amount of medium is counted and the cells are seeded.
*For example, according to six well-plate; 2 mL medium is put, Than 385 microlitres cells are added.
*For six well-plate, the best situation is adding 500.000 cells.

7.Gel Purification
Gel Purification
Gel purification using&Thermo Scientific GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit
-All purification steps should be carried out at room temperature.
-All centrifugations should be carried out in a table-top microcentrifuge at sup12000 x g
Excise gel slice containing the DNA fragment using a clean scalpel or razor blade. Cut as close to the DNA as possible to minimize the gel volume. Place the gel slice into a pre-weighed 1.5 ml tube and weigh. Record the weight of the gel slice.
Note. If the purified fragment will be used for cloning reactions, avoid damaging the DNA through UV light exposure. Minimize UV exposure to a few seconds or keep the gel slice on a glass or plastic plate during UV illumination.
Add 1:1 volume of Binding Buffer to the gel slice (volume: weight)(e.g., add 100 ul of Binding Buffer for every 100 mg of agarose gel).
Note. For gels with an agarose content greater than 2%, a dd 2:1 volumes of Binding Buffer to the gel slice.
Incubate the gel mixture at 50-60°C for 10 min or until the gel slice is completely dissolved. Mix the tube by inversion every few minutes to facilitate the melting process. Ensure that the gel is completely dissolved. Vortex the gel mixture briefly before loading on the column. Check the color of the solution. A yellow color indicates an optimal pH for DNA binding. If the color of the solution is orange or violet, add 10 ul of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 solution and mix. The color of the mix will become yellow.
Optional: use this step only when DNA fragment is inf 500 bp or sup10 kb long. If the DNA fragment is inf 500 bp, add a 1:2 volume of 100% isopropanol to the so lubilized gel solution (e.g. 100 ul of isopropanol should be added to 100 mg gel slice solubilized in 100 ul of Binding Buffer). Mix thoroughly. If the DNA fragment is sup10 kb , add a 1:2 volume of water to the solubilized gel solution (e.g. 100 ul of water should be added to 100 mg gel slice solubilized in 100 ul of Binding Buffer). Mix thoroughly.
Transfer up to 800 ul of the solubilized gel solution (from step 3 or 4) to the GeneJET purification column. Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same collection tube.
Note. If the total volume exceeds 800 ul, the solution can be added to the column in stages. After each application, centrifuge the column for 30-60 s and discard the flow-through aftereach spin. Repeat until the entire volume has been applied to the column membrane. Do not exceed 1 g of total agarose gel per column.
Optional: use this additional binding step only if the purified DNA will be used for sequencing. Add 100 ul of Binding Buffer to the GeneJET purification column. Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same collection tube.
Add 700 ul of Wash Buffer (diluted with ethanol as described on p. 3) to the GeneJET purification column. Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the same collection tube.
Centrifuge the empty GeneJET purification column for an additional 1 min to completely remove residual wash buffer.
Note. This step is essential to avoid residual ethanol in the purified DNA solution. The presence of ethanol in the DNA sample may inhibit downstream enzymatic reactions.
Transfer the GeneJET purification column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (not included). Add 50 ul of NFW to the center of the purification column membrane. Centrifuge for 1 min.
Note. For low DNA amounts the elution volumes can be reduced to increase DNA concentration. An elution volume between 20-50 ul does not significantly reduce the DNA yield. However, elution volumes less than 10 ul are not recommended. If DNA fragment is sup10 kb, prewarm Elution Buffer to 65°C before applying to column. If the elution volume is 10 ul and DNA amount is inf5 ug, incubate column for 1 min at room temperature before centrifugation.
Discard the GeneJET purification column and store the purified DNA at -20°C.

Midiprep Using invitrogen Midiprep Kit
Preparing Cell Lysate
1. For high copy number plasmids, use 15–25 mL of an overnight LB culture per sample in a disposable 50-mL conical tube.
Note: If you are using >25 mL of culture volume of high copy plasmids, add twice the amount of Resuspension Buffer (R3) with RNase A, Lysis Buffer (L7), and Precipitation Buffer (N3) as directed in steps 3, 4, and 5, below, for best results.
For low copy number plasmids, use 25–100 mL of an overnight LB culture per sample in a 50-mL tube.
2. Harvest the cells by centrifuging the overnight LB culture at 4000 × g for 10 minutes. Remove all medium.
3. Add 4 mL Resuspension Buffer (R3) with RNase A to the cell pellet and resuspend the cells until homogeneous.
4. Add 4 mL Lysis Buffer (L7). Mix gently by inverting the capped tube until the lysate mixture is thoroughly homogenous. Do not vortex. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Note: Do not allow lysis to proceed for more than 5 minutes.
5. Add 4 mL Precipitation Buffer (N3) and mix immediately by inverting the capped tube until the mixture is thoroughly homogeneous. Do not vortex.
6. Centrifuge the mixture at >12,000 × g for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Note: If the pellet does not adhere to the bottom of the tube, incubate the tube at room temperature for 5 minutes to allow the lysate and gelatinous pellet to separate. Pipet the clear lysate into another, sterile tube and centrifuge at >12,000 × g at room temperature for 5 minutes to remove any remaining cellular debris.
7. Proceed to Binding and Washing DNA, next page.
Binding and Washing DNA
1. Load the supernatant from step 6 (Preparing Cell Lysate) onto the equilibrated column. Allow the solution in the column to drain by gravity flow.
2. Wash the column twice with 10 mL Wash Buffer (W8). Allow the solution in the column to drain by gravity flow after each wash. Discard the flow-through.
3. Proceed to Eluting and Precipitating DNA. For DNA precipitation, you can use the PureLink® HiPure Precipitator Module (page 34) which allows you to precipitate DNA within 10 minutes without using a centrifuge. Alternatively, follow Eluting and Precipitating DNA on page 14 to perform traditional DNA precipitation using centrifugation. Refer to the manual supplied with the PureLink® HiPure Precipitator Module for a detailed protocol.
Eluting and Precipitating DNA
1. Place a sterile 15-mL centrifuge tube (elution tube) under the column.
2. Add 5 mL Elution Buffer (E4) to the column to elute the DNA. Allow the solution to drain by gravity flow. Do not force out any remaining solution. The elution tube contains the purified DNA. Discard the column.
3. Add 3.5 mL isopropanol to the elution tube. Mix well.
Note: Proceed to the protocol described in the PureLink® HiPure Precipitator manual after this step, if you are using the precipitator module.
4. Centrifuge the tube at >12,000 × g for 30 minutes at 4°C. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.
5. Resuspend the pellet in 3 mL 70% ethanol.
6. Centrifuge the tube at >12,000 × g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.
7. Air-dry the pellet for 10 minutes.
8. Resuspend the DNA pellet in 200 µL TE Buffer (TE). For low copy number plasmids, use 100 µL of TE Buffer.
Note: Occasionally, insoluble particles may be present. These particles do not influence the quality of the DNA and can be easily removed. To remove insoluble particles, centrifuge the DNA solution at high speed for 1 minute at room temperature. Transfer the supernatant (DNA sample) into a fresh tube. Storing DNA To avoid repeated freezing and thawing of DNA, store the purified DNA at 4°C for immediate use or aliquot the DNA and store at –20°C for long-term storage.

18.tPA Assay
Using AssaySense Human tPA Chromogenic Activity Kit
Assay Summary
Add 80 μl of AssayMix and 20 μl of standard and/or sample.
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
Read at 405 nm every hour for 8 hours. Read at 405 nm every hour from 20 hours up to 26 hours.
Introduction
Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is a 68-kDa serine protease that converts the zymogen plasminogen into the active serine protease plasmin, which digests fibrin and induces the dissolution of fibrin clots (1). tPA is synthesized by endothelial cells in normal blood vessels and displays relatively high affinity for fibrin, suggesting that it functions predominately in physiological thrombolysis in vivo
Principle of Assay
The AssaySense Human tPA Chromogenic Activity Kit is developed to determine human tPA activity in plasma and cell culture supernatants. The assay measures the ability of tPA to activate the plasminogen to plasmin in coupled or indirect assays that contain tPA, plasminogen, and a plasmin-specific synthetic substrate. The amount of plasmin produced is quantitated using a highly specific plasmin substrate releasing a yellow para-nitroaniline (pNA) chromophore. The change in absorbance of the pNA in the reaction solution at 405 nm is directly proportional to the tPA enzymatic activity.
Reagents
The activity assay kit contains sufficient reagents to perform 100 tests using the microplate method.
• Microplate: One 96 well polystyrene microplate (12 strips of 8 wells)
• Sealing Tapes: Each kit contains 3 precut, pressure sensitive sealing tapes that can be cut to fit the format of the individual assay.
• Assay Diluent: 30 ml
• tPA Standard: 1 vial, human tPA (32 IU)
• Human Plasminogen: 1 vial
• Plasmin Substrate: 2 vials
Sample Collection, Preparation and Storage
• Plasma: Collect plasma using one-tenth volume of acidified 0.5 M sodium citrate (pH 4.0) as an anticoagulant to prevent tPA-PAI complex formation. Centrifuge samples at 3000 x g for 15 minutes. Prior to the analysis, dilute samples 1:8 with Assay Diluent and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes to overcome interference by plasmin inhibitors (6 - 7). Samples can be stored at < -80°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
• Cell Culture Supernatants: Centrifuge cell culture media at 3000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C to remove debris. Collect supernatants and assay. Samples can be store at < -80°C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
Reagent Preparation
• Standard Curve: Reconstitute 32 IU of Human tPA Standard with 0.8 ml of Assay Diluent to generate a solution of 40 IU/ml. Allow the standard to sit for 15 minutes with gentle agitation prior to making dilutions. Prepare duplicate or triplicate standard points by serially diluting the standard solution (40 IU/ml) 1:4 with Assay Diluent to produce 10, 2.5, 0.625, 0.156, and 0.039 IU/ml solutions. Any remaining solution should be frozen at -20°C and used within 30 days.
Assay Procedure
• Prepare all reagents, working standards and samples as instructed. Bring all reagents to room temperature before use. The assay is performed at room temperature (25°C) for specific sample binding and at 37°C for chromogenic activity assay. Seal the plate with sealing tape at each step.
• Remove excess microplate strips from the plate frame.
• Assay Mix: Freshly prepare the desired volume of the Assay Mix by combining the following reagents according to the assay numbers (n). It is recommended that Assay Mix be made in 10% excess.
• Add 80 μl of the above Assay Mix to each well.
• Add 20 μl of Human tPA Standard or samples per well and mix gently.
• Read the absorbance at 405 nm at zero minutes for background O.D. Seal the plate with sealing tape. Incubate the plate at 37°C in a humid incubator to avoid drying the plate.
• For HIGH tPA activity samples, read the absorbance at 405 nm every hour up to 8 hours.
• For LOW tPA activity samples, start to read the absorbance at 405 nm from 20 hours up to 26 hours.
Data Analysis
• Calculate the mean value of the duplicate or triplicate for each standard and sample.
• To generate a standard curve from the initial reaction time, plot the graph using the standard concentrations on the x-axis and the corresponding mean 405 nm absorbance or change in absorbance per minute (ΔA/min) on the y-axis. The best-fit line can be determined by regression analysis of the linear portion of the curve.
• Determine the unknown sample concentration from the Standard Curve and multiply the value by the dilution factor.
Standard Curve
• The curve is provided for illustration only. A standard curve should be generated each time the assay is performed.
Performance Characteristics
• The minimum detectable dose of tPA is typically ~ 0.03 IU/ml.
• No significant cross-reactivity or interference was observed.
