The data of our new favourite parts
BBa_K1456005 Oxygen dependent degradation (ODD) domain from HIF-1α : ODD is a peptide sequence which is targeted by ubiquitin-proteosome degradation pathway when enough oxygen is present within the media as a result of the hydroxylation process. In hypoxic conditions, this process is inhibited and ODD can survive with its cohesive components. Therefore we aim to use this feature in designing a novel hypoxia sensing device.
BBa_K1456006 Hypoxia Response Element (HRE) HREs are transcription factor binding sites for the hypoxia inducible factor-1alfa. In hypoxic conditions, the yield of HRE including promoter increases significantly. This part is planned to be used in the main sensor device of our design.
BBa_K14569999 Kappa-B Response Element (kB-RE) kB-RE, a naturally sensing operon of hypoxia inducible factor 1alfa, is activated in some circumstances which pose cellular stress such as inflammation or oxidation. ROS presence also results in the transcription on kB-RE; therefore we intend to use it as ROS inducible promoter.
We have designed and characterized the following parts:
BBa_K1456003 Superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1): SOD-1 is a natural and potent antioxidant enzyme existing in most of the human cells. It converts free radicals and reactive oxygen species, which are responsible for the oxidative damage, into hydrogen peroxide that is less harmful. It has three subtypes with various locations; therefore we have chosen SOD-1 for its optimum and ideal region in the cell.
BBa_K1456002 Glutathione Peroxidase-1 (GPx-1) GPx-1 is another antioxidant enzyme which takes over the duty from SOD-1 by detoxifying hydrogen peroxide radical into water and oxygen. GPx-1 subtype of this enzyme has been decided to use in our project because of its convenience with our design.
BBa_K1456001 Human Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA):  tPA activates zymogen protein, plasminogen, which begin to cleave the main component of the clot, fibrin. It is the most potent drug being used clinically, so far. This part will help us to dissolve the hypoxia causing clot in a vessel.
BBa_K1456003 Aprotinin: Oxygen Radical Inhibitor Aprotinin is a serine protease inhibitor which reacts with naturally occurring proteases present in the cell to prevent possible enzyme conversions. One of these interferences is the transformation of xanthine dehydrogenase, which can produce almost 80% of free radicals by becoming xanthine oxidase. Aprotinin can prevent the production such radicals by inhibiting this reaction.
