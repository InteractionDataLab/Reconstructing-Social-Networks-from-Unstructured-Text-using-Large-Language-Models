ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
As ATOMS-Turkiye iGEM team, we would like to thank everyone supporting us during this tiring but enjoying progress in entire year. This thankfulness comes from deep in our hearts.
We also want to thank you very much to rector of our university, the board of trustees and our university for their precious support while we are carrying out this year’s difficult process which we attempted to perform novel procedures and project materials in our laboratory.
Additionally, we thank you to our advisor Ayşe Çelik for her kind support and helps. She spent her precious time or her entire day sometimes, and helped gratefully especially on our modelling work.
Special thanks to:
