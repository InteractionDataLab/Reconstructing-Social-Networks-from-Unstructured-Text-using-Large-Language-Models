Dr. Kozminski, a molecular cell biologist, provided scientific background on the field of synthetic biology and brought a scientific perspective to the discussion.  Dr. Arras, a professor in the bioethics department and member of President Obama’s Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, provided insight on ethical and religious groups’ perceptions of synthetic biology.  Professor Bagley of the UVA Law School, shed some light on the legal side of synthetic biology research, especially issues concerning the patenting of genes modified or created using synthetic biology methods.  <A target="_blank" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/5/5d/VGEM_Panel_Program.pdf">Check out our event program to learn more about the panelists</A>. Panelists discussed a range of topics from the environmental release of bacteria to the proper regulation of synthetic biology research.  The conversation also touched on issues such as the labeling of synthetically produced products and the growth of DIY biology.  The first portion of the dialogue was moderated by a member of our team, but the audience was encouraged to join in the dialogue and provide questions for the second portion of the panel.  A reception followed the panel discussion, and attendees had a chance to chat with the panelists one on one, and to view posters submitted by local high schoolers (see below).

Renaissance accepted, and the VGEM team visited the school once a week for six weeks during the fall. This pilot class has now become a regularly offered course at Renaissance School, and students taught by the 2014 VGEM competed at the 2014 High School iGEM competition. The work of the 2013 team inspired this year’s team to continue and expand their collaborative efforts with other schools in the community.</P></DIV><DIV><CENTER><H2>The Math, Engineering and Science Academy (MESA) at Albemarle High SchoolA New Partnership</H2></CENTER><P>We began the summer by reaching out to specialized science programs at public high schools in Albemarle County. We met with Jeff Prillaman, the director of the MESA program, to discuss teaching a synthetic biology crash course similar to our predecessors with his students. He accepted our offer, and we spent the summer preparing a three-day synthetic biology crash course to be presented to students in the program. Team members taught the synthetic biology course over the week of September 8th. The first class consisted of a general overview of basic molecular biology and an introduction to the field of synthetic biology; this curriculum was taught to both juniors (60) and seniors (40) in the MESA program. The second class focused on BioBrick formation and lab work.  Seniors completed a restriction enzyme digest worksheet, loaded, ran and visualized a gel and transformed and plated bacteria containing plasmids with an RFP construct. The third class was split into two mini-lectures on the modeling used in synthetic biology and a discussion of the ethics involved in synthetic biology research. The students were given pre and post-assessments for this crash course.</P></DIV><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><CENTER><I><B>Figure 1.</B> Average points obtained on each question was compared using data from 25 students on pre and post assessments.</I></CENTER></TD><TD id="results" rowspan="3"><CENTER><H2>THE RESULTS</H2></CENTER><P>Figure 1 illustrates an overall improvement in student performance after the three-day course. From Figure 2, we can see that the topic that showed the most improvement was restriction enzymes with a 40% difference between pre and post assessments. Questions on gel electrophoresis also improved with a 33% difference on diagram identification and 32% difference on identification of the laboratory process.  Questions on transformation improved with a 25% difference between pre and post. The improvement on these three question topics corresponds to activities done with students on day two of the course, namely the gel electrophoresis and the transformation of a plasmid into E.coli. Questions that covered topics only reviewed in the lectures showed the least improvement, such as recombinant DNA (6.7% difference) and polymerase chain reaction (2.7% difference). To improve understanding of these topics in a future course, interactive activities will be designed for these topics.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><CENTER><I><B>Figure 2.</B> Percentage difference between pre and post assessment scores on each question of the assessment.</I></CENTER></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><DIV><CENTER><H2>Renaissance SchoolAdvising a New Team</H2></CENTER><P>On October 8, 2014, we visited Renaissance School to give them feedback on their 2014 iGEM project and advise on their new project for the 2015 High School iGEM competition.

Fifty-five teams participated, and twenty-one collected 20 results or more.</P><P>The main purpose of the survey was to explore the general public’s view of synthetic biology on a regional and demographical basis, as well as to examine and compare their views on specific issues, and how semantics affects these views.  We hope that this information can be used by other iGEM teams, professionals in the field of synthetic biology, and policy makers to help determine more precisely where policy and educational efforts regarding synthetic biology should be targeted</P></DIV><DIV id="Questions"><P>Participants were asked to read the following short paragraph, and then rate their feelings towards synthetic biology:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>All living things have genes.  Genes determine how these living things, also known as organisms, look, what they do, and how they function.  In synthetic biology, genes can be taken from one type of organism and put into another.  This allows the modified organism to exhibit traits that it would not exhibit in nature.  For instance, by putting a gene from a firefly into bacteria, you can make the bacteria glow.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><P>They were given a scale from ‘strongly negative’ to ‘strongly positive.’  We then converted the responses to a Likert scale with a maximum value of 5 and a minimum value of 0. Participants were later asked:</P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>Would you drink water that is purified by bacteria if there are no bacteria in the water when you drink it, and the water is shown to be safe?</I></BLOCKQUOTE><P>They were able to select either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ as responses.  This map displays the percentage of ‘yes’ responses, leaving out either blank or ‘no’ responses.  The maximum value is 10, and the minimum value is 0.</P><P> Comparing these maps shows a possible discrepancy between feelings towards synthetic biology in the abstract and applications of synthetic biology.  Feelings toward synthetic biology appear to be, on average, neutral, but, for every region, at least 50% of participants responded that they would drink water cleaned through synthetic biological means, provided assured safety.</P><P>This shows promise that, with increased awareness of potential applications for synthetic biology, views may improve.</P></DIV><CENTER>Figure 1. Comparison of percentage of people who would eat rice genetically modified to produce vitamins and percentage of people who would drink water filtered by bacteria if assured there were no bacteria in the water at the time of consumption.  Bubbles are sized by general opinion towards synthetic biology (based on a Likert scale from ‘strongly negative’ to ‘strongly positive’).</CENTER><P>There seems to be a slight positive correlation between willingness to eat GMO rice and drink bacterially purified water.  However, in all regions, more participants were willing to drink the bacterially purified water than eat the modified rice.  There does not seem to be any relations between feelings towards synthetic biology (shown by the size of the bubbles, larger being more positive feelings) and willingness to consume either the rice or the water.</P><P>In general, the public had positive feelings towards synthetic biology and genetic modification. Throughout the survey, we 

placed questions to see if semantics affected the public’s perception of topics. When asked if they would consume GMOs, 

there were many responses for both ‘yes’ and ‘no.’ However, when asked about eating specific genetically modified organisms 

without the term ‘GMO,’ many more said ‘yes’ than the initial responses would have suggested. This shows that modified 

wording affects feelings towards a topic, and suggests that people may be more supportive of something like GMOs provided 

specific examples.</P><P>We also included a small series of questions to judge potential public perception of our project. These questions were those 

that involved the filtration of water by bacteria. Overall, a majority of people had positive feelings towards this: they felt 

that the benefits outweighed the risks; they would drink water that was filtered by bacteria; and they would have positive 

reactions if they were to learn that it were currently occuring. We also asked about concerns regarding bacterial filtration. 

These responses provide us with valuable insight as to which potential problems with which we should be most concerned 

about addressing.</P><P>Want to know what your region thinks about synthetic biology? Then, look no further!
