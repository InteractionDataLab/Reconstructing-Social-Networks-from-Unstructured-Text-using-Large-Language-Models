Manganese peroxidase is an enzyme from the fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. In this fungus, commonly known as white rot fungus, this enzyme aids in lignin degradation. This enzyme has been shown to degrade nylon 6 and nylon 66. The sequence for MnP in this BioBrick has been codon optimized for E.coli. A pelB secretion tag was also attached to the MnP sequence. It is intended for use by teams that are exploring plastic degradation in their research. Enzymatic activity requires a pH near 4.5 as well as a manganese source such as manganese sulphate. Works best at temperatures near 32 C. Related genes include nylC, nylon hydrolaze, which is also used to degrade nylon plastics.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE border="0"><TBODY><TR><TD id="cspan" colspan="2"><H3>Part: BBa_K1357002</H3><H4>NhaR Transcriptional Regulator</H4></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>NhaR acts as a transcriptional activator in E. coli.

The sequence for MnP in this BioBrick has been codon optimized for E.coli. A pelB secretion tag was also attached to the MnP sequence. The BioBrick also contains a constitutive promoter, a ribosome binding site and a terminator. This BioBrick allows E.coli to secrete manganese peroxidase into the surrounding environment.
