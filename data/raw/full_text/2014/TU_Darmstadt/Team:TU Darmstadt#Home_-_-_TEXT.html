Welcome to TU Darmstadt's iGEM Wiki 2014
We dedicated the this year's project to find a new approach to produce Anthocyanins E.coli.
Anthocyanins are plants pigments, which not only stains blossoms in blue, violet or red but also is enclosed in fruits and is valued for its antioxidant effect as well as the ability to lower the risks for cancer.
In our technological approach, anthocyanin dye is utilised to construct “Grätzel cells”. These electrochemical dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs) use the produced dye, instead of a silica semiconductor material, for the absorption of light. The objective was to investigate an innovative approach for a sustainable energy source - wherever and whenever needed.
