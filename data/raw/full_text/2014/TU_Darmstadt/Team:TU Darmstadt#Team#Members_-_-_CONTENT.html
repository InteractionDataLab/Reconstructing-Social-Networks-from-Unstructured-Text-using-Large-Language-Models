Biomolecular Engineering</P><P>Hi! This is my first time at the iGEM team. I participate because I want to make some practical lab experience beside the normal labrotaries. Also I like the idea of working in a project so interdisciplinary as this. You can share your ideas with people from other backgrounds and include their point of view into your project.I hope for new impressions in the field of synthetic biology and I'm courius about a good time in the lab.</P></LI><LI><B>Sebastian Barthel</B><P>Age: 22 </P><P>Subject: B. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering</P><P>During my first semester at university, I have been in contact with the former iGEM team 2012 for the first time. Since then, I was keen to work on such a interesting project like the digestion of PET by E.coli. Unfortunately I had to learn some biological basics first, so I could not help our team in 2013. But now I am even more excited to compete with our anthocyanin project this year.</P><P>I anticipate from the iGEM project to deepen my previously obtained knowledge by working independently in the laboratory and to improve my softskills and expertise. The possibilities to take positive influence on manhood's future life by using synthetic biology are enormous. I am glad to promote improvement in the field of synthetic biology by being a member of our team and by being part of this year's competition. </P></LI><LI><B>Malte Blumenroth</B><P>Age: 24</P><P>Studies: M.Sc. Molecular Engineering</P><P>It's my second time to participate as part of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team after 2012.</P><P>I like the innovative nature of the competition that offers ways to improve my skills and learn about synthetic biology outside of university courses. Also I expect to get further practical experience working for a more independent project and have a good time at the lab.</P></LI><LI><B>Thomas Dohmen</B><P>Age: 24</P><P>Study: B.Sc. biology</P><P>After hearing a lot about the last iGEM projects at the TU Darmstadt, I absolutely wanted to join. I like the idea of working in a research group for which iGEM offers the first opportunity.</P><P>I am looking forward to gain practical experience, especially since one normally does not get the chance to do so during the regular study.</P><P>To meet other people, to exchange ideas and get in contact with economy, thats the spirit of iGEM.</P><P>Because of that, I am really excited to participate on this years iGEM competition and I am also really looking forward to see you guys on the Giant Jamboree in Boston!</P></LI><LI><B>Maximilian Dombrowsky</B><P>Age: 23</P><P>Study: B.Sc.
