Welcome to TU Darmstadt's iGEM Wiki 2014
We dedicated this year's project to find a new approach to produce Anthocyanidins in E.coli. Anthocyanidins are the glycosylated forms of anthocyanins.
Anthocyanins are plant pigments, which not only stain blossoms in blue, violet or red but also are enclosed in fruits and are valued for their antioxidant effect as well as the ability to lower the risk of cancer.
In our technological approach, anthocyanin dye is utilised to construct “Grätzel cells”. These electrochemical dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs) use the produced dye instead of a silica semiconductor material for the absorption of light. The objective was to investigate an innovative approach for a sustainable energy source - wherever and whenever needed.
