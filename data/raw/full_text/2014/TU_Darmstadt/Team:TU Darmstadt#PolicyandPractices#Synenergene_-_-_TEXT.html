Synenergene is a four-years mobilization and mutual learning action plan (MMLAP) supported by the European Commission. The project aims to contribute to Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in the field synthetic biology by establishing an open dialogue between stakeholders concerning SynBio’s potential benefits and risks, and by exploring possibilities for its collaborative shaping on the basis of public participation.
Synenergene supports iGEM teams in their Policy & Practices efforts. We can tell proudly that we’ve been chosen as one of only eight teams who got the opportunity to take their Policy & Practices project to the next level.
During the summer we met with several experts on Grätzel cells and shaped our view of possible applications . Subsequently we developed a techno-morale vignette , that tells the story of Amadaou, a Senegalese groundnut farmer.
Our collaboration with different Synenergene partners, especially the Athena Institute in Amsterdam, helped us greatly in developing a realistic vision of our project, that involves various stakeholders. We encourage every iGEM team to try this new and exciting Policy & Practices approach!
