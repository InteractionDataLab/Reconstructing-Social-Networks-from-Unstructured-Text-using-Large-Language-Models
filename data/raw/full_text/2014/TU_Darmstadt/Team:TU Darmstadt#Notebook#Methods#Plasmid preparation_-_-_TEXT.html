Plasmid Preparation
For Plasmid preparation we used PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System by Promega.
Short explanation:
The PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System Kit from Promega is a fast way to purificate plasmid DNA out of a bacteria culture.
Procedure:
Preparations were accomplished according to the " Quick Protocol" of the PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System by Promega.
