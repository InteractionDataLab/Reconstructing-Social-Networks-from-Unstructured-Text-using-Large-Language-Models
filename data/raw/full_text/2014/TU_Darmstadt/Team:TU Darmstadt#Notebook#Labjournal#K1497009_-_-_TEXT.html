Part: K1497009 Flavonon-3beta-hydroxylase
This parts encodes the sequence for the enzyme Flavonon-3beta-hydroxylase (F3H; EC 1.2.7.3) from Petroselinum crispum. F3H catalyze naringenin, an anthocyanidin precursor, to the substance dihydroflavonol (Tanaka, 2006). We received the Flavonon-3beta-hydroxylase from Dr. Stefan Martens in a pYES2 shuttle vector. Before the part was useable, we used a QuikChange Site-directed Kit from Stratagene to eliminate the EcoRI and PstI -sites. The used primers for the QuikChange:
F3H_mut_EcoRI_fwd_820_F, F3H_mut_EcoRI_fwd_820_R 
F3H_mut_PstI_fwd_1047_F, F3H_mut_PstI_fwd_1047_R
