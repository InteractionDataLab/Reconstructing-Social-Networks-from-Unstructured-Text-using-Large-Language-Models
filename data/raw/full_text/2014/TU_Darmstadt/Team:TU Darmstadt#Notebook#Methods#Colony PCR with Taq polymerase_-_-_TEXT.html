Colony PCR with Taq Polymerase
Equipment:
- PCR machine
Chemicals & consumables:
- Sterile Eppendorf Tubes
- LB-agar plate with appropriate antibiotic
- Primers (usually VF2 and VR)
- Sterile pipet tips
Mixtures: 1x Reaction Mixture (25 µL)
- 12,5 µL 2x Taq MM
- 0,5 µL VF2 (10 µM)
- 0,5 µL VR (10 µM)
- 1 µL of colony suspension
- ddH2O to 25 µL
Procedure:
The colony PCR is a modified PCR programm employed to verifiy transformation success by amplifiying the insert or the vector construct used for transformation. This is necessary due to the fact, that a transformation with the empty vector may lead to antibiotic resistance.
- Pick one colony with a sterile tip and suspend in 10 µL of ddH2O.
- Inoculate tip with colony into tube. Pipet up and down to ensure all cells are transferred to tube.
Start the PCR using the following programm with 1x mix and run a gel to determine the PCR product length (don't forget the positive control).
