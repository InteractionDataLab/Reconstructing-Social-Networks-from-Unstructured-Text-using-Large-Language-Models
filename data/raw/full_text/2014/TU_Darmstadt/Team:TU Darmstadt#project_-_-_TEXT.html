Welcome to the TU Darmstadt iGEM Team Wiki-Pages 2014
 We dedicated the this year's project to find a new approach to produce Anthocyanines, a class of plant pigments, in Escherichia coli (E. coli).
 Anthocyanine not only stains blossoms in blue, violet or red but also is enclosed in fruits and is valued for its antioxidant effect as well as the ability to lower the risks for cancer.
 In the our technological approach, the anthocyanin dye is utilised to build a so-called “Grätzel cells”. This electrochemical dye-sensitised solar cell use the produced dye instead of a silica semiconductor material for the absorption of light. The objective was to investigate an innovative approach for a sustainable energy source; wherever and whenever needed.
