Flavonon-3beta-hydroxylase with strong RBS (B0034-F3H)
This part encodes the sequence for the enzyme Flavonon-3beta-hydroxylase (F3H; EC 1.2.7.3) from Petroselinum crispum with a strong ribosome binding site. To get a functional enzyme, we integrated a strong ribosomal binding site (RBS; B0034). For the RBS integration we used the K1497009 as template for a PCR with the following primers :
F3H_RBS_Prefix and F3H_Suffix.
With gelelectrophoresis and sequencing we verified that we produced the BioBrick BBa_K1497012 .
