Age: 21
Studies: B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
Hi! This is my first time at the iGEM team. I participate because I want to make some practical lab experience beside the normal labrotaries. Also I like the idea of working in a project so interdisciplinary as this. You can share your ideas with people from other backgrounds and include their point of view into your project.I hope for new impressions in the field of synthetic biology and I'm courius about a good time in the lab.
Sebastian Barthel
Age: 22 
Subject: B. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
During my first semester at university, I have been in contact with the former iGEM team 2012 for the first time. Since then, I was keen to work on such a interesting project like the digestion of PET by E.coli. Unfortunately I had to learn some biological basics first, so I could not help our team in 2013. But now I am even more excited to compete with our anthocyanin project this year.
I anticipate from the iGEM project to deepen my previously obtained knowledge by working independently in the laboratory and to improve my softskills and expertise. The possibilities to take positive influence on manhood's future life by using synthetic biology are enormous. I am glad to promote improvement in the field of synthetic biology by being a member of our team and by being part of this year's competition.

It's my second time to participate as part of the TU Darmstadt iGEM team after 2012.
I like the innovative nature of the competition that offers ways to improve my skills and learn about synthetic biology outside of university courses. Also I expect to get further practical experience working for a more independent project and have a good time at the lab.
Thomas Dohmen
Age: 24
Study: B.Sc. biology
After hearing a lot about the last iGEM projects at the TU Darmstadt, I absolutely wanted to join. I like the idea of working in a research group for which iGEM offers the first opportunity.
I am looking forward to gain practical experience, especially since one normally does not get the chance to do so during the regular study.
To meet other people, to exchange ideas and get in contact with economy, thats the spirit of iGEM.
Because of that, I am really excited to participate on this years iGEM competition and I am also really looking forward to see you guys on the Giant Jamboree in Boston!

During by bachelor studies I already heard about the creative iGEM projects of the TU Darmstadt. Therefore, I am pleased to join the iGEM competition for the first time in 2014 during my master studies. I am fascinated by the iGEM projects due to the teamwork with highly motivated and creative fellow students that meet die challenge to realize a science project independently. Additionally, the broad range of tasks of the iGEM project always leads to the opportunity to acquire new knowledge and to deepen already existing skills.

Benjamin Mayer
Age: 26
Studies: B.Sc. computer science, M.Sc. physics
Hi, my name is Benjamin Mayer, I am currently studying at the TU Darmstadt for my bachelor's degree in computer science and my master's degree in physics.
I initially learned about iGEM during my bachelor thesis at the Computational Biology and Simulation group.
As physicist and computer scientist I am equipped with a relatively broad theoretical knowledge from which I want to contribute to the Team, e.g., in the field of modeling.For me personally iGEM is a chance to work with a large Team, in comparison to the group sizes common for my field of study, on an interesting and multidisciplinary subject. Thus, through iGEM I can broaden my scope of knowledge and learn new team competences.
Christian Mende
Age: 26
Study: B.Sc. Biotechnology
I pay attention on iGEM because of a documantation of syntetic biology which aroused my interest.The more I informed me, the more I wanted to take a part of it.By chance I met the right person and I could not miss this opportunity.Now i am glad to transform the theory of lectures into practice to collect important experiences 
Laurin Monnheimer
Age:24
Study: B.Sc. Biology
Participating  iGEM the second time i've get once more the bargain being part of this project.
The contest offers the unique opportunity to carry out research in a practically oriented manner and to meet scientific challenges as a team. Therefore, iGEM presents an outstanding occasion to gain new valuable experiences and to further develop my personal and scientific skills.  
I hope that we as a project team will be successful in finding solid solutions to the problems we will be confronted with and I am highly motivated to make my personal contribution to iGEM.

I took part in the first iGEM participation of the TU Darmstadt two years ago and I am looking forward to another challenging year of participating in the competition. I like working with students from multiple disciplines and the freedom and opportunity to try out diverse ideas in the lab. The fascinating projects that are performed every year give an impression of how much knowledge a student can gain by competing at iGEM. I specialized on computational biology during my bachelor studies and I am looking forward to employing those skills for my team.

This is my third time in the iGEM team but nevertheless I'm still excited like I was in the first year. Contrary to regular modules iGEM gives you th opportunity to deepen your knowledge in themes aside my study program. I hope for a good colaboration in the team and a great time in the lab.  
Fabian Rohden
Age: 23
Studies: B.Sc. Biology
Hello! My name is Fabian Rohden and I study Biology in the fifth semester.I heard about iGEM from some Biomoleculer Engineering students and really liked the idea of working on an interesting project in addition to the normal university studies. Through iGEM I hope to learn a lot about synthetic biology but also about the organization of science projects. 
Daniel Sachs
Age: 25
Study: M. Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
It’s already the third iGEM competition for me and since it may be the last (as a student), I’m already a bit melancholic. Nevertheless the upcoming “Giant Jamboree” in Boston motivates me even more to put as much effort as possible in our project to make it the best TU Darmstadt iGEM ever!
Renè Sahm
Age: 24
Study: M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering, 2. semester
In 2012 I were already of the party with our first participation in the iGEM-competition. It was an unique experience and I had a lot of fun at that time. After my pause in the competition last year, I am now ready to lend a hand again. Until now I've passed my B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering at the TU Darmstadt and started my master's degree with a specialization in structural biology. So I hope I'll be able to support my team optimally and to contribute it with some useful results in bioinformatics. Like the last time I am looking forward to the competition and the other participant student-teams. In particular, I am very curious because of the speciality that the whole competition will proceed at the MIT this year.
Christian Sator
Age: 26
Studies: M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
I joined this year’s iGEM-team because I like the idea of tackling a complex issue together with a team and work out solutions for it. I think iGEM is a great opportunity to experience independent and interdisciplinary research and to broaden one’s mind. I’m looking forward to learn new stuff and meet lots of interesting people.
