Dichloromethane Extraction
Materials: 
- Dichloromethane
- 37% hydrochloric acid
- Centrifuge
- Tubes
Procedure:
- Spin down the bacterial solution at 4500g for 10 minutes.
- Remove culture media, weigh the remaining pellet, add the same amount of dichloromethane and vortex for 5 minutes. Separate supernatant and pellet and acetify each with about 300µl of 37% hydrochloric acid till the color turns to red. 
- Spin down the resolved pellet at 13,3g for 10 minutes and Remove supernatant.
The anthocyanidin is present in the organic and the aqueous phase; the color can be changed by adjusting the pH-value.
