DNA Quantification With NanoDrop
Equipment:
- Micropipettes with sterile tips
- Nanodrop
Chemicals & consumables: 
- DNA probe
- nuclease free H2O
Procedure:
1. Start the programme for the NanoDrop and click on "Nucleic Acids"
2. Pipette 1 µL of a water sample onto the measuring surface and click “OK” for initialising
3. Load your blank and click "Blank"
4. Load your DNA samples and click "Measure"
The system calculate automatically the 260/280 value and the 260/230 value.
