K1497013 - Dihydroflavonol 4-reductase with strong RBS (B0034)
After we created BBa_K1497010, a ribosom binding site had to be added to come a step further for creating a functioning expression system. For this purpose, we used BBa_K1497010 as a template for PCR with RBS primers (Prefix_RBS_DFR-primer and DFR_Suffix-primer). The PCR product was then restricted with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and PstI and ligated into an equaly restricted pSB1C3 vector to create the biobrick BBa_K1497013. 
Figure 1: gel electrophoresis of DFR in pSB1C3 digested and undigested: 1st lane contains undigested RBS_DFR in pSB1C3 (green box), 2nd lane contains RBS_DFR digested with Pst1 and EcoR1 (red box)
