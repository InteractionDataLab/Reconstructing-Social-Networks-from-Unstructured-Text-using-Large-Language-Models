The IGEM TEC CEM team has witnessed the effort during almost one and a half years since its foundation on July, 2013. Throughout all this time, until the delivery of results on October 17th; the 11 members that constitute this team, as well as the instructors and advisors, have shown the commitment and dedication possible towards the accomplishment of the main goal: medical bioremediation and a possible treatment for atherosclerosis. The work in the laboratory, institutional support and evaluation of the results would not have been possible without the following organizations and individuals dedicated to share their knowledge and support to the team:
•  Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey Campus Estado de México (ITESM-CEM).
•  Department of Biotechnology Engineering and Chemical Engineering - ITESM CEM
•  School of Design, Engineering and Architecture (EDIA) - ITESM CEM.
