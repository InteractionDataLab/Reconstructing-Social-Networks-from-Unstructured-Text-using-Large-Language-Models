A total of 12 persons, from different areas and backgrounds were selected to take a part in this project. Team captain Carlos Meza organized meetings with all the members in order to explaining what iGEM was and the theoretical bases of the competition.</P><GOTOP><A href="#top">Back to top ↑</A></GOTOP><A name="Aug13"><H4>August 2013</H4></A><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Brainstorming. Each team member shared different propositions for the project, with different approaches to a variety of subjects. Afterwards, individually or in pairs, several ideas were explored more thoroughly, with the intention to consolidate the theorical basis, experimental development and applications. All of this was done taking the igem requirements into account.</P><GOTOP><A href="#top">Back to top ↑</A></GOTOP><A name="Sep13"><H4>September 2013</H4></A><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">We approached several members of the faculty here at Tec CEM, to see if they wanted to be our advisors, based on the needs of the different projects.

During this session, said advisors helped us choose by making remarks regarding the experimental development, viability, and potential applications for every project. At the end, 3 candidates were selected for further examination, in order to ensure that the project was an adequate proposal for a competition of this caliber.</LI><LI><B>December 15.</B>A second meeting was scheduled in order to make the final decision. Voting was done to choose the best project. Lipofuscine degradation was the chosen one. *Dramatic music* During the holiday break, we all had to do research in order to come back in January with all set up for the project.</LI></UL><GOTOP><A href="#top">Back to top ↑</A></GOTOP><H2>2014</H2><A name="Jan14"><H4>January 2014</H4></A><P>After thorough considerations during the holiday break, it was deemed that the project would have better viability with cholesterol degradation instead of  lipofuscine degradation.

•   Cryopreservation and extraction of B0017 and B0015 parts.
•   Digestion of B0015 part.
•   Successful PCR of F1Ori (25 µl) achieved with NEB® PCR Supermix.
•   Successful PCR of CMV (25 µl) achieved with NEB® PCR Supermix.
•   Digestions of B0017 and B0015.
•   During this week we also tried a new protocol for the transformation of pPROEX plasmids in dH5α by thermal shock. We also started to work with cholesterol oxidase and oxidoreductase, two of the three enzymes we’re going to assembly for the final part of the project by a previous transformation of PUC57 in dH5α by thermal shock as well; both transformations were positive. After the incubation, the isolated colonies of the transformations in dH5α, were again inoculated in LB petri dishes with ampicillin 35 mg/ml. We also applied the digestion-ligation protocol to prove the biobrick was present in the transformed plasmids. 
</LI><LI><B>Week 2. </B>•	Successful PCRs of BGHPA (3*50 µl) achieved with NEB® PCR Supermix.
•   Successful PCR of F1Ori (3*50 µl) and CMV (3*50 µl) achieved with NEB® PCR Supermix.
•   Purification of the PCR products F1Ori and BGHPA with Phenol-Chloroform.
•   Successful PCRs of NeoR (3*50 µl) achieved with NEB® PCR Supermix.
•   We verified in an electrophoresis that the various PCRs have been amplifying successfully except NeoR, which has some unspecific amplifications, the annealing temperature will be raised from 62ºC to 62.5ºC.
•   The purifications with Phenol-Chloroform show a dim line in the electrophoresis, we suspect of an ill stored Phenol-Chloroform (ambient tº and it shows a pink color).
•   After the growth of the isolated colonies in the petri dishes, we inoculated them in liquid LB with ampicillin for a further plasmid extraction of cholesterol oxidase, oxidoreductase and pPROEX; in which we tried a different time of incubation and time for the denaturalization of the lysozyme to prevent the appearance of genomic DNA. We also transformed dehydratase, the third enzyme, in dH5α by thermal shock, which then was subjected to plasmid extraction under the standards of the modified protocol. 
</LI><LI><B>Week 3. </B>•	Successful PCRs of NeoR (3*50 µl) achieved with NEB® PCR Supermix, this time a unique band appeared in the electrophoresis.
•   A new Phenol-Chloroform was prepares and stored correctly (refrigerated and inside an opaque glass container).
•   Purification of F1Ori, BGHPA and CMV PCRs with Phenol-Chloroform.
•   We wanted to do the first digestion and ligation of our bioparts, nevertheless the Phenol-Chloroform extractions weren’t satisfactory so we’ll have to wait and learn another technique to purify PCR products.
•   A purification of the BGHPA PCR product was made with ethanol and we helped the other groups in our team.
•   During this week, we tried a ligation with K823005 and E0240 in PSB1C3. We inoculated on a dish plate, and then isolated twelve colonies to identify the different possibilities of ligation of each biocrick; then were ran an electrophoresis to prove their right ligation. Only one out of the twelve colonies was correctly ligated. 
We also inoculated dehydratase, oxoacylreducatse and cholesterol oxidase in 50 ml of liquid LB with ampicillin 35 mg/ml for a further plasmid extraction and expression in an alternative plasmid. 

</LI><LI><B>Week 4.  </B>•	The purification of BGHPA was satisfactory, so we proceeded to digest with EcoRI and SpeI.
•   We kept on helping the other groups in our team preparing various Cam+ mediums. 
•   Further attempts at purifying PCR products with ethanol were not successful. So we decided to keep on helping our partners until we learn a new purification protocol from our tutor. 
•   Purifications of NeoR, CMV, BGHPA and F1Ori were made with a new protocol.</LI></UL><GOTOP><A href="#top">Back to top ↑</A></GOTOP><A name="Sep14"><H4>September 2014</H4></A><P>Project in sight! and Viva México!</P><UL><LI><B>Week 1 </B>•   During these days, and after the assurance of the correct enzyme ligations with the vector, we ligated each enzyme with B0034, a RBS that would be useful for a further expression in animal cells. These enzymes are going to be overexpressed and purified.
•   We ran an electrophoresis to make sure are PCR purifications weren't contaminated and we confirmed they weren't.
•   We digested the 4 bioparts with EcoRI and SpeI.
•   We did a ligation of the bioparts.
•   Transformations of the ligations of BGHPA and F1Ori.
•   Ligation of CMV with J04450.

•   Ligations of BGHPA and F1Ori with J00450.
•   New transformations of the BGHPA and f1ori ligations were made since they haven’t been successful.
•   Colonies of the transformation of PproexB were cultured in new dishes and essay tubes.
•   An essay tube with the CMV ligation showed growth so it was cultured in Cam+ dishes.
•   The Cam+ dishes with CMV showed a pink colored growth when we were expecting white cultures, new dishes were cultured from the original essay tube.
•   We helped our companions in extractions and digestions of other bioparts.
</LI><LI><B>Week 2 </B>•   We kept on helping our companions with digestions and ligations.
•   In the morning our CMV culture finally showed the expected white color in a culture, so we proceeded to grow a new dish from this culture.
•   We prepared multiple essay tubes with Amp+ and Cam+ and petri dishes with Cam+ for the growth of cells transformed by `both us and our companions.
•   At night the CMV culture had grown so we cultured it in 50ml of LB/Cam+.
•   We also cultured at night 1ml of PproexB in 50ml of LB/Amp+.
•   The CMV+J00450 plasmid was extracted and digested in order to verify it, it showed an unexpected pattern in its bands, another enzyme will be used for its verification.
•   A ligation of BGHPA+J00450 was made.
•   The ligation of F1Ori+J00450 will have to wait since all the PstI enzyme we need in order to digest J00450 has all been used, we’ll need to acquire more enzyme.
•   We still haven’t acquired PstI so our advance is halted by this inconvenient.
•   We transformed cells with the BGHPA+J00450 ligation.
•   The BGHPA+J00450 transformed cultures showed a white coloration (at least three different cultures).
•   We were able to digest J00450 with PstI in buffer 3.1.

For each enzyme we made a growth curve starting from inoculation at time zero, and ending six hours after the induction with IPTG (right after the optical density was between 0.5-0.6). We took samples each hour from the time zero to the end of the curve. Those samples were prepared with Laemmli buffer for a further analysis by SDS-PAGE to identify the protein and to see the overexpression of the same, the phase where the protein was accumulating (soluble phase or inclusion bodies) and the isolation of the sample for purification by affinity chromatography. NeoR, CMV, and BGHPA characterization. Our enzyme substrates where delivered out of time so we couldn't characterize them.
