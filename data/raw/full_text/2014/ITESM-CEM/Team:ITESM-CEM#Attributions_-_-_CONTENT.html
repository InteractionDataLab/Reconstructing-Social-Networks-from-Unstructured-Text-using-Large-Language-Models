Throughout all this time, until the delivery of results on October 17th; the 11 members that constitute this team, as well as the instructors and advisors, have shown the commitment and dedication possible towards the accomplishment of the main goal: medical bioremediation and a possible treatment for atherosclerosis. The work in the laboratory, institutional support and evaluation of the results would not have been possible without the following organizations and individuals dedicated to share their knowledge and support to the team:</P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
