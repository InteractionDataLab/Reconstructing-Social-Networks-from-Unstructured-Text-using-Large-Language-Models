Shown with arrows.) This shows that the enzyme was correctly inserted into the plasmid.</P><H2>CMV, F1 origin of replication and BHGPA characterization<P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Once a construction which included the biobricks CMV promoter, and BGHPA polyadenylation signal was built, using GFP (BBa_E0240) as a marker of gene expression; the plasmid was transfected into monkey kidney cells (MARC-145 cell line) using the protocol previously described (see Materials and Methods) in order to assess its functionality in an eukaryotic environment. A photograph of the cells before transfection, taken with an inverted phase microscope, is shown in figure 1.</P><P><PIE><B>Figure 1.</B> MARC-145 cells before transfection as seen with an inverted phase microscope. </PIE></P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Another photograph was taken using the inverted phase microscope 48 hours after transfection. Two control experiments were run: one without lipofectamine, and another one with lipofectamine and no plasmid. Figure 2 shows a comparison between both controls and the experiment. Cell growth exists for all samples because Geneticin selection cannot yet be measured.</P><P><PIE><B>Figure 2.</B> From left to right, control cells treated with no lipofectamine, control cells treated with lipofectamine and no plasmid and cells exposed to lipofectamine and plasmid. Photographs were taken using an inverted phase microscope. Cell growth is seen for all the experiments. </PIE></P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Since cell growth exists for all cultures, the experiment was treated with UV light at 395nm in order to asses for fluorescence, which would be a proof of gene expression. The results of this analysis are shown in figure 3, where fluorescence can be seen. However, it can be easily seen that transfection efficiency is not as high as predicted.</P><P><PIE><B>Figure 3.</B> Lipofected cells containing the GFP-expressing device exposed to UV radiation. Lipofection efficiency is low but construction funtionality is proven by the fluorescence observed. </PIE></P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Because gene expression exists, as seen in figure 3, we can correctly infer that both biobricks: CMV promoter, and BGHPA polyadenylation signal are properly working. If this was not the case, transcription would either not be possible or be unable to cease, because of a lack of termination signals. The existence of fluorescence reveals the presence of a functional GFP protein, which in turn proves that both bioparts are functional.</P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Finally, figure 4 shows the results for transfection of a construction including CMV promoter, BGHPA, and one of the enzymes cloned by the team (7-dehidratase). However, due to a lack of time, characterization of gene expression for this construction was not performed.</P><P><PIE><B>Figure 4.</B> Lipofected cells containing the 7-dehydratase expressing plasmid construction as seen after transfection. </PIE></P><GOTOP><A href="#top">Back to top ↑</A></GOTOP></H2><H2>Recombinant Protein Expression</H2><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The samples were loaded in a 15% acrylamide gel, using Precision Plus Protein TM Dual Color Standards, for 20 minutes/90 V for the stacking gel and 60 minutes/150V for the resolving gel. The results are now presented:</P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Only the samples shown in the image before were the ones that presented notable bands that represent our protein of interest. As expected, the most remarked band is the one of the time 3, which means that inductions was taken correctly and more protein was produced, in other words, the protein was overexpressing. The band marked with the arrow represents a protein that weights approximately 34 kDa, which corresponds to the molecular weight of oxoacyl reductase according to ExPASy’s Compute pI/MW tool.</P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">7-dehydratase was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 15% acrylamide gel using Precision Plus Protein TM Unstained Standards, for 20 minutes/90 V for the stacking gel and 90 minutes/110V for the resolving gel. Four samples were taken, including one before and after induction with IPTG, one from the soluble phase and one from the inclusion bodies; all prepared with Laemmli buffer. The results are shown in the image below.</P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">No analysis of solubility was realized due to the quantity of protein. It was supposed to be done exactly the same than oxoacyl reductase, as the protein was found in a notable way in the inclusion bodies as shown in the lane 5.</P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">For both enzymes no further work was done. After the identification of each of them, and after the analysis of solubility, the proteins have to be purified by affinity chromatography with a Invitrogen Ni-NTA Agarose column, taking the advantage of the histidine tag added to the protein. After the purification, enzymatic parameters would be determined by the interaction of the enzymes with the substrate; 7β-Hydroxycholesterol for cholesterol oxidase, and 5-Cholesten-3β-ol-7-one for 7-dehydratase and oxoacyl reductase. </P><GOTOP><A href="#top">Back to top ↑</A></GOTOP><A name="Five"><H2>NeoR Results</H2></A><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> Results obtained from experimentation.

Any concentration below this point showed colonies in forms of clusters which were sometimes impossible to quantify and therefore it could be the cause of experimental difficulties to obtain isolated colonies.</P><GOTOP><A href="#top">Back to top ↑</A></GOTOP><A name="Six"><H2>Enzymes</H2></A><H4>BBa_K1313000</H4><P><PIE><B>Figure 1.</B> Growth of isolated white colony showing a successful transformation with cholesterol oxidase enzyme in LB plate with chloramphenicol (35 mg/ul).</PIE></P><P><PIE><B>Figure 2.</B>Gel electrophoresis 0.8% agarose.

This ligation was further transformed into E. coli DH5α and grown both on LB plates, and liquid LB media with 1% v/v of antibiotic (35 ug/ml). 
A photo of the colonies obtained after replatting the bacteria is shown. This is a valid proof of construction structure, since oxoacyl was previously contained in an ampicillin resistance-containing plasmid and colonies are white. This can only be explained by a functional chloramphenicol resistance (provided by psB1C3 plasmid), and an insertion that occurred in the middle of the RFP-coding region of the backbone. </P><H4>BBa_K1313002</H4><P><PIE><B>Figure 1.</B> Growth of white colonies of 7-dehydratase enzyme in psB1C3; LB plate with cloramphenicol (35 ug/ml). </PIE></P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The ligation of 7-dehydratase was made with J04450 (psB1C3 with RFP protein). The BB_J04450 by itself, produces red colonies and grows in the antibiotic Cloramphenicol. After the ligation and transformation, only the white colonies were selected. 7-dehydratase was previously in pUC57 (Ampicillin Resistance),  this gives us more certainty that the white colony is in fact, the correct ligation of 7-dehydratase in pSB1C3, otherwise, colonies wouldn’t have grown due to cloramphenicol, or red colonies would have been seen.</P><P><PIE><B>Figure 2.</B>Gel electrophoresis 0.8% agarose. 7-Dehydratase in pSB1C3 extraction.

</PIE></P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Comparing the restriction in silico analysis of 7- dehydratase in pSB1C3 (Figure 3) with the electrophoresis gel shown in Figure 4, the three expected bands (1650 bp, 1000 bp, 250 bp. Shown with arrows.) were obtained. An additional band of approximately 3500 bp is seen at the top of the gel, this band corresponds to undigested plasmid. This shows that less plasmid has to be digested and less sample has to be loaded.</P><GOTOP><A href="#top">Back to top ↑</A></GOTOP><H4>BBa_K1313003</H4><P><PIE><B>Figure 1.</B> Growth of red and white colonies of B0034 + Oxoacyl-reductase ligation in pSB1C3; LB plate with cloramphenicol (35 ug/ml).</PIE></P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The ligation of this enzyme and the RBS B0034 was in J00450, which has the RFP protein encoded.

</PIE></P><P style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Results observed in Lane 2 are consistent with the expected ones, given that the band is of approximately 3000 bp and the expected one was of 3030. At the same time, lane 3 shows expected results from the in silico digestion. However, the 997 bp band is too thin to observe, the team believes this is due to low concentration of digested plasmid. However, the 2033 band can be clearly identified. These results were the beginning of the expected mammalian expression plasmid construction, however due to time issues, we were not able to ligate other Biobricks necessary.</P><GOTOP><A href="#top">Back to top ↑</A></GOTOP></DIV></TABLE><P> </P><DIV class="printfooter">
