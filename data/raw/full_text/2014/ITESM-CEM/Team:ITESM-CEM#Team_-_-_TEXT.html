The Team Team Members Our School and Lab
iGEM ITESM-CEM Team
We are the first generation of iGEMers at the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Estado de México Campus. We are 11 Mexican Biotechnology Engineering students, three instructors and one advisor. Our team was founded on July 24th, 2013. Since the beginning, we have been researching information regarding Synthetic Biology and how it works. Together we agreed that working on a Synthetic Biology Project that pretends to create a new metabolic pathway able to degrade a cholesterol derivative, 7-ketocholesterol, would be an innovative project not only for iGEM competition, but also for investigation lines in our University. We are happy to be part of the 10th iGEM Collegiate Anniversary competition. Don't lose track of us!
