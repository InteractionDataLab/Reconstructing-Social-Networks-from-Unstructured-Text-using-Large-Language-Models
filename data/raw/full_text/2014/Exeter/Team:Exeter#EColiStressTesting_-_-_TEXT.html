The Toxicity of TNT and Nitroglycerin to E. coli
Aim
Trinitrotoluene and nitroglycerin are known to have toxic properties. In order to asses the efficacy of our constructs to either degrade these compounds or detect them we need to know their effect on E. coli. This page describes our findings with regards to the effects of TNT and NG on TOP10 E. coli cells.
We found out the concentrations of each chemical that inhibited growth in E. coli. These concentrations were between 0.326 mM and 0.364 mM for TNT, with complete inhibition occurring above 0.400 mM, and between 0.086 mM and 0.169 mM for NG, with complete inhibition occurring above 0.169 mM.
Introduction
Trinitrotoluene and nitroglycerin are known to be toxic to a wide range of organisms, including bacteria. Before commencing any work with engineered E. coli, we first had to know out how the E. coli strain we are using (TOP10) would respond to the addition of TNT or NG to the media.
To test this we monitored growth of E. coli following addition of a known concentration of TNT or NG. These experiments were performed in a 96-well plate, allowing us to increase the range of concentrations of compounds we were able to test. Moreover, TNT and NG are only available in small quantities, and the smaller culture volumes allowed this to go further.
The following questions were asked:
What concentration of TNT or NG prevents growth of E. coli in a new cell culture?
What concentration of TNT or NG is lethal to an established cell culture?
