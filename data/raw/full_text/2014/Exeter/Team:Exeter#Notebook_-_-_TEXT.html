The Notebook
Welcome to the Exeter iGEM team notebook! Here we have recorded our progress throughout the summer, allowing a precise tracking of our experimental method and progress. This includes all aspects of our project including planning, experimental method, results and discussion. You can view our lab book , or take a more in-depth look at the protocols we used in our experiments.
