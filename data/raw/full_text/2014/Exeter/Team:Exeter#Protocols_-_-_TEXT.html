LB Media
Used to grow overnight cultures of E. coli.
The recipe for 1l LB media is as follows:
Tryptone
15g
Yeast Extract
10g
NaCl                       
5g
Once these components have been added ddH2O should be used to bring the solution to 1l, followed by autoclaving.
MYE Media
MYE is a modified minimal media used to grow bacteria in the 96-well plates. MYE was used here as LB has a natural fluorescence that would interfere with our readings. It was created by Howard et al. (2013) and was modified from Schirmer et al. (2010).
The recipe for 1l MYE media is as follows:
Na2HPO4
6g
KH2PO4
3g
NaCl
0.5g
NH4Cl
2g
Tris.HCL (pH 7.25) (1M Solution)      
200ml
Yeast Extract

Autoclave the solution, then added a volume of (previously sterilised) stock solution:
CaCl2
11mg/l
100ul
MgSO4.7H2O
0.25g/l
1000ul
FeCl3.6H2O
27mg/l
100ul
ZnCl.4H2O

Using the TECAN Plate Reader
The TECAN Infinite 200 Pro is a multimode plate reader with a range of detection modes and functions. It was primarily used when study E. coli and the effects of our constructs in vivo. We created a method (using the accompanying software) that allowed us to scan the fluorescence and optical density of our samples. The machine also had temperature control, allowing us to keep our samples at 37 °C when they were being scanned, as well as some degree of shaking control.
By using a 96-well plate reader we were able to massively increase the range of our experiments. Ordinarily we would’ve had to have used larger cultures, and scanned them individually in a spectrometer to find their fluorescence/OD. Because we would’ve had to use larger cultures we would’ve had to use a larger volume of TNT/NG to achieve the same concentration; as TNT/NG was already in limited supply currently this would’ve massively limited the amount of experiments we were able to do.
In an example experiment: “Investigating E. coli resistance to TNT”. In this experiment we want to roughly find the level of TNT at which growth is inhibited.
Using the plate reader...
We have to use cultures of around 200 ul.
Using 12 wells, each with 100ul of TNT per ml of Media.
On the plate reader this experiment would require 240 ul TNT.
Without using the plate reader...
We have to use cultures of around 2 ml.
Using 12 falcon tubes, each with 100ul of TNT per ml of Media.
Using standard techniques this experiment would require 2.4 ml TNT.
The protocol for using the TECAN machine was initially as follows:
Create a 96-well plate using the desired combination of cells, media and chemicals.
Place the plate into the machine and run the program containing your method. This will then scan the plate and create the initial data set.
Remove the plate from the machine and place the plate into a shaking incubator, (800 rpm, 37 °C) until the next time point (usually 1 hour).
At the appointed time return the plate to the machine and scan again, creating further data sets. Repeat this until you have the data required.
Using this method we obtained our initial results. However, the flaw in this method is that during times at which we had no access to the lab (between 17:30 and 8:00 each day) we could not measure the plates, only leave them to grow in the incubator, leading to large gaps in our data in those experiments. To combat this we created a new method.
Create a 96-well plate using the desired combination of cells, media and chemicals.
Place the plate into the machine and run the program containing your new method. This method contains instructions to use the shaking/heating function of the machine to replicate the function of a shaking incubator.
