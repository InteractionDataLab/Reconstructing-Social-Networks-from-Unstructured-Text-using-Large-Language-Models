        In dry lab work, we used the work of wet lab experiments, established an entire system whose function is real-time monitoring the condition of MFCs. Our system can remotely show the output voltage of MFC, thereby automatically calculate the current PNP concentration. The detailed description of dry lab work is as following.
 
 
 
DETAILED INFOMATION
 
 
 
 
        First of all, in order to accurately measure the output voltage of MFCs, we looked for appropriate voltmeter on the market and gave them an extensive evaluation. The final choice is UNI-T UT800 Series of high precision digital bench-type multimeter because of its accurate performance (Resolution 0.1mV). Then, we used Z-TEK RS232 to USB cable to link the voltage meters to the computer.

        We use software LabView to develop our program: this program based on the COM Port Aggregation Protocol from the voltmeter reads the output voltage of the current MFC device in real time and then puts the value into empirical formula (the relationship between output voltage and PNP concentration was tested and concluded by the experiment before)to calculate current PNP substrate concentrations.

        In addition, our program can also fabricate the curve based on the PNP--voltage empirical formula, and note the measured values point based on real-time scanning. It is noticeable that, our program also show an incredible compatibility. If the user had known the true value of PNP substrate concentration, then he could easily put a note into the source code in order to correct the false point.

       Currently, we use the telnet program developed by third party to run our program in smartphones. So we can monitor our MFC device whenever and wherever we are. So we can monitor our MFCs device whenever and wherever we are.

       In the future, we will develop a new version of our app (may be published at the end of 2014), our program will have multiple modes for users to choose, in the "calibrate" mode, it could be possible for the user to add new data in order to calibrate curves and even gets the more accurate formula without changing the source code. In addition, We are trying to develop a real app which can run in the Android system without any other Telnet program.
