          FUTURE DIRECTIONS
 
 
          
          After several kinds of work, we have  successfully designed a new kind of system to overcome the negative effect of  PNP and make the pollutant concentration measurable. However, that does not  mean our work comes to an end.
          First, we are going to design a suicide  gene for this biosensor, although it is harmless to people’s health and the  environment, we still need to design a serious of sequence that can make our  gene modified bacteria unable to live if it get out of the control of the  administrator.
          In addition, it should be noticed that E.coli may not be the best choice for  sewage treatment, Pseudomonas,Shewanella and  other kinds of bacteria performed better in pollutant degradation. In our lab,  several projects are underway.
          Moreover, PNP and chromate are not the only  pollutant scientist have to face with, heavy metal, hydrocarbons and aromatic  are all kinds of pollutant can be treated by methods we offered. In our study,  we have already use new parts such as BBa_K1523021 (gene for nahR), BBa_K1523022  (gene for nahE), BBa_K1523023 (gene for nahG) to degrade other kinds of organic  pollutant. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons for example naphthalene, anthracene,  phenanthrene are all pollutant we plan to deal with. We plan to use this concept  to invent other kinds of novel MFCs so that in the future novel MFCs which  measure all kinds of pollutant concentration can come into practice in  industrial area sooner or later.
