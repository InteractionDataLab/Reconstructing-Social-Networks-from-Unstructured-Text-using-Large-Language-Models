         We constructed  a pollutant substrate(PNP) bio-sensor coupling riboflavin synthetic gene cluster,  the genetically modified E.coli can secrete riboflavin when added PNP in MFC anode medium.Riboflavin is a efficient redox mediator as well as a stimulator of MFC. We created a novel MFC devices and built a quantitative monitor system of PNP via measuring voltage increment.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       DESIGN AND CREATE MFC DEVICES
 
            
MFC Assembly and Operation.
 
Generally speaking a MFC  has two electrodes, an anode and a cathode, a proton exchange membrane and a  circuit pathway linking the two electrodes for the electron transfer from anode  to cathode.

The  catholyte in all experiments was an unstirred 50 mM potassium ferricyanide solution  in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH=7.4), which was continuously open to air. The MFC  design with carbon brush electrodes is shown in Figure 12. Brush anodes were made of carbon fibers (Haoshi carbon  fiber, Lanzhou, Gansu, China) cut to a 3cm length and wound using a simple brush  manufacturing system into a twisted core consisting of two titanium wires.

We designed  a kind of cube-like two chamber MFC device, reference others’ single-chamber  researches( Logan, Cheng,  Watson, & Estadt, 2007 ). The cube was like a symmetrical 5×5×5cm polymethyl methacrylate cube, each chamber has two hole to aerate or  load medium, each cylindrical chamber has 30ml with 4cm diameter, the blue  print was shown in figure 13 . The white latex rubber gaskets were applied  between every component of MFC devices to seal (figure 14).

           Microbiological Methods
 
 
          
          It’s reported that  Shewanella, a well-known star of electricity-producing bacteria family, can secretes  riboflavin that mediate extracellular electron transfer ( Marsili et al., 2008 ) , additionally, this amazing bacteria can  produce electrically conductive pilus-like appendages called  directly transfer  electric charge by touching relative remote anode material( Gorby et al., 2006 ) . So we buy standard bacteria strain, Shewanella  oneidensis strain MR-1, from China Center of Industrial Culture Collection,  CICC.
 
Luria-Bertani  (LB) broth was inoculated with S. oneidensis strain MR-1 and incubated  aerobically at 30 °C for 5 days with shaking at 200 rpm. After assembling the  MFC (described below) devices, 2 mL of MR-1 culture was transferred to a  sterile MFC anode chamber, as well as 28ml sterile anode medium and lactate was added (20 mM) to ensure excess  electron donor. Anode medium contained (per liter): 0.46 g NH4Cl, 0.225 g  K2HPO4, 0.225 g KH2PO4, 0.117 g MgSO47H2O, 0.225 (NH4)2SO4, plus 10 ml of a  mineral mix (containing per liter: 0.1 g MnCl24H2O, 0.3 g FeSO47H2O, 0.17 g CoCl26H2O,  0.1 g ZnCl2, 0.04 g CuSO45H2O, 0.005 g AlK(SO4)212H2O, 0.005 g H3BO3,0.09gNa2MoO4,  0.12 g NiCl2, 0.02 g NaWO42H2O, and 0.10 g Na2SeO4). Medium was adjusted to pH  7, sparged with oxygen-free N2, anode was sealed with white latex gasket.
