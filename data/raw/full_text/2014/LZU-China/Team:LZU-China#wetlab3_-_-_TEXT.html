         We constructed  a pollutant substrate(PNP) bio-sensor coupling riboflavin synthetic gene cluster,  the genetically modified E.coli can secrete riboflavin when added PNP in MFC anode medium.Riboflavin is a efficient redox mediator as well as a stimulator of MFC. We created a novel MFC devices and built a quantitative monitor system of PNP via measuring voltage increment.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       PNP PROMOTE THE RIBOFLAVIN'S EXPRESS
 
            
       Genetically  modified E.coli was able to produce quantitative riboflavin dependent on  substrate’s concentration.
Using a pollutant substrate bio-sensor coupling riboflavin synthetic gene cluster, the genetically modified E.coli with plasmid pET28A can secrete riboflavin when we add PNP in medium.
 
The E.coli was incubate with LB broth  overnight at 37℃,200rpm and feed with quantitative PNP and incubate for another 12 hours  fermentation. Supernatant was collected by centrifuge at 4000×g and adjusted pH to 3~4 in order to eliminate the PNP’s absorb of blue  light, which may disorder the measurement of riboflavin. Supernatant was transferred  to spectrophotometer and measured absorb value at 444nm. E.coli strain DH5αfermented LB broth was treated by same method above as the control group  set at 0 absorption value. A riboflavin standard curve was established for  quantitatively measurement (figure 6).

E.coli SUPER SEVEN!
We  test many single colonies of genetically modified E.coli and  screen their riboflavin production at same condition, then we get the most  efficiency bacteria strain—Super Seven—as our seed bacteria. As shown in  figure6, when treated with concentration gradient of PNP, Super Seven was able  to secrete a stabilized and quantitatively amount of riboflavin. PNP, a toxic industrial  pollutant could influence the microorganism’s metabolism and growth, so that  curve goes down when PNP addition is high.
Figure-7. Concentration  of riboflavin secreted by Super Seven treated with different amount of PNP.
 
We used Gauss function to fit that  curve, it’s a good mathematics model so far (figure 8).
 
 Figure-8. A Gauss function  was built to fit curve in figure 7, the formula of this curve is
y=0.4186 + (0.96352/(0.369*SQRT(3.1416/2)))*EXP(-2*((x-0.44771)/0.369)^2)
and the adjusted R-square  value is 0.929.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                              
 
 
 
 
             Riboflavin can  stimulate the MFC power output.
 
         When  E.coli Super Seven secrete riboflavin to the anode medium or add riboflavin  manually, the MFC system will have a better performance. The riboflavin is a  kind of redox mediator; it could enhance the MFC power output in a great scale  in just a few minute (figure 8).
 
 
Figure-9. Gradient concentrations of riboflavin could raise the MFC voltage, measured  with 200Ω external resistance，peak voltages were recorded  within 5 hours after riboflavin added.
 
We found that the  most important dependent variable was not the power density or peak voltage as  we think previously, instead, voltage increment value reflect riboflavin’s concentration  best. Another fact was that the voltage increments were often dependent on  former power output.
 
 
 
 
     Measure PNP concentrations  with  MFC system
 
 
 
         
 
Measure PNP concentrations with a PNP bio-sensor  coupling riboflavin MFC stimulate system.
 
We tried to make E.coli Super Seven co-exist with Shewanella  in anode medium at the same time. When PNP pollutant was added, Super Seven  could secrete riboflavin; as a result, MFC voltage would rise and reflect the PNP  concentrations. Though riboflavin’s expression quantity was relative low as the  iGEM authority plasmid pSB1C3 is not the best expression vector, we still found  the interrelationship between PNP addition and voltage increment.
 
Figure-10. Using MFC devices measuring concentrations of PNP obtained a fitting curve.
 
We introduced(ΔE) as dependent variable, PNP concentration  is independent variable and the previous stable voltage of MFC without  pollutant treatment, E1, is an important parameter in this interrelationship.  We also created a constant value, which  dependent on our novel MFC devices and experimental data.
 
We conclude an  empirical formula for our devices:
 
 
 
 
In our experiments  with MFC devices designed by ourselves, the MFC Characteristic Constant is a  certain value, C=1.4034.
We can measure the voltage value,ΔE, and deduce the PNP  pollutant concentration, vice versa.
