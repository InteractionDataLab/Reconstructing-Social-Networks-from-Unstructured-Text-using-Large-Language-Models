        THE NOTEBOOK OF DRY LAB GROUP
 
 
        In January, We began to know the concept of iGEM introduced by Wang Han and Prof. Yang and began to recruit our members.
We found some useful papers to create our own idea.
 
 
 
Recruiting team members
We are the chosen 12 from hundreds of student. Each of us have special skills to attend this race.
 
                After March, we began to design our logo, and human practice was kicked off. Xuejing Du began to design his survey and translate the questionnaire into English. Hongxia Zhao gave a lecture to young students. In April when serious benzene pollution burst in Lanzhou, we collect the news about that.
   
  
                               
 
                After April, we began to look for appropriate voltmeter on the market and gave them an extensive evaluation. Finally, we chose the UNI-T UT800 Series of high precision digital bench-type multimeter because of its accurate performance. What's more to make the multimeter can work better with the computer, Xiao Zhang chose the Z-TEK RS232 to USB cable to link the voltage meters to the computer.
                After June in summer, we tried to design our software using LabView, meanwhile website designing was underway.
                                                     
  
                                
  
                When  August came, we attend to CCiC, and started with survey result collection in China.
In September, we collected the results from  UK  and did the data analyses. For detail, please see our questionnaire link http://www.wenjuan.com/s/RVBVzu/#jtss-qzone)
                               
                In September, Xiao released the second version of our application.
  
  
       
                In October, the result has been found by  our group and we began to design our poster
