        INVESTIGATE AND SURVEY
 
 
        We have designed  a questionnaire to survey the masses' attitude toward sewage treatment, power  generation, and MFCs. This questionnaire was made up by 16 questions and the  respondents are random selected by all ages, genders and positions in China and  U.K. 
 
 
古老巨石阵
巨石阵又称索尔兹伯里石环、环状列石、太阳神庙、史前石桌、斯通亨治石栏、斯托肯立石圈等名，是欧洲著名的史前时代文化神庙遗址，位于英格兰威尔特郡索尔兹伯里平原。
 
        We have found that in China, 69.35%  of the respondents believe that they suffer from water pollution and 14.52% of  them think their hometown is seriously polluted. But in U.K., surprisingly, 64%  of the people believe that they do not suffer from any kind of water pollution.  This interesting phenomenon appears in London (which we initially thought the  water was serious polluted by industry long times ago), all of the respondents  from London think that the water, for example in Thames, was clean and clear.

        People  show hesitation towards sewage treatment using bacteria. 32.26% of the Chinese  respondents can fully accept the recycled water using bacteria. For 64.52% of  them, recycled water using bacteria is not drinkable but it is acceptable for  toilet flushing. When gene modified bacteria involved, this number is decreased  to 59.68%. Obviously, 12.91% of the Chinese people refuse to using this kind of  water and even 3.23% of them fight against gene modified gem using for sewage  treatment. This situation is similar in U.K.  Things have changed in Microbial Fuel Cells, Thermo power are the main  power supply for China and UK (although most of the Englishmen do not know  that.  These two countries, although  located in different continent, share different incomes and outcomes,  demonstrates a similar trend about MFC. Over 85.49% of Chinese think that the  electric bill is not expensive and 78.94% of Britain respondents hold the same  view. 76.78% of the respondents in china believe that it is necessary for their  own country to develop the use of MFCs, in U.K., this number is 63.16%.
        Overall, many people doubt it is safe to drink the water purified by bacteria,  but they are still optimistic to the future of MFCs.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        TEAM MEETING & MEETUPS
 
        #我们队每周都会举办全体队员参加的研讨会。会上，队员们相互交流一周以来的工作进展，探讨实验以及human practice中遇到的各种问题，并一起寻求解决方法。有时，我们还会邀请指导老师和学术顾问出席我们的研讨会，为我们提出各种意见和建议。
        In addition, our  team attended several meetups, we joined CCiC (Central China iGEMers’ Consortium) hold in Central China Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. The  conference aims to help teams improve performance in the 2014 iGEM competition,  arouse awareness of intra-regional collaboration so as to enhance better  communication among iGEM teams in China by establishing the CCiC. We listened  to the reports given by peer groups shared our ideas with them as well in  August. In October, we went to Beijing to visit another team-BIT and cooperated  with them.
 
 
 
 
 
 
         INFORMATION SESSIONS
 
        #我们在兰州大学的各个校区举办了多场宣讲会。为不同专业不同年级的同学们普及基本合成生物学知识，介绍iGEM比赛，以及我们的项目。讲座让数以百计的同学们了解了MFC的基本原理，以及使用MFC解决环境污染问题的美好前景。
        此外，我们还联系了兰州市的一些中学，并计划在赴美参加GJ前在兰州市的多所高中举办类似的宣讲会，为高中生普及相关科学知识，让他们感受到合成生物学的魅力。
