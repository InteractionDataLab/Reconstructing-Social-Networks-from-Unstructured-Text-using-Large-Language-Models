Species
Strain No/name
Risk Group
Disease    risk to humans? If so, which disease
 1
E. coliK 12
DH5 alpha
1
Yes. May    cause irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, may affect kidneys.    However, E. coli K-12 is not considered a human or animal pathogen nor is it    toxicogenic. Any concerns for E. coli K-12 in terms of health considerations are mitigated    by its poor ability to colonize the colon and establish infections.
 2
Shewenella    Onedensis
MR1
1
No, S. oneidensis MR-1 belongs to a class of bacteria known as "Dissimilatory Metal-Reducing Bacteria (DMRB)" because of their ability to couple metal reduction with their metabolism. It cannot cause diseases

        We have taken safety courses before so the entire  group members know how to protect ourselves in experiments.
        As for environment, some of the masses hesitate it  may cause genetic pollution to the environment, but it should be noticed that  the gene modified E.coli we construct cannot express our target gene unless it  is stimulated by the pollutant PNP.
