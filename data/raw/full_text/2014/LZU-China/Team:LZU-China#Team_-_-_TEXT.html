LZU-China 2014
 
 
 
 
          The LZU-china iGEM 2014 team consists of 13 dedicated undergraduate students forming a large        family. This year, it is our second year to attend iGEM. There is no doubt that we are all        enthusiastic for researches and experiments. All of us have been looking        forward to understanding more about life sciences.
          What's more there are also 4 instructors and 6 advisers in our team. With their instructions and advices, We can translate our ideas  into reality much easier.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        STUDENT MEMBERS
 
 
 
 
 
 
QI WU
 
          She is a senior student who loves life and takes great delight in scientific research. For one thing, she likes reading, swimming and playing badminton. She always spends her vacations in having journeys with her friends. For another, as a reliable people who have admirable learning and communication skills, she spares no effort to do her science research during working days.
 
 
XIAO ZHANG
 
         Xiao Zhang majoring in biological science is from Tianjin. As one of the most outstanding student leaders of Lanzhou University, he has many kinds of skills. He is really keen on science research, especially interested in functional genomics, microbiology, and bioinformatics. In our team, as the chief information officer, he developed the monitor program and build the automatic monitor system. In addition, he is also in charge of our wiki editing.
 
 
 
XUEJING DU
 
         Xuejing Du is one of the student leader of group members in our project. His interest is microbiology and behavioural sciences. It is he who has recruited the key members of this team and has brought a new concept to MFCs. He not only wrote over the 80% of the paperwork but also has done 90% of the artwork for wiki, poster and uniform. Human practice, which we thought a tough, sophisticated burden, was carried by him. In addition, he has designed a questionnaire and made a survey about people's attitude towards sewage treatment and the use of microbial fuel cells in China and UK.His creative ideas help us vastly. Now, he is preparing for the presentation in order to help our team to attend Giant Jamboree in October.
