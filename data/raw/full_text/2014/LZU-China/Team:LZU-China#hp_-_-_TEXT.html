        INVESTIGATE AND SURVEY
 
 
        We have designed  a questionnaire to survey the masses' attitude toward sewage treatment, power    generation, and MFCs. This questionnaire was made up by 16 questions and the  respondents are random selected by all ages, genders and positions in China and    U.K. 
 
 
Complete the survey
Students are taught to complete the survey made   by our own.
 
        We have found that in China, 68.23%  of the respondents believe that they suffer from water pollution   and 15.38% of  them think their hometown is seriously polluted. But in U.K., surprisingly, 70.59%  of the people believe that they do not suffer from any kind of water   pollution.  This interesting phenomenon appears in London (which we initially thought the  water was serious polluted by industry long times ago), all of the   respondents  from London think that the water, for example in Thames, was clean and clear.
                
        People  show hesitation towards sewage treatment using bacteria. 32.31% of the Chinese  respondents can   fully accept the recycled water using bacteria. For 64.62% of  them, recycled water using bacteria is not drinkable but it is acceptable for  toilet flushing. When   gene modified bacteria involved, this number is decreased  to 61.54%. Obviously, 9.23% of the Chinese people refuse to using this kind of  water and even 3.08% of them   fight against gene modified gem using for sewage  treatment. This situation is similar in U.K. 
               
        Things have changed in Microbial Fuel Cells, Thermo power are the main  power supply for China and UK   (although most of the Englishmen do not know  that.  These two countries, although  located in different continents, share different incomes and outcomes,    demonstrates a similar trend about MFC. Over 84.62% of Chinese think that the  electric bill is not expensive and 82.35% of Britain respondents hold the same  view.
            
        78.46% of the respondents in China believe that it is necessary for their  own country to develop the   use of MFCs, in U.K., this number is 52.94%. Overall, many people doubt it is safe to drink the water purified by bacteria,  but they are still optimistic to the   future of MFCs.  
            
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        TEAM MEETING & MEETUPS
 
 
 
        We have held a number of presentations to introduce fundamental knowledge of synthetic biology, iGEM   competition and the program we would complete ourselves to students studying in different grades and majors.Those lectures made hundreds of students understand the   basic principle of MFCs, and the prospect of using MFCs to solve the environmental problems.
        In addition, our  team attended several meetups, we joined CCiC (Central China iGEMers’ Consortium) hold in Central China Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. The  conference aims to help teams improve performance in the 2014 iGEM competition,  arouse   awareness of intra-regional collaboration so as to enhance better  communication among iGEM teams in China by establishing the CCiC. We listened  to the reports given   by peer groups shared our ideas with them as well in  August.
 
 
 
Xiao Zhang was introducing our work in   the CCiC meetups.
During the CCiC iGEMer Meetups, LZU-China gave the plenary lecture to all the participants. And this lecture was critically acclaimed by a lot   of specialists and students.
 
 
Shengcang Zhu and Xuejing Du are listening to the lecture in CCiC.
Not only for our group but also other groups gave their experimental reports in CCiC so   we learned a lot from others.
 
        In October, we went to Beijing to visit another team-BIT and cooperated  with them.

         INFORMATION SESSIONS
 
 
 
       We have held a number of presentations to  introduce fundamental knowledge of synthetic biology, iGEM   competition and the  program we would complete ourselves to students studying in different grades  and majors.Those lectures made hundreds of students understand the   basic  principle of MFCs, and the prospect of using MFCs to solve the environmental  problems.
 
 
Hongxia Zhao's statement of our   project
Unlike students majoring in biology, most of students in other majors were not familiar with MFCs, thanks Hongxia, her presentation changed the   situation
 
        In addition, we have also contacted some of  the high school in Lanzhou, China. We planed to hold   similar presentations to  popularize scientific common sense among high school students in order to charm  them with the magic power of synthetic biology before the   time we will go to  Giant Jamboree.
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       COOPERATION WITH OTHER SCIENTIFIC   INSTITUTIONS
 
 
        Cooperation with other scientific institutions is also which we took part in: we went to Membrane   Science and Technology Research Institute of Gansu Province, CNPC for study, and even went to countryside to investigate the condition of water pollution.
        
 
 
 
Our cooperations
These are our friend   cooperations, thanks to their help!.
 
 
Foreign experts
We invited experts from other   country to give us lectures.
