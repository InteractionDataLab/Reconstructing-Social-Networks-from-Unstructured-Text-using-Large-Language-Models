        "Rome was not built in a day." No matter which group we belong to, we took our work for almost a whole year. What did we do on earth? This notebook will show you in detail.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        THE NOTEBOOK OF WET LAB GROUP
 
     March 2014
Buy 300ml each chamber big MFC, buy  multimeter, stainless steel, enameled wire. Buy PEM(proton exchange membrane)  membrane and use H2O2 and H2SO4 boiled solution handle the PEM.
first appliance, and it is the biggest one. We use it and  incubate a PNP endurance bacteria named LZU-3.We hoped that LZU-3 could degrade  potassium dichromate, but we failed.
 
 
 April/June 2014
We prepared anode medium and cathode  medium, incubate the Pseudomonas  aeruginosa and Shewanella oneidensis and LZU-3. Testing the big MFC devices and collected the data.
 
 
July 2014
We tried to research how dose PNP influence  the MFC power output. We buy 4 others MFC devices from internet, and prepare  PEM carbon brush for it.
 
 
        
 
 
August 2014
We designed our own device and tried our  best to manufacture the new MFC. We tested the performance of these 11 MFC  devices. Different sizes(from 160*160*80 mm to 25*25*25 mm) were used in our experiment. At last we found  that 50*50*50 mm  is the best size of this battery.
      
  
 
 
 
  In September and October, we run our MFCs  and gain a lot of data, we tried to figure out, dose riboflavin can stimulate  the MFC power output, and, how accuracy did the genetically engineered E.coli  response to the PNP concentration. we worked out empirical curves about the  relationship between PNP concentration and output voltage.
 
 
We also measured the riboflavin expression data of the genatically modified E.coli.
