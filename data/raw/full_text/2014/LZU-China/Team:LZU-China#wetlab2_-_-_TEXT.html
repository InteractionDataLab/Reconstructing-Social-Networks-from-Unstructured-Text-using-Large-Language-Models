         We constructed  a pollutant substrate(PNP) bio-sensor coupling riboflavin synthetic gene cluster,  the genetically modified E.coli can secrete riboflavin when added PNP in MFC anode medium.Riboflavin is a efficient redox mediator as well as a stimulator of MFC. We created a novel MFC devices and built a quantitative monitor system of PNP via measuring voltage increment.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        GENETIC ENGINEERED BACTERIA
 
            
          We designed this pathway for our purpose. As you can see, the NsrR is constitutive expressed in almost all E. coli orgnisms and it can repress the promoter PyeaR. In our project we found that this sensitive system is also adjusted to the PNP(p-nitrophenol). So we constructed this sensor pathway.
          The sensor will cause the expression of riboflavin, a kind of mediator which can induce the generation of current in MFCs, to show the appearance of PNP. We can estimate the concentration of PNP.

          Besides, we find many  genes can catalyze the reduction of Cr(VI). They can be used in the cathode to  reduce these heavy metal ions.

        ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF PNP SENSOR
 
          
          We found that the part BBa_K381001 by  iGEM10_BCCS-Bristol is a sensor which can detect the appearance of nitrate and  nitrite. So we perfomed an experience by this part to see if this part can  detect PNP(p-Nitrophenol).           We got a good result.You can see the PNP  can also induce the green fluorescence.

          Firstly we got the plasmid with K1172303  from Registry. We cut the plasmid by EcoRI and XbaI, then put the Pnsr(K216005+B0030  this sequence was synthesized by company)  into the gap.

          The size of the whole part is about  3700bp(without plasmid), we test the assembling result by PCR(sense:5’---TTCCCATCTATAATCCTCCCTGATTCTTCG---3’;anti-sense:5’---GAATTCTCTAGATTACAACTGTTGTTCAAGCTGTT---3’).  From the gel picture we can see the size is right.

        ABOUT THE REDUCING Cr IONS GENES
 
         
 
          We found  four genes to reduce the Cr(VI) to Cr(III). They are nahG, nahR, nahE, chrR and yieF. We didn’t do the deep research about them because of time  limitation. They can be used in the general plasmids such as pBR322. We just  made them to be the formation of Biobrick. More uses and functions need to be  demonstrated and found.
nahG: We got the sequence from Pseudomonas putida
          (Primer:sense:5’---CCGGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGATGAAAAACAATAAACCTGGCTTGCGC---3’;
          anti-sense:5’---AAAATACTAGTAGCGGCCGCTGCAGTCACCCTTGACGTAGCACACC---3’)
nahE: We got the sequence from Pseudomonas putida
          (Primer:sense:5’---CCGGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGATGTCGAATAAAATTATGAAAACGTCGCG---3’;
          anti-sense:5’---AAAATACTAGTAGCGGCCGCTGCAGCTACTTCAATTCATTACTGTATTTAGCGTG---3’)
nahR: We got the sequence from Pseudomonas putida
          (Primer:sense:5’---  CCGGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGATGAAAAACAATAAACCTGGCTTGCGC---3’;
          anti-sense:5’---AAAATACTAGTAGCGGCCGCTGCAGTCACCCTTGACGTAGCACACC---3’)
chrR: We got the sequence from Escherichia coli str.  K-12
          (Primer:sense:5’---  CCGGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGATGAAAAAAATAGTCCAGTCGGAAGG---3’;
          anti-sense:5’---AAAATACTAGTAGCGGCCGCTGCAGTCAGGCCTTTTTGTGCTGTTCAAC---3’)
yieF: We got the sequence from Escherichia coli str.  K-12
          (Primer:sense:5’---  GAATTCGGATCCATGTCTGAAAAATTGCAGGTGG---3’;
          anti-sense:5’---GAATTCTCTAGATTAGATCTTAACTCGCTGAATAAA---3’)
