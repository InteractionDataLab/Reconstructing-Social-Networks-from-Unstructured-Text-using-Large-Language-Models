Main Assembly Map
     The main assembly map describes all the constructions that would be done in the project, but some of them have not been performed in time of the iGEM deadline. The succesfully constructed assemblies is indicated by a green check point and the unsuccessfull constructions are indicated by a red "X". Click on these assemblies to access the lab form.

Assemblies forms
Assembly form template
This is the template designed to help with the laboratory organization during the assemble of biological parts. If you want to use the assembly method we used you can print the form and complete it for each construction. Hope it helps :)

PCR lasR ( BBa_C0079 ). The purpose of this PCR was to add the RBS ( BBa_K143021 ), through addition of the sequence in the primer foward, and also to remove the LVA tag. In our primers we only added the restriction sites X and S, so we still need to put it in the pSB1C3 for the Biobrick standard completion. When standardized this part will be called BBa_K1521001 .

PCR the qteE gene for amplification. We also added the RBS ( BBa_K143021, ) using the foward primer. In our primers we only added the restriction sites X and S, so we still need to put it in the pSB1C3 for the Biobrick standard completion. When standardized this biobrick will be called BBa_K1521000 .

OBS: This was one of the parts sent by the Imperial College Team. Because of a comunication failure we assumed that this part was comming without the RBS, so we included a RBS in the parts we were going to use with this  Lac promotor :)
