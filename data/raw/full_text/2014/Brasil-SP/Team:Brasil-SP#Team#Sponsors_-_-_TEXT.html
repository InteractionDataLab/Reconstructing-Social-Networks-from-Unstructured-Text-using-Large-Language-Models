Companies
Braskem
Braskem operates in the chemical and petrochemical industry and is now the largest producer of thermoplastic resins in the America, the largest producer of biopolymers with green polyethylene and largest producer of polypropylene in the United States. The set of Braskem products also includes other basic inputs and it has industrial plants located in Brazil, United States and Germany. Also, Braskem is also included among the fifty most innovative companies in the world.

Life Technologies
Founded in November 2008, by the merge of Invitrogen Corporation and Applied Biosystems Inc., and bought in 2014 by Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation, Life Technologies became a brand name for biotechnology products and service renamed Life Sciences Solutions. Company's products are found in nearly every life science lab as reagents via its InvitrogenTM and as instrument systems. Life Tehnologies provided our huge reagents list, being fundamental for the project.
Life Technologies
São Carlos Química
Created in 2011,  this company is located in the city of São Carlos and it is specialized in laboratory materials and reagents.
Biomol
Biomol Equipment and Products For Laboratories (or in portuguese Biomol Equipamentos e Produtos Para Laboratórios) is a brazilian company which provides equipment and supplies to university laboratories and companies across Brazil. This is a partner company of the research and seeks to collaborate with the growth of research in the country. Biomol contributed with project expenses financially.

Research Groups
CePOF
The Research Center in Optics and Photonics (CEPOF) performs research activities involving the use of optics and lasers in various fields of human knowledge. In Atomic and Molecular Physics, beams of laser light and magnetic fields are used for cooling and trapping of atoms.  In health field, CEPOF group develops applied research in diseases treatment and diagnosis techniques. They use the interaction between light and biological tissues to improve the diagnosis techniques and the photodynamic therapy, the interaction of light with a photosensitizing agent in the presence of oxygen, to treat local cancer and other diseases.

Nanomedicine and Nanotoxicology Group
Created in 2013, the Nanomedicine and Nanotoxicology Group (GNano) is part of Sao Carlos Institute of Physics, University of Sao Paulo. Under the supervision of Professor Valtencir Zucolotto, GNano has as its main focus the application of nanotechnology in medical and biomedical areas. Synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials, nanotoxicology studies in vivo and in vitro and development of devices such as biosensors are commonly performed. Experiments of flow cytometry and fluorometry related to our iGEM project were performed at this laboratory.

Molecular Biophysics Research Group - Sérgio Mascarenhas
The spectroscopic techniques are some of the various physics tools that enable the knowledge of the biomolecules structures at the atomic level. Studies on development in the Molecular Biophysics research Group are trying to interpret molecular structures due to interactions in different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Electronic spectroscopy, circular dichroism, fluorescence, FT-IR, EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) allow monitoring conformational changes of biomolecules in the presence of ligands, chemical or physical agents, action of different organic solvents, and molecular mechanisms involved in functional processes and denaturation and refolding of proteins.
Department of Genetics and Evolution
The Department of Genetics and Evolution ( DGE /UFSCar) along with the Postgraduate Course in Evolutionary Genetics and Molecular Biology ( PPGGEv /UFSCar) were founded in early 90’s. During their nearly 25 years of existence, Professors (including our Instructor, Dr. Francis Nunes, and our Advisor, Dr. Flavio Henrique Silva) and students from DGE and PPGGEv have produced knowledge in the following scientific areas: Evolutionary Genetics, Molecular and Structural Biology, Basic and Applied Biochemistry, Conservation Genetics and Animal Breeding.
Molecular Biology Lab
The Molecular Biology Lab (LBM) is led by Dr. Flavio Henrique Silva (UFSCar) and performs studies about biotechnology of plants and for insect pest control, cellulases and glycoside hydrolases, inhibitors of cysteine peptidases, peptidases, metagenomics and prospecting of genes with biotechnological interest.
Microbiology Lab
The Microbiology Lab of the Departament of Morphology and Pathology (DMP) is led by Dr. Paulo Lacava (UFSCar) and performs studies about Basic and Applied Microbiology, such as Agricultural Microbiology, Environmental Microbiology, Microbial Ecology, Plant-Microorganism Interaction, Biotechnological Processes and Biological Control.
Group of New Materials and Devices
The Group of New Materials and Devices (GNMD) is headquartered in Microelectronics Laboratory (LME) of the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, PSI-EPUSP, the Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo (USP). It conducts researches on the collection and properties of New Materials (Thin Films and Nanostructured Materials) and its applications in microelectronic and / or related devices.
Universities
University of São Paulo
Created in 1934, the University of São Paulo (USP) is a public institution maintained by the State of São Paulo. It is composed by 7 campi in different cities of the state, offering more than 90 courses. USP is internationally recognized by its scientific productivity, achieving great positions on several world rankings.
USP
Federal University of São Carlos
Founded in 1968, UFSCar offers over 120 undergraduate and postgraduate courses with a strong tradition in biotechnology, engineering and health fields.
UFSCar
São Carlos Institute of Physics
The Institute of Physics is located in the USP campi in São Carlos. The institute wes created in 1994 and at the moment offers four courses: Bachelor in Biomolecular Physics, Physics, Computaional Physics and also Exact Sciences.
Support
State University of São Paulo
Unesp is a multicampus university in Brazil; such unique characteristic allows intense and diversified activities in the state of São Paulo. The students of the Institute of Biosciences, Letters and Exact Sciences (IBILCE), localized in São José do Rio Preto campus, developed the Bioethics Questionnaire. This campus dates back to 1957 when the College of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters was founded. It was incorporated into UNESP in 1976 and is marked by diversity and by the development of teaching, research and outreach activities in the fields of Biological Sciences, Exact Sciences, Humanities and Technologies.
