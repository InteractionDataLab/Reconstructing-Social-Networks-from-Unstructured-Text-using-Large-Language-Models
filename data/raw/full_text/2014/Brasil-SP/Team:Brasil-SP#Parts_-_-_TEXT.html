This biobrick is a transcriptional unit with the RBS SpoVG (BBa_K143021) and the qteE coding sequence.
The qteE gene was discovered in 2010 by Richard Siehnel et al. and is thought to be the main quorum sensing regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mechanism of action is yet not known, but in the article published qteE's ability to create expression barriers was confirmed through several experiments.

This biobrick is a transcriptional unit with the RBS SpoVG (BBa_K143021) and the lasR coding sequence. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa the LasR protein is responsable for inducing the expression of some genes related to virulence. For this biobrick to work properly you need an aditional part (BBa_P0312) that produces homoserine lactone (HSL)
