Experimental Methodology
For the assemblies constructuion we addopted the following method:
We used the pSB1C3 vector from the Biobrick BBa_J04450 . Using this biobrick we added a red/white selection, where the red colonies are those which do not have the assembly, and the white ones are the correct ones.
