Team
The Brasil-SP team gathers three of the best Brazilian universities. Undergraduate, postgraduate students and professors of University of São Paulo (USP), Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) and São Paulo State University (UNESP) joined to form a unique team. The team is composed of students from several backgrounds, but mostly physicists and biologists.
Student Members
Brenda Clara Moreira
Federal University of São Carlos/UFSCar
Undergraduate Student
Biotechnology
     At first sight, Brenda is apparently introverted, but in reality she is full of skills - she was the protagonists of our crowndfunding video. She actively participated in efforts to raise funds to enable us enter the competition as well as during the stages of formation and consolidation of the Brasil-SP team and project design.
Camila Bramorski
University of São Paulo/USP
Undergraduate Student
Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     She helps in many areas of the project but mainly with the financials and with the wiki webdesign and construction. She is responsible for recording the weekly group reunion and for making some jokes.
Danilo Keiji Zampronio
University of São Paulo/USP
Undergraduate Student
Physical and Biomolecular Sciences
     Wet lab slave. Working on the assemblies and experimental strategies with enthusiasm. Also participated in the wiki, presentation and poster construction and design. And more importantly, he was responsable for receiving the boxes he loves so much.
Guilherme Engelberto Kundlatsch
Federal University of São Carlos/UFSCar
Undergraduate Student
Biotechnology
     He is working at Biology Molecular lab with our circuit construction and characterization and at Microbiology lab studying our chassis. His great capacity of thinking in new outlandish ideas helps us with our project. Directly from a cold land, he is a boy as young as synthetic biology. Better known as Yoshi, he is carrying our team to give 1 UP in iGEM.
