Main Assembly Map
     The main assembly map describes all the constructions that would be done in the project, but some of them have not been performed in time of the iGEM deadline. The succesfully constructed assemblies are indicated by a green check point and the unsuccessfull constructions are indicated by a red "X". Click on these assemblies to access the lab form.
