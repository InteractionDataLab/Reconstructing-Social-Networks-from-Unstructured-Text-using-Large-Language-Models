SeaDNA
Create cell “factories” that mass-produce a biopolymer that is found naturally in the slime of the hagfish.  The exciting properties of this biopolymer indicate that it will have many potential applications in the food, medical devices, and textile industries.
SeeDNA
Development of a novel method for DNA-based diagnostics using bacterial detection of target DNA sequences such as the Human Papillomavirus. We foresee applications for this in healthcare settings in resource-poor, developing countries.
