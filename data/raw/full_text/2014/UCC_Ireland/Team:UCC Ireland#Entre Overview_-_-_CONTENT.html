The effect Synthetic Biology will have on Biotech is comparable to the effect the microcontroller had on the computing industry. Before the microcontroller, computers were seen as large, expensive things that only governments and a few large corporations could afford. Now, only 50 years later it’d be hard to imagine a world where computers weren’t a pervasive part of everything.</P><P>In early 2014, <A href="http://benthiclabs.com/">Benthic Labs Ltd.</A> was founded with the goal to make consumer-focused products in order to help do the same for synthetic biology and biotechnology.

In fact, there is such a lack of support for nascent biotechs that the span from idea to viable proof of concept has earned the nickname the “Valley of Death of Biotech”. Still at an early stage in development, <A href="http://benthiclabs.com/">Benthic Labs Ltd.</A> will require significant initial investment. Launching a business in biotechnology takes a lot of time. </P><P>For the early investment there is a concern that new investors will evaluate the company's worth as much lower than the worth perceived by the founders. As a consequence founders are wary of giving away too large a share of their company in exchange for the cash investment. In order to avoid this scenario, we are researching a number of options that will allow us to maintain:</P><UL><LI>Crowdsourcing campaign (ie.

This movement aims to help make biology a worthwhile pursuit for citizen scientists, amateur biologists, and do-it-yourself biological engineers who value openness and safety.
                            Cathal dropped out of a Ph.D. program at a big cancer lab a few years ago in favor of doing it on his own, spending €4,000 to equip a laboratory in his family’s house. He provides affordable, open-source DNA development platforms, kits and strains for beginners to easily learn the engineering of bacteria. He has been commended for inventing the DremelFuge, a small centrifuge that can be fabricated by a 3D printer at a far lower cost than industrial models.
