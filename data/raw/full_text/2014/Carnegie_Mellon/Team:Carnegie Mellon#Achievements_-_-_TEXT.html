We accomplished many things this summer...
Formed and registered the team .
Obtained a Summer Undergraduate Research Grant (SURG)
Submitted 35 parts to the Registry
Documented new photosensitizers , an estrogen biosensor and a robust T7 RNA Polymerase reporter system
Validated a new photosensitizer and improved another
Improved the characterization of fluorescent proteins and a T7 RNA Polymerase reporter system
Modeled our sensor and the influence of estrogen on a fish population
