Dr. Cheryl Telmer
Carnegie Mellon University
Department of Biological Sciences
Dr. Telmer is one of the main advisors of the CMU iGEM team. She provided guidance and training especially for the lab work. This included helping us make up protocols to analyze fluorescent proteins for potential reporters, construct and test our intein sensor, construct the Interlab Measurement Study plasmids and run photobleaching experiments for the KillerRed. In addition she helped us troubleshoot when we ran into difficulties in experimentation, and helped us plan and organize future tasks.
Dr. Marcel Bruchez
Carnegie Mellon University
Department of Biological Sciences
Dr. Bruchez is a faculty advisor for the CMU iGEM team. He secured lab space for our team and gave us technical advice about our project, especially how to analyze and present fluorescence data from the TECAN. Dr. Bruchez also helped with the construction of photo-bleaching chambers needed to test the photosensitizers.
Dr. Natasa Miskov-Zivanov
Carnegie Mellon University
Electrical and Computer Engineering
Dr. Miskov-Zivanov helped with the modeling portion of the project. She introduced us to new modeling languages, and gave us insight into how to improve our models such that they could be better applied to the real world and the wet lab.
Dr. Carrie B. Doonan
Carnegie Mellon University
Department of Biological Sciences
Dr. Doonan is the Director of Undergraduate Laboratories and Teaching Professor at Carnegie Mellon, Department of Biological Sciences and in addition to BioBootcamp training was involved with guiding development of the SynBio Educational Kits. Her expertise in teaching and understanding students was invaluable.
Dr. Jeanne VanBriesen
Carnegie Mellon University
Civil and Environmental Engineering
Dr. VanBriesen provided background information on water testing. She also gave us input on our sensor and how it can be used in the context of water testing.
Dr. Terrence Collins
Carnegie Mellon University
Department of Chemistry
Dr. Collins is a world expert on Green Oxidation Compounds that are used to remove estrogenic compounds from water safely. He was the inspiration for our project.
Dr. Catalina Achim and Hannah Diorio-Toth
DNAZone, Carnegie Mellon University
Dr. Achim is the Director of DNAzone and Hannah is the CNAST Administrative Assistant and Outreach Coordinator. Together they advised and supported the team with the development of Outreach materials.
Taylor Canady and Genoa Warner
Carnegie Mellon University
Department of Chemistry
Taylor and Genoa are graduate students and conceived and constructed teaching kits for demonstrating DNA base-pairing and acted as outreach advisors. Genoa studies the chemistry of endocrine disruptors and offered advice.
