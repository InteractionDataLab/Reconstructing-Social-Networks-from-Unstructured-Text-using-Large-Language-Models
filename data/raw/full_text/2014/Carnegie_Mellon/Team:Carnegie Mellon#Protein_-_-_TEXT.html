Fluorescent Protein Evaluation
A set of five fluorescent proteins (blue, green, yellow, orange and red) were analyzed to determine their signal to noise ratio. This method of quantification is meant to provide information about the amount of fluorescence that can be detected from the protein through the background fluorescence from other cellular components. We used two cell lines (MACH and Top10) to determine the signal-to-noise ratio of the proteins in a cellular system.
Results
Based on the signal-to-noise ratios, which were maximized in the yellow, orange and red fluorescent proteins, we decided to use the yellow and red fluorescent proteins as reporters for our sensor. The crossover fluorescence analysis data was also used to designate the yellow and red fluorescent proteins as reporters.
