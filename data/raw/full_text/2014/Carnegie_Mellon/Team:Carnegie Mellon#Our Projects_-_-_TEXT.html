Policies & Practices Advancement
"Policies & Practices is the study of how your work affects the world, and how the world affects your work." -Peter Carr, Director of Judging

Places where we have reached with the SynBio Educational Series and Beyond the Bench[mark]
An Overview
     The Carnegie Mellon University 2014 iGEM team spent hundreds of hours teaching students, teachers, and community members about synthetic biology and endocrine disruptors and researching policies, ethics and impacts involved in the latter. We collaborated with other teams to heighten awareness of synthetic biology and promote a scientific interface between the lab and society, while working on a project that will help detect for micropollutants, such as estrogen/estradiol, in water sources cost-efficiently. Our project directly affected how we saw Policies & Practices as a way to start an initiative dedicated to going past the benchmark that limits science classrooms and literacy across America.
Greatest Achievements
Created Beyond the Bench[mark]; an initiative to educate middle and high school students on synthetic biology and endocrine disruptors
Presented at 12 events for beta-testing the SynBio Educational Series and raising awareness about our iGEM research on endocrine disruptors
Set up 3 interviews with experts in endocrine disruptors, water testing, micropollutants, and synthetic biology public outreach
Delved into the controversial world that is policies, ethics and impacts around endocrine disruptors
Hosted our first iGEM Meetup with 5 North American teams in attendance, including one high school team from Montgomery, NJ
Public Outreach with 490 people in first 120 days and a scheduled 625 in the next 120 days
Our Areas of Policies & Practices
The 7 areas in which the Carnegie Mellon iGEM team worked on are
Beyond the Bench[mark] Initiative

86 followers on Twitter @CMUiGEM from over 50 different countries!
Conclusions [The End of the Beginning]
We truly hope that our work affected the world with our educational advances in synthetic biology and endocrine disruptors because we know that the world directly affected our work. Our university's founder Andrew Carnegie said, “My heart is in the work” and Carnegie Mellon President Subra Suresh further acknowledged, “Our work is from the heart.” There is no doubt that policies & practices widened our horizons this summer and helped us connect back to the community we live in. It was our pleasure to work in this division this year.
