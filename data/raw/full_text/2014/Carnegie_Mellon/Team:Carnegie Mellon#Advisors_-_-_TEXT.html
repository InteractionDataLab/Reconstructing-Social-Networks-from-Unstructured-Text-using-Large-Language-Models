Dr. Cheryl Telmer
Department of Biological Sciences
Research Biologist, Molecular Biosensor and Imaging Center
Dr. Telmer did her graduate work at Queen's University in Kingston, Canada. Her Masters focused on protein synthesis in Brassica nigra and her Ph.D detailed embryogenesis in Brassica napus at the ultrastructural level with the goal of creating a system for genetically engineering canola. During an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University studies in genetics and biotechnology led to spending 9 years in startup biotech companies specializing in recombinant protein production and analysis. After a year at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History Dr. Telmer returned to Carnegie Mellon to pursue research interests including synthetic and systems biology, and the study of proteins.
Dr. Marcel Bruchez
Department of Biological Sciences
Associate Professor, Biological Sciences and Chemistry
Director, Molecular Biosensor and Imaging Center
Dr. Bruchez develops and commercializes research tools for bio-nanotechnology - an emerging field that creates or adapts materials and chemical processes to solve biological problems. As a graduate student, he modified quantum dots - nanometer-sized crystal particles - so that they could be used to tag proteins and label cells. After graduate school, he founded Quantum Dot Corporation, which grew these materials into a significant and commercially successful tool for single molecule biological detection and for multicolor analysis of cells, ultimately acquired by Invitrogen Corporation. At Carnegie Mellon University, Dr. Bruchez is investigating the limits of fluorescent microscopy and fluorescent probes at the National Technology Center for Networks and Pathways, a national resource for biological probe development, and is applying these tools to the study of how protein synthesis, trafficking and degradation is coordinated and regulated in biological systems. Dr. Bruchez holds 17 patents, has published 28 peer-reviewed papers and has received numerous recognitions for his work. Science recognized his development of quantum dots for biological detection as one of the Top Ten Scientific Innovations of 2003. In 2006, Dr. Bruchez received the Lord Rank Prize for Optoelectronics for "realization of quantum dot nanocrystals as biological labels." Dr. Bruchez received a B.S. in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of California at Berkeley.
Dr. Natasa Miskov-Zivanov
Electrical and Computer Engineering
Adjunct Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science
Dr. Miskov-Zivanov received her Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2009. She was the founding adviser of iGEM at CMU back in 2012. Her research interests include modeling and analysis of complex biological mechanisms, systems and synthetic biology, and system design and control in biology and medicine. She has previously taught a graduate level course on computing and design automation in biology, and has been one of the organizers of International Workshop on Bio-Design Automation.
Dr. Diana Marculescu
Electrical and Computer Engineering
Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering
Associate Department Head for Academic Affairs, Electrical and Computer Engineering
Dr. Marculescu is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. She received her Dipl. Ing. degree in Computer Science from "Politehnica" University of Bucharest, Romania in 1991 and her Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from University of Southern California in 1998. She is the recipient of a National Science Foundation Faculty Career Award (2000-2004), an ACM-SIGDA Technical Leadership Award (2003), the Carnegie Institute of Technology George Tallman Ladd Research Award (2004), an ACM-SIGDA Distinguished Service Award (2010), and Best Paper Awards from IEEE Asia South-Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASPDAC 2005), IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD 2008), International Symposium on Quality of Electronic Design (ISQED 2009), and IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems (2011). Diana Marculescu was an IEEE-Circuits and Systems Society Distinguished Lecturer (2004-2005), the Chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Design Automation (2005-2009) and is an ACM Distinguished Scientist and a Senior Member of IEEE. Her research interests include energy, reliability, and variability-aware computing and CAD for non-silicon applications.
