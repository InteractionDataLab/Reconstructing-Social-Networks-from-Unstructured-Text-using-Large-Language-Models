　Dr. Tzeng told us livestock farmers used to borrow insect light traps from them to capture Bloodsucking Flies. To our surprise, <B>light traps</B> can capture even thousands of insects in just one night. Additionally, they also had some cooperation program with livestock farmers. At that time, they used many interesting approaches, such as altering light's color and intensity, to test the behavior of Bloodsucking Flies. This experience sharing provided us with some basic methods in testing insect behavior.

　Since ecological equilibrium might become the main issue that we will face in our project, Dr. Tzeng mentioned a fundamental question of why human kept on farming. Dr. Tzeng highlighted the importance of human survival, which is a special view point. Although farming is harmful to our environment, we should not regard the destruction of environment as a problem. Instead, we have to keep planting crop in order to produce enough food to survive.
</P><P><B>Experience Sharing of Dengue Fever Prevention and Control：</B>

</P><P><B>A Glimpse at the Mosquito Breeding Cage and Insect Light Trap ：</B>
　We took a look at <I>Culex pipiens molestus</I> (the underground house mosquito) breeding cage, and also learned the behavior of many kinds of mosquito.

To prevent any problem from happening, Dr. Tzeng and we inspected all the probability which may cause our project failed such as PBAN degradation in insects’ intestine (whether we have to use little thuricide to cause some holes on insects’ intestine to make it absorb our PBAN easily) and the restriction of our project (we have to capture the first “female” insect in our device, and proves that our project can actually work.). In the discussing process, we again encounters another problems, and obtain many suggestions from Dr. Tzeng as well. We hoped we can overcome all the problems, and improve our project.
</P><P>
　In briefly conclusion, our team and Dr. Tzeng had deep discussion in this visit. Not only experience sharing but also project inspection that made us learn so much and obtains many new ideas which let us realize how to make use of our project to achieve the best result.

The farm owner not only instructed us a suitable place but also showed us how his farm deal with the moth. Nowadays, they used a device with  <B>blue light</B> to attract the moths. Besides, it is equipped with a fan for sweeping the insects into the device. We are inspired by those ideas and utilize it to improve our device.

Even with the funding support by our school, iGEM is still an economically taxing project. With our many spendings on materials for our device developing and testing, we need to find sponsorship. We planned reach out to several corporations and propose our project. We went to our alumni association for contact information of alumni founded enterprises.</P><DIV id="seemore10"><P>SEE MORE</P></DIV><DIV class="move10"><P>
Due to privacy concerns, we were not granted this information. However, our team member Rachel, who proposed to the alumni association and met with the CEO, was invited to an alumni dinner meeting. She was given a five minute timeslot onstage to explain the iGEM competition, the workings of our team, and how we need their support. This immediately drew the interest of the many successful entrepreneurs who graduated from NCTU. We successfully raised five hundred thousand NT dollars that night, right at the venue.</P><P> We also received emails showing giving encouragement and support to our team from many alumni who went on to tell more alumni who were not present about iGEM and us. 
It is this spirit of always helping out one of our own that established NCTU’s excellence. We cannot be more thankful to their help. There are also several other corporations that we are still communicating with. The whole experience really allowed us to get in touch with the real world and society.

Through this forum, We not only got many good ideas about our project but were also glad to have a chance to introduce our project to more and more people.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="text_right"><P>See more photos here: <A href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bzb2FOOx1vmjRklLRnZoLXl0ZlU&amp;usp=sharing&amp;tid=0Bzb2FOOx1vmjQ3R4WEMyejJzQzg" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Google Drive</A></P></DIV><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Modeling_Assisting_TCU_Taiwan_iGEM_Team">Modeling Assisting TCU Taiwan iGEM Team</SPAN></H4><DIV><DIV class="left.h"><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.2-5-1 Skype with TCU Taiwan iGEM team members.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="right20"><P>Best Team Friend: <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:TCU_Taiwan" class="external text" rel="nofollow">TCU Taiwan</A>
　　It's our greatest honor to <B>help TCU Taiwan iGEM Team</B> in<B> modeling</B>. Thank TCU Taiwan for giving this opportunity. We all were very glad share our experience with you all.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="li"><DIV class="card"><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="iGEM_Advertising">iGEM Advertising</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Biocamp">Biocamp</SPAN></H4><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.3-1-1 Biocamp in NCTU.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.3-1-3 Biocamp in NCTU.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.3-1-2 Biocamp in NCTU.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>  
In the summer, our department held a bio-camp. We spent a morning teaching them what <B>synthetic biology</B> is and <B>introducing iGEM to them</B>. In the beginning, I thought they might fall asleep during our lecture, but it was totally different to what I thought. All of them were fascinated by the idea of using enzymes and different <B>assemblies of biobricks</B> to create new functions, and interacted enthusiastically with us. For high school students, it is hard to imagine how scientists transfer genes into bacteria and plants. So we used some easy ways to explain how we do those jobs and we also designed some games to help them learn the basics of biobrick assembly. After this class, I think they gained a deeper understanding of synthetic biology. Hopefully through our iGEM introduction, they are inspired to become future iGEMers or even synthetic biologists.</P><P>

To further understand <B>the real practicability of our device</B>, we visited the Green Market in NTHU this summer. We had a good time interviewing with organic agriculture farmers. Through the interview, we could assess the feasibility of future development of our project as well. What's more, we designed <B>questionnaires</B> for farmers in green market in NTHU. The questionnaires were to publicize how our device works and we also learn from their advice.</P><DIV id="seemore8"><P>SEE MORE</P></DIV><DIV class="move8"><P>
　　After we visited the green market, we knew that pest plague is surely a big problem for them, especially for those who grow fruits and vegetables.
</P><P>In the end, we came to few conclusions : 
</P><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="I._Analysis">I. Analysis</SPAN></H5><P>
After a whole day of investigation, we listed 4 main problems required to be solved before our device hits the market:  
<B>1. Cost</B>
　　Pest traps are actually pretty low at price on the market. If we still use acrylic material, the entire device might not be as economical as we had predicted. Farmers suggested us switching to another kind of material such as PET or PP that are easier to make this device more competitive on the market. 
<B>2. Technical Training</B>
　　The working theory of our device is similar to pheromone traps.However, not every farmer has related experience. It’s necessary to simplify the steps to operate device. 
<B>3. Safety of Genetically Modified Products</B>
　　Although we are not growing GMO, some farmers still can’t hold a positive attitude toward our device since they reluctant to touch anything about gene modifying technique. So it’s not for sure whether our device would be accepted by the market in the future.
<B>4. Efficiency</B>
　　Wonderful as the idea may seem, our device still has to be more powerful than other pest traps on the market. 
</P><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="II._Achievements">II. Achievements</SPAN></H5><P>
　　One of the farmers indicated willingness to provide us with the targeted insects. Also many welcome us to test our device efficiency on their farmlands. For them, as long as our device does not contain any hazard pesticide or harm the environment, our project would be another good choice for them to solve pest plague.

We delivered a short presentation of our project and showed them our lab settings. As they have not yet established an iGEM team, they appeared intrigued by our demonstrations and were very keen to set up a team next year. Therefore, we made a further introduction of synthetic biology to them, and <B>shared them with our experiences in establishing an iGEM team</B>.
