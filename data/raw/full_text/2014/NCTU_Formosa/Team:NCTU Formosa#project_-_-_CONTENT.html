always greatly affect our daily life, and we donât have any appropriate solution to these troubling insects. Every year, harmful insects bring significant economic loss to agriculture, which seriously disturb people's livelihood and economy.  </P><P>Take Brazil as an example, where the <B>agricultural loss</B> can reach up to<B> 11 billion US dollars</B> because most economic crops here such as coconut, coffee, and sugarcane are under serious insects attack. To control these obnoxious insects, <B>1.4 billion</B> has to be invested to purchase insecticides annually. Terrible as it may seem, Brazil is just one of the many cases in the world! The truth is that farmers worldwide are doing the same thing! To ensure good harvest, they use <B>pesticides</B> without much consideration about its side effects. In other words, a great amount of insecticides containing <B>toxic substances</B> is discharged to the environment every day. Obviously, itâs never a good solution.   
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:816px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.1-1-1 Losses caused by pests in Brazil. This chart demonstrates the losses of various crops caused by pests.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Also, there is a data about the <B>IPM (Integrated pest management)</B> in USA.  Integrated pest management, which is defined as integration of pest control based on predicted economic, ecological and sociological consequences, makes maximum use of naturally occurring control agents, including weather, disease organisms, predators and parasites.In brief,IPM means the ability to control harmful insects.The lower the number is, the more efficient we are able to control the pests in the evaluated area. In the data, we can see that crops are planted in lots of areas in USA.There are several kinds of plants such as corn and soybean which suffer from insect damage. Since we can only control the insect damage efficiently within a small, limited area. Therefore, as the production areas expand to an extent, the effect of control declines exponentially. Even though the production areas become larger, the total production might be lower.</P><P>
Therefore, what we need is a brand new method to solve this problem. </P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:908px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.1-1-2  This chart demonstrates IPMs of the various areas of different crops planted in the USA.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Common_Solutions">Common Solutions</SPAN></H4><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Chemical_Control_Method">Chemical Control Method</SPAN></H5><P>
Because of insects damage, human tried lots of ways to kill these harmful insects. In the 15<SUP>th</SUP> century, people used pesticide containing <B>heavy metal</B> such as Arsenic, Mercury and Plumbum to kill harmful insects, which was a catastrophe to the environment. Pesticides became more powerful along with the development of modern technology. In the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, the agriculture prospered rapidly owing to the evolution of pesticides. But the pesticides are not only fatal to the insects but also harmful to the human body. People found this problem after several decades. The <B>toxin</B> of the pesticides will remain in creatures through the <B>food chain</B> and enter the <B>human body</B> eventually. </P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:402px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.1-2-1 Human health and environmental cost from pesticides in the United States is estimated at $9.6 billion.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P><B>Damage to Human Body</B></P><P> Pesticides includes herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and rodenticides, which will kill weeds, insects, fungus, rodents and others. In our project, we refer to insecticides as pesticides. The use of toxic pesticides to manage insect problems has become a common practice around the world. However, pesticides cause serious <B>human health hazards</B>, ranging from short-term impacts such as headaches and nausea to chronic impacts like cancer and reproductive harm. There are also many researches revealing that exposure to pesticides will disrupt the endocrine system, the reproductive system and embryonic development.</P><P><B>Damage to the Environment</B></P><P>Pesticides pollute the environment such as threatening <B>biodiversity</B> and <B>weakening the natural systems</B>. Pesticides have led to abnormally high mortality of America's honeybees. The population of bees has dropped by 29Â % to 36Â % each year since 2006. To our amazement, approximately 1/3 of the food we eat depends on bees for pollination!</P><P>Some scientists believe that amphibians and bats have become more susceptible to deadly diseases because their immune systems are weakened by pesticides. Pesticides also contaminate waterways and endangered fish and birds, causing <B>ecological damage</B>.</P><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Biological_Control_Method">Biological Control Method</SPAN></H5><P>Since most chemical control methods are poisonous to the environment, humans began to look for alternative solutions. One of the   best known example is bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which can efficiently kill insects with its crystal proteins. However, recent researches have shown that more and more insects have been <B>resistant</B> to this kind of protein.</P><P>Chemical control methods have caused fatal environmental damage and insects have grown resistant to both the chemicals substances and Bt. It is, however, not too late to improve this situation. We can create an agricultural revolution with our new method! </P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:482px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.1-2-2  Comparison of both solutions.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Pheromone trap is currently the most novel method to resolve insect damage problems. What's more, pheromone is a <B>pollution-free</B> substance that is produced by the insects, meaning that insects <B>cannot resist</B> it.  That's why we take biological synthesis of pheromone in <I>E.coli</I> to solve the problem. </P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_Pheromone_Trap">The Pheromone Trap</SPAN></H4><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Introduction_of_Pheromones">Introduction of Pheromones</SPAN></H5><P>A pheromone is a secreted or excreted chemical factor that triggers a <B>social response</B> among members of the <B>same species</B>. Pheromones are capable of acting outside the body of the secreting individual to impact the behavior of the receiving individuals. </P><P>There are many kinds of pheromones such as alarm pheromones, food trail pheromones, sex pheromones, and many others that affect behavior or physiology. </P><P>Sex pheromones are an important factor in finding a mating partner. When a female releases chemicals, the mating search is initiated, and the male moths begin their upwind motion toward their potential partner.

There are 2 main ways to produce pheromones. One through chemical synthesis, and the other through biosynthesis approach.
</P><P><B>Chemical Synthesis Approach Used in Factory for Massive Production</B></P><P>
It is <B>difficult</B> to make pheromone with a chemical synthesis approach. This approach requires many kinds of chemical compound which may cause <B>pollution</B> to the environment. Furthermore, the control of reacting condition may consume a lot of <B>energy</B>.

Once a PBAN binds with the<B> G-protein coupled receptor</B> located at an insectâs pheromone gland, it will send a signal to activate kinase and phosphatase, which in turn activates other enzymes that participate in the biosynthesis of insect sex pheromones.

First, we had to confirm whether an insect can take in vitro PBAN and allow it to function. From âPheromonotropic Activity of Naturally Occurring Pyrokinin Insect Neuropeptides (FXPR-Lamide) in <I>Helicoverpa zea</I>â<SUP>(37)</SUP>, this method has been proven possible. In this experiment, 0.05 pmol to 200 pmol of PBAN had been injected in to corn earworm and the amount of pheromone produced had been measured.  The result (Fig.1-2-4) showed that PBAN produced by insects itself can effectively increase the production of pheromone. The maximized amount of pheromone production was reached with only &quot;10 pmol&quot; of PBAN. This experiment means as long as <B>PBAN enters</B><B>the body of the insect</B>, it highly possible that<B> PBAN</B> can <B>stimulate the production of pheromone</B>.</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:454px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.3-1-1 Effect of dose of Hez-PBAN on stimulation in vivo pheromonotropic activity in vitrugin females of H. zea (bars indicate SEM. n=8).

In order to understand this problem, we searched some former papers and we found another paper from Peptides, âEnhanced oral availability/pheromonotropic activity of peptidase-resistant topical amphiphilic analogs of pyrokinin/PBAN insect neuropeptides<SUP>(36)</SUP> .â In this experiment, <I>Heliothis virescens</I> was the experimental insect and amphiphilic analogs of pyrokinin/PBAN were used instead of natural PBAN. This way, the analog can resist peptidase, as shown in the graph below. The amount of the natural PBAN decreases quickly while the analogs degrades slowly (Fig.3-2-1). However, we found the amphiphilic analogs of <B>pyrokinin/PBAN peptide</B> requires many special artificial modification, which means <I>E.coli</I> absolutely cannot produce this artificial PBAN that can easily resist peptidase. Thus, we need more brain storming to think of a way to use PBAN even if it may be degraded by peptidase.</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:452px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.3-2-1  Stability of the natural pyrokinin/PBAN analog LPK, and the peptidase-resistant pyrokinin/PBAN analogs Hex-Phe-Thr-Hyp-Trp-Gly-NH2 and Hex-Phe-Thr-Oic-Trp-Gly-NH2 to hydrolysis by peptidases bound to corn earworm (H. zea) Malpighian tubule tissue.

Although natural PBANs canât be maintained for a long time in mothâs body, we could solve this problem by simply <B>feeding moths</B> with <B>high concentration PBANs</B> continually.</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:452px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.3-3-1 Amount of pheromone, relative to the maximum pheromone amount induced by injected PBAN, produced by Hyp-analog and Oic-analog, 1.5, 3, 4, and 6h following oral administration.

This figure shows a very important information that blank (natural PBAN in low concentrationï¼50 pmol, the blank was measured when it was 2 hr after feeding with nature PBAN) still has some ability to stimulate pheromone production. Thus, we decided to try to feed the female target insects with high concentration PBAN continuously.(Ronald J. Nachmana, Peter E.A.

Then, there is a high possibility of PBAN being absorbed by the mothsâ body from the digestive system and succeed in stimulating the pheromone gland. Thus, if we feed the female insects with high concentration PBAN solution continuously, the female insects will produce pheromones for us, which theoretically solves the problem of PBAN's inability to maintain for a long time in the insectsâ body. As to how we produce PBAN and apply our concept to capture wanted harmful insects, we will explain in the following.</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="How_We_Are_Going_to_Use_PBAN.3F">How We Are Going to Use PBAN?</SPAN></H4><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:702px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.3-4-1  Overview of our project.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>In our project, we will biologically synthesize PBAN with the <I>E.coli</I>.

This is because the insects we don't want to catch will not be stimulated by PBAN to produce pheromone. Therefore, the PBAN is only for what we want to catch, and we are sure that our method won't affect other kinds of insects. </P><H6><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Reference_2">Reference</SPAN></H6><DIV class="ref"><OL start="35"><LI>Russell Jurenka, Insect Pheromone Biosynthesis, Topics in Current Chemistry (2004) 239: 97â 132

Therefore, we design a device that can be used in different conditions, which would allow farmers to choose the best way for their local condition.

   Since insects behave widely different to the gravity force, we design a device which could catch specific kinds of insect species that we want. For example, <I>Agrotis ypsilon</I> (Rottemberg) and <I>Spodoptera litura</I> fall into the kind of moth that have negative geotaxis <B>(antigravity, tendency to fly upwards)</B>. Thus, we made a trap with accessible pathway at the bottom. Once an insect enters the device, it could only go up and be trapped inside the pyramid. However, after field investigation, we found some insects still escape from the device. Then we came up with a new version trap with doubled layers, inner shell and outer shell.

Before the detailed description of how we design our device, we can show you a simple animation of the <B>assembling process</B> of our device.
As you can see, our device is very easy to use. Just assemble the outer shell, inner shell (containing PBAN) and tenons together to complete the device. Then, you can put the device at where you want to attract the harmful insects. </P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Mechanism_of_Attraction">Mechanism of Attraction</SPAN></H4><P>
As you can see, we divide our design into two partsï¼<B>exterior and interior</B>. The exterior is just like the appearance of a pyramid, and the interior is designed to accommodate PBAN. At the beginning of using the device, we turn on the blue light LEDs to attract the target harmful insects. When the target female insects are stuck in the interior and eat the food mixed with PBAN solution, they will release pheromones, and attract same-species counterparts. Even if we turn off the blue light, our device can attract many target male insects because the female insects inside our device is still in rut and releasing sex pheromone to attract their mates.
After the harmful insects go into our device, the design of our device will take advantage of their habit. Insects always <B>fly high to escape</B> so they will be <B>stuck in the top of our device</B>. </P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Device_Design">Device Design</SPAN></H4><P>More detail information about how we design our pyramidal device can downloaded in the file below.</P><UL class="download"><A href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByIV-UvWEH5cLXJrbnFtc014bHM/view" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Device_Design_Download</A></UL><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Process_to_Assemble_Our_Device_.26_Main_Idea_of_Our_Device_Design">Process to Assemble Our Device &amp; Main Idea of Our Device Design</SPAN></H4><P><B>Outer Shellï¼</B></P><TABLE width="100%;"><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:352px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.5-5-1 Outer shell real product.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD><TD><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:272px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Fig.5-5-2 Outer shell schematic diagram.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>

1. The outer shell is composed of 4 triangular acrylic planes which has a trapezoid entrance. When insects come inside and ingest PBAN solution, they will release pheromone.

ãSimilar to the outer one, the inner shell is also composed of 4 trapezoid planes and is removable from the base. The only difference  is that its top is not sealed so to allow entry of the captured insects.</P><P>
1. There would be a container of <B>PBAN</B> solution placed at the bottom. </P><P>
