Talk and poster at the jamboree. And everything else that concerns the perception of our project. The presentation group work ceaselessly to show the world, in the best light, what we've done.
Slide and Device Producing
KUAN-CHUN LAN made the stylish slides. He always modified the slides after every presentation practice. GUANG-JYUN WANG designed and built the amazing capturing device.
Initially, our team was divided into three groups for paper discussion and experiments. We hoped we could use these simple group division to make our teammates learn how to complete our teamwork.
One thing special about our team is that over 90% of us is freshmen. This made our team more creative but also presented many difficulties due to our relative lack of professional knowledge and training. Fortunately, we have many advisers to help us conquer these difficulties. They not only teach us the basic concepts and knowledge of iGEM, but they also let us think and try instead of doing the work for us. Therefore, our entire project is completed by our team members themselves with our instructors and advisers providing their opinions.
After a few months, we divided our team into experiment group, wiki group, art group, and presentation group in hopes of making everyone do what they do best.

Helena Lee
I am Helena, I want to be a biologist. This is my second year to join iGEM competition, I like to meet people from all over the world and try crazy ideas in the lab. I also draw figures for promoting our project.
CHAO-DI CHANG
Hello everyone, my name is Chao-Di Chang, and I am a master student from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan R.O.C. I am the modeling assistant of the 2014 NCTU_Formosa iGEM team. This is my first time being a member of iGEM team, cause my major is bioinformatics researching which is pretty far from synthetic biology and genetic engineering. However, the biological background of synthetic biology in iGEM is really easy to understand which means the idea of our project; the innovation is the most important thing in iGEM project. So all the iGEMers work really hard to perform their delicate biological device once a year, and I am so proud to be a part of it.
SHU-HAN CHANG
As a student majoring in biological science and technology of National Chiao-Tung University, I have the chance to join the competition. Although we have lots of problem to solve, but we never give up and finish the job. Since then, I love my partners so much. See the lab website
Chia-Ching Wu
My name is Chia-Ching Wu and I am one of the few older students from last year’s iGEM team who stayed to assist the new members. Although my job was only to assist, it felt really great after seeing the members improving and coming up with great ideas. Have fun while learning!
Po-Wei Chiang
I’m a Biotechnology major at NCTU. This is my second year as an iGEMer, for I was a team member in the 2013 NCTU_Formosa team, this year, as an advisor. At the moment, I'm assisting our team members conducting experiments and solving problems as well as training presentation. To me, iGEM is not only about winning prizes and honor, it’s about teamwork and friendship. That’s actually why I devote myself into iGEM again. Last but not least, I am thrilled about meeting all you OUTSTANDING people!
Ying-Ying Yu
My name is Ying-Ying. I’m a master student; studying in bioinformatics and synthetic biology.  I think iGEM competition is always a good place for synthetic biologists and students in the field. Additionally, they could develop their own creativities and potentials. We don’t focus our research on conventional organisms or mechanisms anymore. Synthetic biology brings us whole new way!
Yi-Tsao Chen
Hi, I am Yizao Chen. I was the member of 2013 NCTU_Formosa.  Now, I am the assitant of 2014 NCTU_Formosa. My major is biological science and I want to study biophysics in the future. I am in the lab of Bio-system simulation and do the analysis about protein sequence.
