Safety
All our team members received safety and operational training before working in the lab. This included training in good laboratory practice, waste disposal and the idiosyncchrasies of working in a hackspace lab. The appropriate personal protective equipment was used which included lab coats gloves and where necessary safety spectacles.
All work that was required to be carried out in a CL1 or greater environment took place in the labs of UCL Biochemical Engineering department. This work was overseen by a Safety Officer of the UCL Biochemical Engineering department. UK regulations were adhered to.
Work with Escherichia coli strain DH5-Alpha was considered low risk in accordance with classification from German TRBA as a Risk Group 1 organism.
Work with wild type Gluconacetobacter hansenii LMG1524 (ATCC 23769) was considered low risk in accordance with classification from German TRBA as a Risk Group 1 organism.
Additionally, our procedures for removing bacteria from cellulose products were informed by work done by iGEM 2014 team Imperial College London .
