The project!
uOttawa iGEM has a project of epic proportions in store for this year.
Let us take you through our creative and scientific process of building one of the most interesting proposed genetic networks — one that may shed light on how stem cells specialize and allow us to create similar behaviour in a lab.
Promoters
Eukaryotic, dual-input promoters.
See our yeast-optimized inducible and repressible promoters that we used in our network.
Results
Measurement
Interlab study
Biobricks
Modelling
How to explain tri-stability with math
Collaborating with Waterloo, we created different systems of differential equations to see if we can quantify how the tri-stable network behaves.
