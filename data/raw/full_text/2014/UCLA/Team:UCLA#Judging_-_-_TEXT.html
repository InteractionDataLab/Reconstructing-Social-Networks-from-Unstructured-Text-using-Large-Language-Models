Judging
Bronze Medal Requirements
✔ Register the team and have a great summer.
✔ Successfully complete and submit the iGEM 2014 Judging Form.
Our judging form can be found here
✔ Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
✔ Plan to present a poster and talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
✔ Distinguish work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
All attributions can be found on our wiki .
✔ Document at least one new standard BioBrick part or device used in your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
Thus far, we have submitted BBa_K1384000
Silver Medal Requirements
❏ Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick part or device of your own design and construction works as expected.
We will be validating our BioBrick soon! Stay tuned!
❏ Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry.
We will update our part's documentation as soon as possible.
✔ Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We have submitted BBa_K1384000
✔ iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.
We contemplated the responsibility that synthetic biologists have regarding the ethics of not only their own work, but their colleagues' work as well. Find our conclusion here on our Human Practices page .
Gold Medal Requirements
❏ Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part.
We will be characterizing a few Utah 2012 iGEM Teams in the upcoming weeks to compare them with our own constructs.
✓ Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
In collaboration with the Imperial iGEM team, we worked to revive the iGEM subreddit as an online forum for discussion and collaboration amongst iGEM teams.
Additionally, although they are not yet a registered iGEM team, we provided the University of LaVerne with advice and logistical support on how to begin their own iGEM team.
❏ iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team's scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.
Please refer to our Human Practices page to learn more about our involvement with ethics, safety, and security.
