DATA PAGE
Data for our favorite new parts
1. Main page - P70-csgA, wild-type csgA under control of the short curli promoter, BBa_K1404006. This part enables curli production, promoting biofilm formation.
2. Main page - P70-csgA-His, single His-tagged csgA under control of the short curli promoter, BBa_K1404007. This part enables curli production, promoting biofilm formation, and the single His tag improves nickel capture.
3. Main page - P70-csgA-His2, double His-tagged csgA under control of the short curli promoter, BBa_K1404008. This part enables curli production, promoting biofilm formation, and the double His tag further improves nickel capture compared to K1404007.
Data for pre-existing parts
1. Main page - P70, short curli promoter, BBa_K342000. We characterised the expression of the short curli promoter deposited on the registry and compared it with the full curli intergenic region.
We've also characterized the following parts
These parts are a continuation of the iGEM 2011 "Cobalt buster" project
1. Main page - Ptac-NiCoTB-rcn-csgBAEFG, device transforming E. coli into a nickel and cobalt biofilter, BBa_K1404001. This part increases the internalization of cobalt and nickel and promotes biofilm formation.
2. Main page - Ptac-NiCoTB, constitutive nickel and cobalt transporter generator, BBa_K1404002. This part increases the internalization of cobalt and nickel.
