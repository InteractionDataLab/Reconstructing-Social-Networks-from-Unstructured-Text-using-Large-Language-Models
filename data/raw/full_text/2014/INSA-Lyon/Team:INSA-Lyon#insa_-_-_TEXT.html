Alexia Vidal (INSA)
Undergraduate student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA Lyon, I provided support for the 2013 European Jamboree organization. This experience has really motivated me to participate at the 2014 iGEM adventure! I’ve loved working this summer with our bacteria but especially with all the INSA Lyon team members. Moreover, I’ve been in charge of the project budget management. Outside the school, I enjoy scuba-diving, playing the flute in a harmony orchestra, running, playing golf, going out with friends and travelling. I look forward to meeting you all in Boston!
Romain Tching Chi Yen (INSA)
Now fourth year student in modelisation and bio-computing, I'm the waffle master of the team. Though not the most efficient, I'm dedicated to my work and spent and incredible summer with everyone working on this project. My contribution to the team was mainly with the mathematical model (no, I swear I'm nice, don't run away!) and human practice work, but I also helped in the wetlab for the clonig period, as well as whenever help was needed, be it for an experiment, making solutions, washing instruments, filling pipette tips boxes, etc. I could do everything. Kind of like a super hero... Yes, you may refer to me as WaffleMan!
Africa Smith de Diego (INSA)
I am a 5th year student of Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon, graduating in a few months. I decided to join INSA Lyon iGEM team in order to have a look at what research is and work in a biotechnology project and it was way better than expected! This experience has shown me the wonders and the possibilities of synthetic bio and has motivated me to be a researcher in the future.
During the summer, I was specially in charge of the cloning period, characterization tests and the final experiences on nickel chelation. Also, I participated in the iGEM France meet up and had a great time with the other iGEMers!
In my free time, I like travelling, going to concerts, dance and practice sports.
Adam Amara (Lyon 1)
Final year student in BSc of Biochemistry at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1. I am interested in Synthetic Biology and the possibility to solve current problems in our society. The iGEM seems to be the best way to discover the world of synthetic biology,  and getting involved in a great project with real solutions and a real impact like the project Curly'on. I have been in charge of the Nickel tests, but I was also available to help my mates in the lab for other tasks, for the iGEM you must be MULTI-TASK ! I'm passioned by technologies, open science, DIY, rowing, cinema and Science Fiction (Dr Who!).
Alice Le Boedec (INSA)
Based on my interest for biology as undergraduate student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon, I started putting a lot into the school association “DNA Concept Club”. I was in charge of communication and my goal was to promote synthetic biology. Then I heard about the IGEM competition  and I felt naturally attracted!  Let's talk about this amazing experience... Surnamed “miss bacteria killer”, I was all the summer especially in charge of degrading biofilms and bacterian DNA before their use in the biofilter. For the human practice part, I organized visits at the purification station and the dialysis center. Liking art in general, I was pleased to write some lyrics for our clip Plasmidoutai as well as to be the photographer of the team ! One last point : I took part in the French IGEM meetup, from which I have a lot of good memories !
Benjamin Rémy (INSA)
I am a fifth year in biochemistry and biotechnology but must of all I am passionate by biology and all its applications. People talks a lot of the progress on phones or computer but It is really amazing what now we can do with just bacteria and designed DNA molecules. That why I have done the iGEM. Furthermore, the iGEM kicks you out of your classic lab work to give you the opportunity to design your own experiment. Indeed, during the summer, my big job was to search, adapt, work on and sometimes create protocols for the characterisation our modified curli and also for its chelating power. That makes the iGEM a really funny and creative experience. Finally, the best part, the summer lab work allow me to dance and sing during the experiments...Oh that explain we had a rainy summer !!

Juliette Paillet (INSA)
I am a 4th year student in Biochemistry and biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. I was a volunteer for the organization of the European Jamboree in Lyon in September 2013, and this made me want to participate to the iGEM competition as a student. I started my iGEM activities with the association “INSA AND Concept Club” and was in charge of the administrative side of the project. In the lab I participated in cloning and curli characterization. That was a great new experience and very educational. I loved working with all the team during the summer and had a lot of fun !
Except my passion for synthetic biology ;) I also like drawing and running.  I am very exiting about this Giant Jamboree and can’t wait to meet all the iGEMers.

Viviane Chansavang (INSA Alumna)
iGEM 2011, 2012, 2013 and... 2014? I guess we can call it dedication...or is it addiction?
I graduated from INSA de Lyon in September 2013, worked hard in the organizing committee of the Europe Regional Jamboree in October 2013, and then traveled across the planet to sunny Southern California for my first job. Although I traded in the bench for a desk, I'm still showing support to my home team. Working at the Office for Science and Technology of the Embassy of France in the US, I am striving at fostering partnerships between French and American labs in the field of life sciences.
Valérie Forest (EMSE)
Graduated in Biologic and Medical Engineering, I am assistant Professor at Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Etienne. I especially work in the field of nanotechnologies, but our engineering school is also highly interested in the development of synthetic biology and strongly believes in its outstanding applications. The iGEM competition gives us the opportunity to work in close collaboration with other regional and international institutions in a very interdisciplinary field. This exceptional experience is highly interesting, motivating and rewarding for students and advisors both on scientific and human aspects.
INSTRUCTORS
Yoann Louis (INSA)
Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon and coordinator of the 2014 iGEM INSA-LYON Team. Up to now my work is mainly to study trace metals / organic matter behavior in various environment and to give an expertise on their potential toxicity depending on the bio-physico-chemical conditions of the studied site. I'm also now working on metal and biological material interaction in order to found new way to treat human waste. As a chemist, my interest in the iGEM project is to have an interdisciplinary approach of the project and not only a biological approach.
Corinne Dorel-Flamant (INSA)
My teaching activities in the Microbial Genetics mainly take place within the Biosciences department at INSA Lyon, but also at the Ecole Normale Supérieur de Lyon and at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.
My research work is based on the understanding of genetic mechanisms involved in the formation of biofilms and the contamination of materials. Being the Communications officer for the Biosciences department, my participation in iGEM is part of a strategy to promote and share knowledge in the field of research in genetic engineering and more generally in Biological Sciences.
Agnès Rodrigue (INSA)
As an associate professor I find that iGEM is an unique experience, a place to mix teaching and practice in a long term project relying on students’ motivation. My teaching interests are microbiology, molecular biology, protein engineering and bioinformatics.
My research topic focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in bacterial adaptation to a metal-rich environment, from molecular interactions to population biology. Apart from the basic approaches, this subject offers also the opportunity to develop biological tools for the bioremediation of spoiled environment or the in situ detection of toxic compounds for instance, developments which I’m interested in. My motivation for iGEM is the same: conception and application.
Marie-Pierre Escudié (INSA)
PhD in Political Science ("Gaston Berger, les sciences humaines et les sciences de l'ingénieur, un projet de réforme de la société", Université Lumière Lyon 2, December 2013). I'm presently a Research engineer at INSA Lyon, i studie how politics, culture, and ethics of engineer shape science and technology.
Marianne Chouteau (INSA)
Marianne Chouteau has a PhD in Communication Science ("Les intentions vulgarisatrices : études d'ouvrage de vulgarisation scientifique de 1686 aux années 1950, Université Paris 7, Ed du Septentrion, 2000) . Researcher and professor in Humanities Center at INSA de Lyon, she studies the representation of science and technology in communication such as "cop and lab" series (CSI or Bones), movies, novels...
Valérie Desjardin (INSA)
Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon My research work at the Laboratory of Civil engineering and Environmental engineering (LGCIE) is currently aimed at the study of biophysicochemical interactions of pollutants in various compounds (soils, sediments, municipal solid waste) using molecular biology tools. I am very excited to take part in the iGEM project which leads to the development of a synergy, already launched, between the Biosciences department and Environmental sciences.
Alexandre Duprey (Lyon 1)
PhD student at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, I'm back for a fourth year of iGEM ! This time as an instructor, I'm excited to see entirely new aspects of an iGEM project, and experimenting teaching in an unusual and rather unique way.
Apart from iGEM, I'm preparing a thesis on the regulation of the virulence of the phytopathogen Dickeya dadantii. You know, complex stuff involving 5 different proteins, 2 promoters and DNA supercoiling acting simultaneously on a single gene... Still, I hope my experience with genetic regulation, reporters and data analysis prove useful to the team.
Emiel van der Kouwe (Pharmacist and biologist)
Pharmacist and graduated in Systems and Synthetic Biology, my first experience with the iGEM competition was in 2013 in Evry where we designed iron-chelating bacteria as an alternative treament to hemochromatosis. The experience was intense, albeit very addictive. Since I'm back in my hometown, I'm doing this all over again but this time as a supervisor at the INSA-Lyon. My favorite experience so far is teasing Juliette Paillet and testing her mental toughness through the summer.
