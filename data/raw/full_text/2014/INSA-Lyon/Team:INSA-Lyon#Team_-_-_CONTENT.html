This experience really motivated me to participate in the 2014 iGEM adventure!
I loved working this summer with our bacteria but especially with all the INSA Lyon team members. Moreover, I was in charge of the project budget management.
Outside of school, I enjoy scuba-diving, playing the flute in a harmony orchestra, running, playing golf, going out with friends and traveling.
I look forward to meeting you all in Boston!</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Romain Tching Chi Yen (INSA)</B><P>Now fourth year student in Bioinformatics and Modelling, I'm the waffle master of the team. Though not the most efficient, I'm dedicated to my work and spent an incredible summer with everyone working on this project. My contribution to the team was mainly with the mathematical model (no, I swear I'm nice, don't run away!) and human practice work, but I also helped in the wetlab for the cloning period, as well as whenever help was needed, be it for an experiment, making solutions, washing instruments, filling pipette tips boxes, etc. I could do everything. Kind of like a super hero... Yes, you may refer to me as WaffleMan!</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Africa Smith de Diego (INSA)</B><P>I am a 5th year student of Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon, graduating in a few months. I decided to join INSA Lyon iGEM team in order to have a look at what research is and work in a biotechnology project and it was way better than expected! This experience has shown me the wonders and the possibilities of synthetic bio and has motivated me to be a researcher in the future.</P><P>During the summer, I was specifically in charge of the cloning period, characterization tests and the final experiences on nickel chelation. Also, I participated in the iGEM France meet up and had a great time with the other iGEMers!</P><P>In my free time, I like traveling, going to concerts, dance and practice sports.</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Adam Amara (Lyon 1)</B><P>Final year student in BSc of Biochemistry at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1. I am interested in Synthetic Biology and the possibility to solve current problems in our society. The iGEM seems to be the best way to discover the world of synthetic biology,  and getting involved in a great project with real solutions and a real impact like the project Curly'on. 
I have been in charge of the Nickel tests, but I was also available to help my mates in the lab for other tasks, for the iGEM you must be MULTI-TASK !
I'm passionate about technologies, open science, DIY, rowing, cinema and Science Fiction (Dr Who!).</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Alice Le Boedec (INSA)</B><P>Based on my interest for biology as an undergraduate student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon, I started putting a lot into the school association “DNA Concept Club”. I was in charge of communication and my goal was to promote synthetic biology. Then I heard about the iGEM competition  and I felt naturally attracted! 
Let's talk about this amazing experience... Nicknamed “miss bacteria killer”, I was all the summer especially in charge of degrading biofilms and bacterial DNA before their use in the biofilter. For the human practice part, I organized visits at the purification station and the dialysis center. Liking art in general, I was pleased to write some lyrics for our clip Plasmidoutai as well as to be the photographer of the team ! One last point : I took part in the French iGEM meetup, from which I have a lot of good memories !</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Benjamin Rémy (INSA)</B><P>I am a fifth year in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies but must of all I am passionate about biology and all its applications. People talk a lot of the progress on phones or computers but it is really amazing what we can do now with just bacteria and designed DNA molecules. That's why I have done iGEM. Furthermore, iGEM kicks you out of your classic lab work to give you an opportunity to design your own experiment. Indeed, during the summer, my big job was to search, adapt, work on and sometimes create protocols for the characterization of our modified curli and also for its chelating power. That makes iGEM a really funny and creative experience. Finally, the best part, the summer lab work allowed me to dance and sing during experiments...Oh that explains why we had a rainy summer !!</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Chloé Marquet--Jouve (INSA)</B><P>I am a fourth year student at INSA de Lyon, in the biochemistry and biotechnologies department. I discovered the iGEM competition last year, during the European Jamboree in Lyon and I immediately adhered to the concept, for the scientific aspect as well as the human one. I wanted to join the iGEM team in order to work in a multidisciplinary environment on an project which is combining biology and technology into a product.
First of all, I have loved working with all of my fellows. I’ve learnt a lot from each of them, and enjoy all these moments spent together, during this summer : cheering each other in the bad times as partying in the good ones.
During my leisure time, I play soccer on the INSA team, that’s why I’ve particularly enjoyed our cloning-and-world-cup nights :)
</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Yang Zhang (INSA)</B><P>Typical Chinese guy with a super power of mental calculation. Don't like to sing or any kind of physical activities. Problem is, this guy is also crazy about biology. So if you see him working in front of a messy lab bench without saying a word all day long, don't be surprised. What else you should know, let me think, let me think...Oh right, he has also written the script of the project presentation video. So I guess he's also a prestige guy. Isn't that annoying?</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Juliette Paillet (INSA)</B><P>I am a 4th year student in Biochemistry and biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. I was a volunteer for the organization of the European Jamboree in Lyon in September 2013, and this made me want to participate to the iGEM competition as a student. I started my iGEM activities with the association “INSA AND Concept Club” and was in charge of the administrative side of the project. In the lab I participated in cloning and curli characterization. That was a great new experience and very educational. I loved working with all the team during the summer and had a lot of fun !
Except my passion for synthetic biology ;) I also like drawing and running. 
I am very exiting about this Giant Jamboree and can’t wait to meet all the iGEMers.</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Madalina Cercel (INSA)</B><P>Being a volunteer in the 2013 European Jamboree gave me the opportunity to discover the iGEM Competition and the motivation to be part of this year’s team. Although a 4th year student at INSA Lyon in Bioinformatics and Modeling, I spent all the summer in the lab. And I loved every single moment of it! My work consisted especially in developing protocols, test and improve them, but I took part, as the rest of us, in the long late cloning hours.

This project has been a great experience for me. It allowed me to get closer to the research field and showed me that this is the path I want to follow in the future.

I spend my free time doing all kind of sports: skiing, playing tennis, biking, but I also enjoy travelling, reading and watching movies.</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Thomas Cruzel(EMSE)</B><P>Student at the &quot;École des mines de Saint-Étienne&quot; school, the iGEM project was an opportunity for me to discover team work. As I'm more interested in computers than in biology, during this project I worked mainly on the modelling of curli formation and nickel chelation.</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Alice Blot (DSAA Design Interactif, Villefontaine)</B><P>I am studying interactive design in Master degree and the link between design and science captivates me. I am passionate by these two fields. I had to make a choice…. and I chose Design. Although, as soon as possible, I combine them. 
I know the iGEM thanks to Juliette. She asked me to design their wiki. I accepted immediately !
Even though I don’t understand very well fine details, I note curli are great !</P></DIV></LI></UL><LI><A href="#advisors" onclick="$('#advisors').slideToggle('slow')"><H1>ADVISORS</H1></A></LI><UL id="advisors" style="list-style-type: none !important;display:none;"><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Nicolas Comte (INSA)</B><P>Dinosaur of the team engineering student in Bioinformatics, I have a bachelor degree in Biology and modelisation. Synthetic Biology is an interesting subject that I've never heard of before. Naturally, with my curiosity, I help the INSA-Lyon team in modeling, infography and mostly with puns, to discover and practice in this incredible universe !</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Pedro Da Silva (INSA)</B><P>Associate professor at INSA de LYON, I'm a structural biologist.

I am specially interested in 3D Printers, that is the reason why I was asked to participate to the iGEM project.
I agreed with pleasure  because I like working with students on such interdisciplinary projects.
I think it is important that students know 3D printers technologies because 3D Printers will provide many opportunities in several domains in the next 10 or 20 years and the iGEM project is an example for this.
Otherwise I like to play tennis, to ski and to walk in mountain, and also to cook french food with my family and my friends ! </P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Benoît Drogue (Lyon 1 Alumnus)</B><P>Young Microbiologist, I'm a dreamer with a scientific heart... everything you need to succeed in iGEM competition.</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Viviane Chansavang (INSA Alumna)</B><P>iGEM 2011, 2012, 2013 and... 2014? I guess we can call it dedication...or is it addiction?
I graduated from INSA de Lyon in September 2013, worked hard in the organizing committee of the Europe Regional Jamboree in October 2013, and then traveled across the planet to sunny Southern California for my first job. Although I traded in the bench for a desk, I'm still showing support to my home team. Working at the Office for Science and Technology of the Embassy of France in the US, I am striving to foster partnerships between French and American labs in the field of life sciences.</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Valérie Forest (EMSE)</B><P>Graduated in Biologic and Medical Engineering, I am assistant Professor at Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Etienne. I especially work in the field of nanotechnologies, but our engineering school is also highly interested in the development of synthetic biology and strongly believes in its outstanding applications. The iGEM competition gives us the opportunity to work in close collaboration with other regional and international institutions in a very interdisciplinary field. This exceptional experience is highly interesting, motivating and rewarding for students and advisors both on scientific and human aspects.</P></DIV></LI></UL><LI><A href="#instructors" onclick="$('#instructors').slideToggle('slow')"><H1>INSTRUCTORS</H1></A></LI><UL id="instructors" style="list-style-type: none !important;display:none;"><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Yoann Louis (INSA)</B><P>Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon and coordinator of the 2014 iGEM INSA-LYON Team.
Up to now my work was mainly to study trace metals / organic matter behavior in various environment and to give an expertise on their potential toxicity depending on the bio-physico-chemical conditions of the studied site. I'm also currently working on metal and biological material interaction in order to find new way to treat human waste. As a chemist, my interest in the iGEM project is to have an interdisciplinary approach of the project and not only a biological approach.</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Corinne Dorel-Flamant (INSA)</B><P>My teaching activities in the Microbial Genetics mainly take place within the Biosciences department at INSA Lyon, but also at the Ecole Normale Supérieur de Lyon and at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.
My research work is based on the understanding of genetic mechanisms involved in the formation of biofilms and the contamination of materials. Being the Communications officer for the Biosciences department, my participation in iGEM is part of a strategy to promote and share knowledge in the field of research in genetic engineering and more generally in Biological Sciences.</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Agnès Rodrigue (INSA)</B><P>As an associate professor I find that iGEM is a unique experience, a place to mix teaching and practice in a long term project relying on students’ motivation. My teaching interests are microbiology, molecular biology, protein engineering and bioinformatics.
My research topic focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in bacterial adaptation to a metal-rich environment, from molecular interactions to population biology. Apart from the basic approaches, this subject offers also the opportunity to develop biological tools for the bioremediation of spoiled environment or the in situ detection of toxic compounds for instance, developments which I’m interested in. My motivation for iGEM is the same: conception and application.</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Marie-Pierre Escudié (INSA)</B><P>PhD in Political Science (&quot;Gaston Berger, les sciences humaines et les sciences de l'ingénieur, un projet de réforme de la société&quot;, Université Lumière Lyon 2, December 2013).

My research work at the Laboratory of Civil engineering and Environmental engineering (LGCIE) is currently aimed at the study of biophysicochemical interactions of pollutants in various compounds (soils, sediments, municipal solid waste) using molecular biology tools. I am very excited to take part in the iGEM project which leads to the development of a synergy, already launched, between the Biosciences department and Environmental sciences.</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Alexandre Duprey (Lyon 1)</B><P>PhD student at Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, I'm back for a fourth year of iGEM ! This time as an instructor, I'm excited to see entirely new aspects of an iGEM project, and experimenting teaching in an unusual and rather unique way.
Apart from iGEM, I'm preparing a thesis on the regulation of the virulence of the phytopathogen <I>Dickeya dadantii</I>. You know, complex stuff involving 5 different proteins, 2 promoters and DNA supercoiling acting simultaneously on a single gene... Still, I hope my experience with genetic regulation, reporters and data analysis prove useful to the team.</P></DIV></LI><LI><DIV align="center"><B>Emiel van der Kouwe (Pharmacist and biologist)</B><P>Freshly graduated as a pharmacist but also in Systems and Synthetic Biology, I had the unique opportunity of coordinating the Evry iGEM team 2013. The experience was intense and stressful, albeit very addictive and rewarding. Back in my hometown, I met the organizers of the Lyon Jamboree 2013 and joined their 2014 team as a supervisor. My favorite experience so far is to tease Juliette Paillet and push her mental toughness to the limit. I sincerely hope this team will go through the same experience as I did.
