Every now and then, our team felt that it's time to get out of the lab and have some fun. And what better than a walk in the biopole of Gerland in Lyon, our city, the one that inspired us to choose our project's name: CurLy'on.
Our level of enthusiasm kept us together even in the late cloning nights...
...or the hard-working days.
We enjoyed facing the difficulties, the unknown and the emotions every step of the way. Our best weapons: the smile, the good-mood and the desire to do greatness...
And of course, some "girl power" always got the job done :)
And when the job was finally done, we knew only one thing: it was the time for celebration
After all this work, the results followed in no time
