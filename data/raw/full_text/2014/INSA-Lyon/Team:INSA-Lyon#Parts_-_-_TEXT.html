5 biobricks have been constructed, thre for Nickel chelation, two for promoter characterization.
Biobricks for nickel chelation
The principal of the construction is shown in the figure below.
On a pSB1C3 backbone, two essential part have been assembled: a promoter and a reporter coding for CsgA.The promoter in this case is always the same: P70.However, the reporter is different for each construction. The first CsgA is called CsgA WT, the sequence is exactly the same as we found in a wild type CsgA protein except one mutation in order to eliminate one restriction site. The construction is also called CsgA-WT. The second CsgA is based on the same sequence but with a short sequence coding for a his tag(a peptide chain coding six histidines). This construction is called CsgA-His1. The last CsgA is almost the same but with 2 his tag. This construction is called CsgA-His2.
