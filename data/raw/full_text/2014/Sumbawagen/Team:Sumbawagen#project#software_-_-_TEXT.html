Software
Not everybody knows how to measure  glucose concentration in honey. Our team found the best way to apply our project, by creating a device that capable to measure the glucose concentration in honey. To ease people use the device, we create a simple software, which is cheap and easy to use
ECONEY Project is a colaboration between biotechnology and informatics technology. We createECONEYsoftwarebased on android smartphone technology, which can be used to measure glucose concentration using catabolite repression phenomenon. ECONEY software will detect RGB value and color code from single picture captured from smartphone camera.Then the RGB Luminance value will be calculated using the RGB Value detected earlier and the result showed on screen directly.Our software has graphics submenu which provide you with the standard curve. This curve is used to calculate the glucose concentration of honey.
