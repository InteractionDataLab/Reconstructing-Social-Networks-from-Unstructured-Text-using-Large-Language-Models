Notebook – Protocol – 14. Measurement
1. Overnight culture of “main culture” was taken from the shaker, then put in rack for measurement.
2. First, picture was taken with pocket camera.
3. Then color of the medium was measured its RGB value by ColorMeter program from an android-base mobile phone. For each side, 3 pictures were shot.
4. For validation, another mobile phone with different resolution of camera was used. Also besides, ColorMeter, we also used different program for RGB measurement namely Color Detector.
5. Values of RGB were converted to luminance value to obtain only the brightness of color (http://www.scantips.com/lumin.html; accessed on Sep. 24th, 2014). The formula used is: Luminance value = (R x 0.30) + (G x 0.59) + (B x 0.11)
6. Luminance values from 3 RGB data were averaged and calculated its standard deviation.
