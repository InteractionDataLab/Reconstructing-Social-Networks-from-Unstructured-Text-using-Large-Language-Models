A. Team Discussion
Policy and practices is a way for us to introduce our project to society. We discussed our policy and practices project first on June 23, 2014. The points of our discussion were determining our survey targets and making questionnaire design. After we shared our best ideas for the project, we decided the purpose of the project which is to introduce ECONEY to Sumbawa society and to discover more information about everything related to Sumbawa honey. Because of our questionnaire design was still not complete, we had another disscussions then we report to our instructors to get the revisions. The problems were about the question complexity and its relation to the project. And finally, our questionnaire finished on July 6th.
The next discussion was about the respondents. We determined the region target and the number of the respondents. We devided the respondents in honey production regions. We divided the respondents into producers, distributors, and consumers. We targetted to have 630 respondents which consist of 210 producers, 210 distributors, and 210 consumers using random sampling design.
B. Idea
We surveyed 16 regions consist of 7 producer regions and 9 consumer regions, while the distributors were exist in both of the areas. The producer regions located in villages. On the other hand, we choose Sumbawa Besar (the capital city of Sumbawa regency) as consumer regions. Sumbawagen team then divided into 7 teams to do the survey. Each team did the survey at 1 producer regions and 1 consumer regions. The survey was held on July 14-17 2014.
C. Data Analysis
We would like to give our gratitude to all Sumbawa society that had been participated in our policy and practices project. There are 672 respondents which consist of 130 producers, 71 distributors, and 471 consumers participated in the project. The data analysis were given below:
1. Have you ever consume Sumbawa honey?
Most of our respondents have consumed Sumbawa honey. It shows that Sumbawa honey is a very important commodity for Sumbawa society.
2. Is there any tools which can be used to measure glucose level in Sumbawa honey?
Many of our respondents said they don’t know the tools to measure the glucose level in Sumbawa honey.
3. If the answer for no. 2 is YES, please mention the tools
None of our respondents could mention the tool used to measure glucose level in Sumbawa honey.
Although some of our respondents said that there is a tool exist to measure glucose in Sumbawa honey, they couldn’t mention the name. After interviewed them little bit deeper we figured out that society has perception that the tool is the same with the tool used to measure water level, but the fact it's different. If they want to know glucose level in Sumbawa honey (especially the distributor) they have to send honey sample to Mataram (the capital city of West Nusa Tenggara province).
4. If there is a tool created to measure the glucose level in honey, how would you respond?
The society gave the positive response for this question. Most of producers want to use (58%), and just 7% didn’t care about it. The distributor respondents who want to learn and use the tool are almost same (47% and 46%). Meanwhile, most of the consumers want to learn (53%).
5. Are you android smartphone user?
In Sumbawa society, android smartphone is familiar among teens. Hence in the survey, only a small number of respondents using android smartphone: producer is only 29%, distributor is only 15%, and the consumer is only 30%.
6. If the answer of question number 5 is “YES”, are you using android smartphone application?
Most of android user use android aplication beacuse there are various and cheap applications in android market, even some are distributed for free.
7. If the answer is “YES” for question number 6, is android smartphone application easy to use?
All of our producer respondents agree if android smartphone applications are easy to use. Whereas 40% from our distributor respondents and 5% from consumer respondents said that the applications are difficult to use.
8. If the application can meassure glucose level in honey, what is your response?
Our respondents were very interest with our project especially for producer and distributor category as show from the survey result.
9. As sumbawa people, are you proud of Sumbawa honey?
We can conclude that Sumbawa people are absolutely proud of Sumbawa honey. Sumbawa honey is the icon of Sumbawa.
Conclusion
Sumbawa honey as the icon of Sumbawa contains high glucose level. However, there is no tools for measuring glucose concentration exist in Sumbawa. That's why people of Sumbawa they really appreciate our ECONEY project. We hope our ECONEY project could be applied to help people in Sumbawa measure glucose level in honey.
