Moyo Festival
Moyo festival is an annual Sumbawa citizen festival held every year. This year the festival held from September 27th - October 6th, 2014 at Pahlawan Square of Sumbawa Besar and Moyo Island. This festival is eagerly awaited by the people of Sumbawa and even attract domestic and international tourist. People gather to get some fun and to learn about Sumbawa culture.
On the third night (September 29 2014) we got the opportunity to introduce synthetic biology and Sumbawagen project to the society because our project is related to Sumbawa honey. We also present some photos of Sumbawagen team activities and introduce some of the tools that we have such as PCR, micropipette, microscope, etc. Visitors were taking turn asking questions in the middle of the crowd that night. We hope that after this event the public will have better understand of synthetic biology and tools related to synthetic biology, to improve knowledge of Sumbawa society.
