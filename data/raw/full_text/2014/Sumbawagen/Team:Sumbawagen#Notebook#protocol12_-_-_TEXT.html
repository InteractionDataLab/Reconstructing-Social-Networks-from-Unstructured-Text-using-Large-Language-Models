Notebook – Protocol – 12. Honey glucose meter measurement
1. Glucose dissolved in distilled water to a concentrations of 100 mM was used as stock. From that stock, various concentration of glucose were prepared by dilution. The concentrations were 5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 mM.
2. Those glucose stocks were measured its mg/dl value by a glucose meter. The values then plotted as y axis, against the concentration as x axis. Linear standard curve was obtained and the formula was used to calculate the concentration of unknown sample.
3. Honey in 1.5 ml polypropylene tube was warmed at 60 oC for 10 minutes, then transferred 100 ul to a new tube which contained 900 ul distilled water to obtain 1/10 dilution.
4. This sample was used for measurement of glucose concentration by glucose meter, and its glucose concentration was calculated using standard curve obtained before.
5. When the mg/dl value still exceeded the linear curve, dilution rate was increased.
