Notebook – Protocol – 8. Transformation (Heat Shock)
Protocols from the kit were followed by adaptation because we have no high speed micro centrifuge, but only a 6,000 rpm small micro centrifuge
1.  Add plasmid into tubes containing E. coli competent cell.
2.  Mix by pipetting using micropipette (5-10 times pipetting).
3.  Incubate at 4 °C for 40 minutes (inside a refrigerator).
4.  Prepare the hot water with the temperature of 42 °C, measure the temperature using thermometer.
5.  Heat shock the cells by put the bottom of the tube on hot water for 45 seconds.
6.  Incubate at 4 °C for 5 minutes.
7.  Add 1 ml LB liquid medium sterile (without antibiotic) into each tubes.
8.  Incubate using shaker for 2 hours
9.  Plating the transformation by add 100 µl transformation reaction to LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol (final   concentration 50 µg/ml).
10. Give label for the plates.
11. Centrifuge for 6,000 rpm for 3 minutes.
12. Discard the flow-through as much as 700 µl.
13. Suspend the remaining flow-through and pellets by pipetting.
14. Add 100 µl to agar plate containing appropriate antibiotic.
15. Give label for the plates.
16. Incubate at 37 °C overnight.
17. Check the result later.
