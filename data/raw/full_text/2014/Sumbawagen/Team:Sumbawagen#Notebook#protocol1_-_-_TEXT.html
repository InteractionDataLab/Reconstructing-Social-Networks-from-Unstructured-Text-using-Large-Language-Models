Notebook – Protocol – 1. Primer design
1.DNA sequence of E.coli adenylate cyclase (cyaA; accession code NC_000913 REGION: 3991153..3993699; 2547 bp) and E. coli IIA(Glc) (crr; accession code J02796; 510 bp) were obtained from Genebank http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
2.Both DNA sequences were checked for the “in availability” of restriction sites of EcoRI (G^AATT_C), XbaI (T^CTAG_A), SpeI (A^CTAG_T), and PstI  (C_TGCA^G) by Bioedit program using menu: Sequence/Nucleic Acid/Restriction Map/Generate Map.
3. Forward primers were designed to contain (from 5’ direction) :
additional sequence to accommodate restriction enzyme recognition; TTA
sequence from backbone pSB1C3 which has both EcoRI and XbaI sites; GAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGA
seven codons of the initial part of the genes which include start codon
4. Reverse primers were designed to contain (from 5’ direction) :
additional sequence to accommodate restriction enzyme recognition; TTA
sequence from backbone pSB1C3 which has SpeI site; ACTAGTA
double stop codon (in reverse complement sequence); TTATTA
six codons of the last part of the genes (in reverse complement sequence)
For cyaA, besides the last part of the genes which codes for full length sequence, other reverse primer was also designed to contain the last part of N-terminal catalytic domain (full length sequence, 2547 bp; N-terminal catalytic domain, 1605 bp)
Resulted primers sequences were as follow
cyaA full length forward primer (primer name “ACEF”)
5’-TTA GAA TTC GCG GCC GCT TCT AGA TGT ACC TCT ATA TTG AGA CTC TG-3’
cyaA catalytic domain reverse primer (primer name “ACER1”)
5’-TTA ACT AGT ATT ATT ATT CCG AGA GAT CGG GTG AAA T-3’
cyaA full length reverse primer (primer name “ACER2”)
5’-TTA ACT AGT ATT ATT ACG AAA AAT ATT GCT GTA ATA G-3’
crr forward primer (primer name “AEF”)
5’-TTA GAA TTC GCG GCC GCT TCT AGA TGG GTT TGT TCG ATA AAC TG-3’
crr reverse primer (primer name “AER”)
5’-TTA ACT AGT ATT ATT ACT TCT TGA TGC GGA TAA C-3’
