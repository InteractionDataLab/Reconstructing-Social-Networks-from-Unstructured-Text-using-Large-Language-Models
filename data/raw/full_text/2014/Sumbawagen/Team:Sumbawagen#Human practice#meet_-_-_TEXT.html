Meet US Ambassador
Mr. Robert Blake (US Ambassador for Indonesia) invited our team to meet up at the US Embassy, Jakarta. We got invited because he was interest with our ECONEY project since we aim to help the sustainability of Sumbawa Honey. Our Rector and our Dean shares the possibility of developing synthetic biology in eastern of Indonesia, and the ambassador offer his help as the cooperation from government to government. This results makes us very excited.
