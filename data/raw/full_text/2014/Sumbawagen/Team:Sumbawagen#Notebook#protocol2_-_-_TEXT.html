Notebook – Protocol – 2.PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
1. Ordered primers were dissolved in 1x TE buffer to get a 100 uM stock, then diluted to 10 uM stock by 1x TE buffer (usually to final volume of 200 ul). Primers stocks were stored at -20 °C.
2. There were 3 pairs of primers for the PCR namely
ACEF/ACER1 to clone catalytic domain sequence of adenylate cyclase gene
AEF/AER to clone full length sequence of IIA(Glc) gene
3. Reagents compositions for PCR were as follow:
2X PCR master mix (Thermoscientific),  25 ul
Sterilized distilled water (Akuabides),  15 ul
10 uM forward primer,    5 ul
10 uM reverse primer,    5 ul
Sterilized distilled water (Akuabides),  15 ul
10 uM forward primer,    5 ul
DNA template, colony from agar plate 0 ul
Total volume,      50 ul
4.Reaction conditions for PCR were as follow:
95 °C, 2 minutes
95 °C, 30 seconds
53 °C, 30 seconds
72 °C, 2 minutes
72 °C, 7 minutes
Total cycle, 35 cycles
