Biobrick
Composite
BBa_K1508003 (IIA(Glc) + double terminator)
This biobrick contains gene coding for  IIA(Glc) (BBa_K1508002), followed by double terminator (BBa_B0015). IIA(Glc) is glucose-specific phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate : glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS). This circuit inserted to the upstream part of plasmid Bba_J04450. We hypothesized that by over-expressing the enzyme, more glucose can be uptook compared to normal condition.
Coding
BBa_K1508002 (IIA(Glc) - E.coli glucose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA)
Phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a major carbohydrate active -transport system, which is executed by a cascade of protein rally. For glucose uptake, IIA(Glc) is the only enzyme specific to glucose transport. We measure the concentration of glucose in the medium using catabolite repression mechanism toward lacI promoter activity upstream of a reporter gene, mRFP. We expect by over-expressing IIA(Glc) in E. coli, we will obtain different range of glucose standard curve in our measurement system.
BBa_K1508000 (IIA(Glc) - Glucose-specific phosphotransferase enzyme IIA component from E. coli)
IIA(Glc) - previously known as IIA(Glc) - is glucose-specific phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS). Therefore, we hypothesized that by over-expressing the enzyme, more glucose can be uptook compared to normal condition.
