On August 26, 2014 Sumbawagen team had the opportunity to introduce the ECONEY project in @america Hotel Ritz Carlton, Jakarta supported of US government in Indonesia.
Taking this opportunity, we introduce iGEM and our ECONEY project. In this presentation, Sumbawagen team presents the reason why our team made a device to measure the level of glucose in honey. The representative of US embassy, officials of the State, Rector of Sumbawa University of Technology, and the Dean of our Faculty were present to witness the presentation. In this project presentation, we wear Sumbawa traditional clothes as a special attraction to the audience. After the presentation was completed, our team shares Sumbawa traditional food to the audience which was made from Sumbawa honey to introduce the local wisdom of Sumbawa and as a present of our gratitude to the audience.
