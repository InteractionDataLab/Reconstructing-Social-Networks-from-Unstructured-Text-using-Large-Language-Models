Notebook – Results – 5. Confirmation of protein expression by SDS-PAGE
The figure here showed data of SDSPAGE. ACFL is sample from E. coli BL21(DE3) supposed to express mRFP and full length Adenylate cyclase. 2AGL is sample from E. coli BL21(DE3) supposed to express mRFP and IIA(Glc). While CTRL is sample from E. coli BL21(DE3) supposed to express mRFP.
Protein band corresponding to mRFP was clearly shown in either total proteins or soluble proteins which mean that mRFP was expressed as soluble protein. Meanwhile protein band corresponding to Adenylate cyclase could not be observed. Protein band corresponding to IIA(Glc) seemed to present.
However, after DNA sequencing result, it was confirmed that neither ACFL nor 2AGL coding genes were not able to be constructed. Thus all E. coli samples here were the same, namely only expressing mRFP – harbouring BBa_J04450.
