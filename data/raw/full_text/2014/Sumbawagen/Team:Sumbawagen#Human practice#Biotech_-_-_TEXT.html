Biotech Camp
Biotech camp is one of our efforts to introduce synthetic biology to the society, especially for high school students. Our team wants to introduce biotechnology which is a new field of knowledge in our region by giving the basic knowledge about biotechnology and what is synthetic biology to the future generation, especially the high school students.
We tried to increase the understanding of the students about synthetic biology by simulates simple experiments such as how to do fermentation and how to extract DNA using simple material like fruits.
To atract them to know more about synthetic biology, we present something fun in this event by playing a game about synthetic biology. The students look very enthusiast in this event, many students asked lots of questions. This event was a fun way for the students to learn more about synthetic biology.
At the end of the event, Sumbawagen team and high school students join in the photo session.
