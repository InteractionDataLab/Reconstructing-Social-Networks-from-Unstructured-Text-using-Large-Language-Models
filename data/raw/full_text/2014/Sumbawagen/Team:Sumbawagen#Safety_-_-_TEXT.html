Safety
We aim to create an engineered E. coli which capable to measure the concentration of glucose in honey by calibrating the color of E. coli medium using android-based mobile phone. In our project we create a novel circuit without producing any biosynthesis product. So, there’s no risk in commerce or industry. In this safety page, we divided our safety procedure into 3 general title, which are:
1. Safety Rules in Laboratory
2. Safety Project
3. Safety Form
1.Safety Rules in Laboratory
The basic rules in our laboratory are:
a. Everyone has been trained before participate the laboratory experiment. The training covered several topics, such as basic information of IGEM and synthetic biology, technique of DNA isolation and handling, cutting and joining of DNA, plasmid transformation, handling the synthetic biology waste and basic rules of laboratory safety.
b. Everyone who works in the laboratory should follow the basic standard of laboratory safety, such as wearing safety cloth (lab coat, rubber gloves, and surgery mask).
c. In order to minimize the contamination, we do the experiment in laminar air flow (clean bench), following the standard procedure.
d. Laboratory activities were done by the students under supervision of instructors.
2. Safety Project
We are working with 2 types of E. coli strain; they are E. coli BL21 (DE3) and E. coli DH5α. Both of strain are classified in biosafety level 1 and including to risk group number 1 (low risk).  It does not cause disease in healthy of adult humans and also does not have any additional safety precautions. We handle the organism safely by keep it into the safe place in our laboratory. We work in the lab where not all people have access to enter the lab.
Our project resulted biological waste. In order to dispose the biological wastes (for example used pipette tip), according the standard of laboratory safety, we collect them together in a certain box with label and decontaminated the autoclave before disposal or destroyed; the liquid waste such as cell culture and agar plate treated by decontamination with autoclave according to the laboratory standard operational procedures and dispose the material to the sanitary sewer system.
We use lab coat, rubber gloves and surgery mask in order to minimize contamination of the experiment whether in the laboratory or workshop for the society.
