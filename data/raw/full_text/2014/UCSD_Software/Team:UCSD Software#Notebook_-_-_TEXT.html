Week (4) of July 14
2014 07 14- Monday
Updates:
Breadth-First Search and Topological Sort Algorithms are possible traversal algorithms that will be implemented in our design.
Tasks:
When visualizing your network don’t mind the details such as device composition, simply denote devices as a node along with transitions and intermediates. For transitions, just write it in conditional probability format. For example, A+B > D the transition will be written as D| A+B which reads as “ D given A+B.” Eventually we will be substituting our transitions with a mathematical functional representing a logic gate.

KP
CyNetShare now runs on our (mine, for now) server so we can make as many changes as we want to (to suit our network)!
We can now select nodes to display images just like we could in Cytoscape.js (more about this at meeting).
This will allow us to click on devices to view them in greater detail. Next week I might try to display images in the table instead, so that if you select multiple nodes you can see multiple images. I’ll also try running the CyNetShare graph on JSON files provided by Fernando to see if the format is correct.
Today’s tasks include pushing web dev files to the master branch so that the home page of our website runs normally again (if you try to run it with the files currently in master branch, the CSS appears to be broken as we’re missing a few files). Basically cleaning up the web dev part of the master branch.

Joaquin
Created a database_to_pigeon.py that pulls information from the database that is used in pigeon commands
Talked with yesterday Tiffany about the database_to_pigeon.py
Worked with Tiffany to check her code and how it works with database_to_pigeon.py
Established with Valeriy, Gary and KP information necessary to produce the final CyNetShare visualization. Two files will be created nodes.txt and edges.txt nodes.txt will have the following information Node_ID, Name, Type where type is either intermediate, transition or operon. Type may not be used during the creation of the json but this information may be necessary for CyNetShare. Later the Type can be mapped to the Node_ID dictionary style edges.txt will have the following information Source_ID, Target_ID, Math (Probably just for visualization purposes in CyNetShare simply as a text to see a label). Math is only important for transitions nodes. Later the Math can be mapped to the Transition_Node_ID.
Skyped with Fred so he can help me out with the Miriam ID using the Bioservices Module as well as helping to create the nodes.txt and edges.txt for the website team.
Talked with Jenhan and through a mention transitions tables decided to include the in the database. This may cause some denormalization but it makes it possible to look up specific transitions. This includes a transitions_input table and a transitions_output table. The good thing about these tables is that they can be made from data we have already captured and provide a Transition ID for them. Transition_input Operon_ID TO_ID Intermediate_ID Transition_output Intermediate_ID TI_ID Operon_ID Made some test data for Valeriy using the test database
Gary

Script not complete because edges are inaccessible from database (I already message Joaquin). I can develop an ad hoc solution independent of the database however this would defeat the purpose of having a database

Cleaned up google drive
Joaquin
Fix operon ID’s in the database creator
Traverse subnetwork needs to be reconfigured to build network from input_transition_ids only.
Fix operon to output transition mapping.
Right now operons have multiple output transitions.
As part of the above bullet. Need to fix method to reflect the operon to single output transition mapping.  Fix is located inside of the method just uncomment the correct part. Delete the incorrect function.
def get_output_transition_node_from_it_id(cursor, input_transition_id):
Path list of list is still incomplete. Must work on it.
Positions are connected to the json creator
Need a x_factor and y_factor to scale the positions as necessary. Got a number!!!
x_factor = 1376
y_factor = 768
Keep pigeon work going.
Contact Lauren
dummy id’s are used based upon the number of edges
Gary
Rendered full network JSON from Joaquin’s code.
Needs further refinement on systematic attribution of ID’s.
Tweaking html and laying down function frameworks for search box.
Reorganized app html for easier styling and positioning.

Lauren
New names for pigeon files
Added colors to each species. No color repeats within single operon
Gary
Continued to work with Valeriy to improve the layout of the SBiDer app page.
Encountered major error when trying to debug and run GET requests.
For some reason, parts of the application written on Mac are not compatible with the Windows machines. Causes GET requests to fail.
Error also makes git pull’s between affected computers and files non-operational.
As of now, I’m working off dummy files made of the real data, meaning that the only difference is that they are not grabbed live from the database.
Completely redesigned WIP modeling and validation.
The code was not sufficiently modularized and separated into functions to provide the dynamicism needed to handle varying numbers of graphs and equations.
Current code is more modularized and partitioned.
