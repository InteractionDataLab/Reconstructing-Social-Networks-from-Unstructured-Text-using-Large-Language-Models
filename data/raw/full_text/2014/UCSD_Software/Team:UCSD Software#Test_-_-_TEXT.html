Jenhan Tao
Bioinformatics PhD, 2018
Bioengineering, UC Berkeley, 2012
LinkedIn
Jenhan is a PhD student in the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology program at UCSD. He's interested in utilizing computational technqiues to increase our capacity to understand complex biological problems such as cell signalling. This is Jenhan's second year working as an iGEM mentor. Previously Jenhan was involved in synthetic biology research as an iGEM team member at Boston University and as a research assistant at UC Berkeley, the BioFAB, and Boston University.
Justin Huang
Bioinformatics PhD, 2018
Biology,Mathematics University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, 2013
LinkedIn
Justin Huang is a second year Bioinformatics PhD student at UC San Diego. Originally hailing from the great state of North Carolina, Justin completed his undergraduate studies with a BS in Biology and a BA in Mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2013. Justin's research interests are in translational medicine, specifically in the role of translational medicine in cancer. Justin is also an avid sports fan, and an advocate for Asian American issues. You can follow him @huangger on Twitter.
Benjamin Kellman
Bioinformatics PhD, 2018
Biology, University of Rochester, 2012
LinkedIn
Benjamin Kellman is a PhD student at the University of California at San Diego studying Bioinformatics and Systems Biology. His work uses existing formalisms in mathematics and computer science to consolidate the spurious information of experimental biology to a more codified rule set; many such reductions have already been made. He hopes to apply fundamental biological axioms formalism to increase the power of my biological predictions.
Andreas Dräger
Bioinformatics PhD, 2018
Bioengineering, UC Berkeley, 2012
LinkedIn
Andreas Dräger is a Research Scholar at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), United States, Bioengineering Dept., in the laboratory of Prof. Dr. Bernhard Ø. Palsson. He was a Research assistant and PhD student at the Center for Bioinformatics (ZBIT), University of Tuebingen from 2006-2011 and a  Junior group leader at the Center for Bioinformatics (ZBIT), University of Tuebingen since 2011. Annually, the University of Tuebingen bestows the dissertation award on the most outstanding doctoral theses of each faculty. In 2011, the Math and Science faculty awarded Dr. Andreas Dräger for his PhD thesis.
