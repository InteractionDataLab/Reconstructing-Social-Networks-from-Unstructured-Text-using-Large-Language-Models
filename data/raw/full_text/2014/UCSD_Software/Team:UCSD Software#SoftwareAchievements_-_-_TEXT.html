iGEM Gold Medal requirements
We did some modeling of circuits predicted by our tool, validation of search results, and complexity analysis work of our project. You can find details under the Validation section and Modeling section of the Project page. Using our tool, we were able to predict several novel circuit topologies recently published by Piro et al
We re-used and improved an existing database, & developed on it ( Linh's paper ). We also made use of SBOL visual (decribed in further detail under the "Web Application" section of the Project page). Furthermore, we utilize and extend the web-application architecture used by the Owl Datasheet generator project from iGEM 2013
We created a Python API for interacting with our database. The API documentation is available on the Documentation page as well as on Github . This way, other developers can use to build on our project or use it in novel ways for their own projects.
As mentioned earlier, we made use of SBOLv standard.
iGEM Silver Medal requirements
We've demonstrated the relevance of our project to Synthetic Biology here .
We have a comprehensive and well-designed Tutorial for using our app.
We created a Python API for interacting with our database. The API documentation is available on the Documentation page as well as on Github . This way, other developers can use to build on our project or use it in novel ways for their own projects.
We used QUnit, a JavaScript unit testing framework, for some of our work during the summer. In addition, we utilized a number of realistic test cases (pulled from published literature to validate our tool during development. Look here
iGEM Bronze Medal requirements
Our team is all registered and ready to go! We're all immensely excited to represent UC San Diego at Boston.
We've created a project description for our application here .
Find us ready with a Poster to talk about SBiDer at the Regional Jamboree and World Championship Jamboree, 2014.
Our code is well-documented and available via The iGEM Software Registry on GitHub.
