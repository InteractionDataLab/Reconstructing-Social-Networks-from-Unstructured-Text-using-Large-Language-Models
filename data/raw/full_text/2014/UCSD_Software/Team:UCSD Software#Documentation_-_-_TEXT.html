Testing
SBiDer Function Testing
Database
The database wrapper functions were tested by verifying correct table creation and droppage. Individual SQL Python wrapper functions were tested for proper input, update, and removal of table entries. Functions were tested on the SBiDer database itself to ensure future functional usage of the SBiDer API.
Logic Parser
The SBiDer logic parser required testing under multiple logic situations. The input necessary for parsing logic is specific due to the ability to make complex search queries. AND logic testing was done by verifying proper breakdown of the logic. OR logic testing was done by verifying that multiple queries were generated with the total number of queries equal to the total number of OR statements plus one.
Traversal: Direct  and Indirect Algorithms
To ensure that the correct paths were generated a Python unit test was constructed to verify proper operon activation along a given path. We considered two options for our traversal: direct path and indirect path.
In the direct path the preceding operon produces the species necessary for the activation of the following operon. Iteration through a loop ensured that all paths discovered by the traversal algorithm were legitimate activatable paths. This was done by starting at the first operon of every path and checking whether the starting input species were enough to activate the first operon. That operon would then produce some species that would then have to activate the next operon. Assertions were made at this point to verify if the species taken as input for operon activation were those produced by the previous operon or initial input. If all operons were activated then that would mean that the path was a correct linear path.
As an example query Lara and araC are the starting input species and gfp is the final output species. The query has the following operon path: pLac_pBAD--->LuxR_luxI followed by pTet--->gfp. An assertion is done at operon pLac_pBAD--->LuxR_luxI to verify if Lara and arac activate it. The assertion is passed because pLac_pBAD--->LuxR_luxI is activated by Lara and arac and the operon produces the species AHL and luxR. One last assertion is done to verify if AHL and LuxR  activate pTet--->gfp. This assertion is passed and so operon pTet--->gfp produces gfp, the desired final species.
The approach to verify the indirect traversal option was more involved due to path convergence. A Python unittest was created using two sets: one containing all inputs necessary for every operon in the path (set I), and one containing all of the outputs for every operon in the path plus the starting inputs (set O).  If set I is a subset of set O, this verifies that the indirect operon path is constructed correctly and therefore activation will occur.
An example the same query will be reused here below. The indirect traversal has the following path:  pCONST--->araC, pBAD--->T7-C, pT7--->gfp. pCONST--->araC uses a constitutive promoter (no input) and produces araC. pBAD--->T7-C takes as input arac and Lara and produces T7-C. pT7--->gfp takes as input T7 and produces gfp. Set I in this case contains arac, lara and T7. Set O in this case contains arac, Lara, T7 and gfp. Set I is a subset of set O so all of the input species necessary to activate the operons in the path are activated and the path is a correct path.
Traversal: Accounting for Repressor Species
The current SBiDer development only takes queries for activation of genetic devices. As a result operons may not be activated due to repression events. To verify this event it was necessary to manually trace and validate paths that had species products with repression interactions with operons that could potentially repress our system.
Complexity Analysis of the Search Algorithm
The complexity analysis was performed on the search algorithm, which have two methods of search: linear successive activation search (LSAS) and nonlinear successive activation search (NLSAS). Our complexity analysis concluded the complexity of LSAS and NLSAS to be O(mV^2) and O(m^2*V^4). respectively. Detailed complexity analysis can be found in the documentation section.
JSON Generation
The SBiDer network shown at the beginning of the SBiDer application as well as the subnetwork that resulted from the traversal output required JSON files with complete information. This information was captured using functions for data extraction and processing which were individually tested by running inputs and reviewing printing the resulting output with great care. Once the information was gathered, it was inserted into the JSON file generator. The JSON string was then taken and validated using the Online JSON Viewer . The image produced by the JSON converter was then displayed on CyNetShare using Cytoscape JS. In addition, the table generated by the JSON converter was validated against the database itself to ensure that the network was correctly reproduced.
SBML Generation
The SBML document was taken and validated using the Online SBML Validator (http://sbml.org/Facilities/Validator/). We ensured that our SBML documents were accurate.
SBOL Validation
We confirmed that the images we generated supported the SBOL standard by comparing the corresponding text file for each image to with images from the SBOL website. We ensured that the correct images were produced for all of the image.
