Project Description
Content
Our project is to create a series of tools for inducing, measuring and counting intracellular calcium spikes in both bacteria and yeast. Calcium is known to be extremely important in its function as a signaling ion in eukaryotic organisms; thus, it is valuable to develop synthetic biology tools for studying calcium dynamics within cells. The tools we are creating with this project will enable future study of calcium in bacteria and yeast, as well as create a groundwork for future genetic circuits to be created to study calcium in these organisms, and, eventually, in multicellular organisms.
References
iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you though about your project and what works inspired you.
You can use these subtopics to further explain your project

Conclusions
It's important for teams to describe all the creativity that goes into an iGEM project, along with all the great ideas your team will come up with over the course of your work.
It's also important to clearly describe your achievements so that judges will know what you tried to do and where you succeeded. Please write your project page such that what you achieved is easy to distinguish from what you attempted.
