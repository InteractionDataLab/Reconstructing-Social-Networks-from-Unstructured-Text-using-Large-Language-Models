Open Day of BNU Lab
October 17th, 2014 was a special day for BNU team, because we finished most of the demanded work of iGEM 2014 and this is also our Open Day. Students from middle school, high school and other departments of BNU, and even some professors visited our lab. We displayed our poster and taught them do some basic experiments. Some stickers were also handed out to them, so they can stick their feelings on our black board. This is a good change to foster scientific awareness, especially in the area of synthetic biology.
Ma Di led the students from senior high to our lab and taught them basic skills such as aseptic technique, bacterial culture, plasmid transfer. The senior high students were very happy to see that interest things.
