Overview
Safety, including lab and environment safety, is always our top concern.
In lab, all members have received safety trainings before working on our project; experiment regulations are rigidly observed.
Regarding environment, we have evaluated the project feasibility and its relating security issues. We designed a kill switch to guarantee our “Prometheus” is under control while capturing Molybdenum and delivering it to roots of legumes..
The safety questions:
1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues?
We use Escherichia coli, strain DH5α and TOP10 in our work. These strains are commonly used and proved safe when handled properly. All living materials and their extract are sterilized before disposing. Students cannot access working zone without wearing lab coats, long trousers and closed shoes. For certain kinds of work, safety glasses and appropriate protection gloves are required. No other activities are allowed in the lab, and we ensure no experimental material could be taken out.
2.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) you made this year raise safety issues?
None of our biobricks expresses toxic products, and all are thus considered safe. We expect no safety problem with these genetic materials.
3. Any local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Professor Wang Yue, the famous health law expert in China from Peking University Health Science Center, is among our team advisors. We consulted him about the related issues to ensure all the experiments are legal and legitimate. Besides, the lab manager, who takes charge of lab safety in Beijing Normal University,offered us a lot of valuable advice regarding waste disposal and lab safety.
