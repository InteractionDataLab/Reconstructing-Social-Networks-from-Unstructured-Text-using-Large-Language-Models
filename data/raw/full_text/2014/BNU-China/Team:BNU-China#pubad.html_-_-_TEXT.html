Public Advertising Overview
Since 2011, iGEM has launched high school division. This is a good opportunity for high school students to experience the cutting-edge synthetic biology and it gives potential momentum to the development of biology.
More and more high schools have chosen to participate in iGEM during the past four years. The number of teams from Asia, especially from China is increasing slowly, but teams from Beijing remain unchanged. We think high school students are the best candidates to be the future iGEMers.
According to the official website of iGEM, 54 high school teams are participating 2014 jamboree, including 10 teams from China, two out of which are from Beijing. They are Haidian Foreign Language School and Beijing No.4 Middle School.
In order to encourage more students to participate iGEM, we visited The Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University and gave them a lecture about iGEM on October, 17th. We also paid attention to social justice. As we are students from Beijing Normal University, we focus on education justice. Hence, we also paid visit to a school in the rural area of Weifang. We also have a Open Day of our lab. The details are as follows.
