Furture iGEMers
To promote iGEM and attract more high school teams from Beijing, our team went to The Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University to give them a lecture about iGEM on October.17.2014. This high school is a key high school in Beijing, which has gained considerable fame in China and certain degree of influence abroad. With advanced teaching facilities and outstanding teachers, the garden-like school attaches great importance to teaching science and technology, so they are glad to learn more about iGEM.
During the classes, Di Ma gave a vivid speech on the general development of synthetic biology. Yuelong Hou gave an impression on what iGEM is, especially on high school team. He also shared the happiness and hardness of scientific research. Xuan Wang shared BNU’s Promethus Program. The students were amazed at the powerful E. Coli Prometheus.
After classes, they showed eagerness to participate in next year’s high school program and asked us to give more classes after the trip back from Boston. And visiting our lab motivated them to practice and learn more about synthetic biology. We also want to help them to build a senior high iGEM team in future. Their feedbacks from 27 students were as following.
Questions:
1. Do you know synthetic biology before? (您在我们的介绍之前知道合成生物学么？)
Yes-2 No-25
2. Do you know iGEM before? (您之前听说过iGEM么？)
Yes-0 No-27
3. Do you want to participate in High School iGEM after the lecture? (在我们的介绍过后，您希望参与iGEM活动么？)
Yes-21No-2 Not sure-4
4. Do you think that you have already gained some basic knowledge of biosafety? (通过我们的介绍，您已经了解了有关生物安全的知识么？)
Yes-16 No-3 Not sure-8
5. Do you think biology is more interesting after the lecture?（通过我们的介绍，您觉得生物学更加有趣了么？）
Yes-18 No-2 Not sure-7
We think that most of the students from Second High School Attached to Beijing Normal University know more about iGEM and are fond of it as well. This is an early step for the future iGEMers.
