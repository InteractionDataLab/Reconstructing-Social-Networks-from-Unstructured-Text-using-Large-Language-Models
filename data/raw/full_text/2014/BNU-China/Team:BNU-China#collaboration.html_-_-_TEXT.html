Collaboration
During this summer and late september, we provided assistance within our capacity to Peking, another iGEM team, iGEM14_Peking also help us.
We helped Peking iGEM team on the iGEM project including:
1.Modeling. We both focused on E.coil motility while solving our problems. Peking wanted to use a motility model in which E.coil will diffuse freely to the algae. To solve their problem,  we suggested that Fick’s lawof diffusion be a good choice. We designed is a dynamic modeling of E. Coli and peanut root system, which quantitatively describes the process of the engineered bacteria carrying Mo towards the root as a porter.
2.Standardizing. As we use pET-21A as a plasmid backbone to express our proteins, we helped Peking to standardizing BBa_K1378001
3.Judging the parts. INP was used as the scaffold of surface display system in two teams’ experiments. We compared displaying efficiency between INP and its variants including INPNC, INPN. We recommend to use INPN for it's benefits.
