The enzyme is composed of the heterotetrameric MoFe protein that is transiently associated with the homodimeric Fe protein. Therefore, Molybdenum is an indispensable chemical element to nitrogen fixation and agriculture.</P><P>According to the Liebig's law of the minimum, which states that growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available, but by the scarcest resource, molybdenum as a trace mineral, is identified as limiting the growth of peanuts in large field of China. So molybdenum powder is commonly used as a fertilizer in agriculture. And our project aims to establish an <I>E.coli</I> strain that is able to capture Mo in the medium, directional deliver itself to root system and kill itself eventually.</P><H2>ModA</H2><P>The genes encoding a molybdate transport system (mod) have been isolated and sequenced from <I>Escherichia coli</I>[2–5] Four genes modABCD, organized in an operon, share strong structural similarity and sequence homology with genes encoding binding -protein dependent solute(or ABC-type) transport systems [2–5]. The first gene, modA, encodes a periplasmic binding protein. ModB and ModC have sequence homology with integral membrane and cytoplasmic ATP hydrolysis components of ABC transport systems, respectively. ModD does not show sequence similarity to any gene product in current databases and its role in transport is unclear. Two more genes, modEF, are also involved in molybdate transport. The modE gene encodes a regulatory protein that effects molybdenum-dependent repression at the modA promoter [6–8]. The exact role of modF is not yet clear [6].</P><P>The mod operon encodes a very high affinity(Km=15 nM) molybdate transport system. The low K values agree well with previous results obtained with the enteric diazotroph K. pneumoniae ([1]; Km=20 nM, J. Imperial, unpublished results). and adequately explain the high molybdenum scavenging capacity observed with most bacteria[11].</P><P>ModA, the periplasmic binding component of the mod system. had a K for molybdate of 3–5 mM. This is one of the highest substrate Kd values reported for any periplasmic binding protein [9,10] and contrasts with the low Kd values for molybdate uptake

Ice-nucleation protein (INP), an outer membrane protein from Pseudomonas syringae, is responsible for promoting nucleation of ice at relatively high temperatures (above -50C). The proteins are localised at the outer membrane surface and can cause frost damage to many plants. It is composed of three domains structurally distinguished as the N-terminal domain (191 amino acids, 15% of the protein), which is the portion most responsible for targeting to the cell surface, the C-terminal domain (49 amino acids, 4% of the protein), and the central domain, composed of repeats comprising an 8-, 16-, and 48-residue periodicity that acts as a template for ice crystal formation.</P><H2>WHY INPNC</H2><P>INP has been successfully used to display several proteins, such as levansucrase, carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase), Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 and so on[1]. This was achieved using either full-length sequences ortruncated portions containing only N- and C-domains (INP- NC) or INP-NC with five additional internal repeating units to display foreign protein on the surface of cell. containing only N- and C-domains means no repeat sequent, producing no ice-nucleation activity. This indicates that the central repeating domains are not required for export to the cell surface, and are therefore, ideal spacer units to control the distance between the passenger protein and the cell surface. Importantly, INP can be expressed at the cell surface of <I>E. coli</I> at a very high level, without affecting cell viability: comparable to the endogenous expression of the OmpA porin[2].</P><P>Before us, there was some teams that used INPNC as display system successfully, which is encoded by inaZ. INPNC is used to display passenger protein, such as EYFP, silica binding protein and so on. After researching NCBI, we found that there are several types of nucleotides encoding INP, including inaZ, inaQ, inaK, inaV, inaX. Because inaZ, inaV ,inaX have less support by the published literature comparing to inaQ and inaK, we hope that we can use inaQ or inaK as target gene of recombinant plasmid to alleviate burden of <I>E.coli</I>.</P><H2>WHY INPN</H2><P>Then we found that using INP derivatives containing only N-domain (INPN) as display system successfully is possible. The passenger proteins are also various, such as Japanese Encephalitis Virus Pathogenicity, phosphate-binding protein and so on. There is also literature which alleges that since full-length INP is quite large (1,200–1,500 amino acid residues), functional truncated INP molecules may serve as better anchoring motifs to carry large heterologous proteins.</P><P>So we start thinking that we also could use INP derivatives containing only N-domain (INPN) as display system. As we say early, inaZ has less support. So, we use inaK and inaQ as ingredient. According to the results of literature survey, inaK-N has about 658bp and inaQ-N has about 525bp. We hoped truncated INP molecules serve as better anchoring motifs to carry heterologous proteins, our ModA.</P><H2>Reference</H2><P>[1] Mei Li Wu, Chun Yung Tsai&amp; Tsai Hsia Chen, 2005, Cell surface display of Chi92 on Escherichia coliusing ice nucleation protein for improved catalytic and antifungal activity</P><P>[2] Edwin van Bloois, Remko T.

Briefly, we want fusion protein that INPN is integration with ModA, as result. Everybody knows, two kinds of proteins are liked with each other may lead to change of high levels of protein structure. And other problems together make constructing fusing protein difficult.</P><P>We had two methods to fuse two protein:</P><P>1.	Fusing PCR</P><P>After we tried Gibson Assembly unsuccessfully, we started work on fusing PCR. To avoid change the senior structure of proteins, we decide add a linker between two protein, which is about 6bp. We designed our primer, did our experiments.But because of spending much time on Gibson Assembly, we did not have the certain results yet. And we still work on so far.</P><P>2.	Gibson Assembly</P><P>We did the Gibson Assembly first. Gibson Assembly is a high-efficiency DNA end-linking technique developed by Daniel Gibson at the JCVI in 2009. The technique was invented and perfected as part of the genome assembly efforts at JCVI. The method uses three enzymes to join two or more sequences of DNA when they have overlapping end sequences at their joining point (~40bp). These overlapping regions can be easily added to the ends of any length of DNA by using PCR with primers which have added adapter sequences. Thus PCR followed by Gibson Assembly allows you to join any two blunt ended pieces of DNA. And it can be used to fuse heterogeneous proteins. Yet we failed. </P><P>After we tried so many times, we found the results had very high false positive rate. When we looked for reasons why we can not make it , we found something in wiki of Team: Washington.   https://2011.igem.org/Team:Washington/Magnetosomes/GibsonVectors The pSB standard BioBrick vectors available in iGEM are not suit for efficient multiple-insert cloning beyond three fragments. The primary problem with a standard pSB is the self-ligation of the two NotI sequences located on both the BioBrick prefix and suffix. These cohesive ends prevent fragments from being incorporated efficiently and correctly.</P><A href="#top"><P class="fig" style="margin-left:790px">Back to Top</P></A><P>*You can download the protocol of this part here:<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/8/80/Protocol_modA.pdf" target="_blank">Protocol_ModA.pdf</A></P><A class="button blue" style="margin-left:20px; float: left;" href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:BNU-China/overview.html">Prev Page</A><A class="button green" style="margin-left:680px" href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:BNU-China/Chemotaxis.html">Next Page</A></DIV><DIV id="copyright" class="opacity"><P>The Story of <I>E.coli Prometheus</I></P><P style="font:smaller">BNU-China</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
