Lab work safety
We're payign attention to every detail in our experiment to guarantee the safety of ourselves and our teamates.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Laboratory Biosafety Manual, the rank of our lab is classified as BSL1 (bio-safety level1), the one with lowest risk. Under proper precautionary measures, researchers wouldn't be threat with any harms.
All team members are required to undergo professional biological lab training before experiments started. The training areas cover molecular biology, biochemistry, cytology, and plant physiology. Safety instructions set prior to the start are always followed strictly. We wear white coats, gloves and masks all the time in the lab as required. The UV light of laminar flow is kept open before and after experiment to kill bacteria.
We're very concerned with the safety of team members. The dry- and wet-work space are separated to prevent contamination from reagent. Additionally, lab is cleaned everyday and eating is not allowed in the lab.
