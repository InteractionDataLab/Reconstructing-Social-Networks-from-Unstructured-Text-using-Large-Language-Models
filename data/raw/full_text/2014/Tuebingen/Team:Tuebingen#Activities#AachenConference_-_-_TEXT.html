Aachen Meetup
Five team members of team Tuebingen joined the iGEM meetup in Aachen. The meetup was organized by Team Aachen and took place on two consecutive days, the 13th and 14th of September. A total of seven German teams were present; five of which presented their iGEM projects to the public audience on the first day. On the second day, two lectures were given about advances in the field of synthetic biology by external presenters. In addition, all teams presented their posters and gave presentations in front of fellow teams for feedback and constructive criticism. The meetup provided a chance for teams to socialize and discuss possible collaborations.
