Ni NTA Purification
Pellet
centrifugation of the bacterial culture for 10 min at 8000 rpm at 4 °C
discard the supernatant
 
Lysis
per 1g wet weight of the pellet add 4ml lysis buffer
fill up to 0.5 mg/ml with lysozyme
incubation on ice for 2 h
centrifuge for 30 min at 10000 g at 4 °C
 
Column
equilibrate the column with 0.5 ml Ni-NTA (0.25 ml bed volume)
add 0.5 ml lysis buffer and slightly centrifuge the buffer through the column, it has to stay wet (do twice)
pump the cell lysate (supernatant) for 1 h at ice through the column
 
Wash
twice with 1.25ml wash buffer
four times with 0.5 ml elution buffer
revover the supernatant
 
Load a sample of every step in a SDS gel .
All buffers come from the Qiagen "Ni-NTA Agarose Purification of 6xHis-tagged Proteins from E. coli under Native Conditions - Quick-Start"-protocol.
