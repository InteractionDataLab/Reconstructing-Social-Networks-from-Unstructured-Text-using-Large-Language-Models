Agarose gel electrophoresis
Reagents
1.0 g
Agarose
100 mL
1x TAE buffer
4 µL
Midori Green solution
x µL
6x Loading dye
5 µL
DNA-Ladder Mix
5-15 µL
DNA sample
 
Procedure
Add agarose to TAE buffer and heat in microwave until the agarose is completely dissolved. Cool  down the solution until it is about 40 °C and pour it in the gel electrophoresis apparatus. Add 4  μl Midori Green to the poured gel, mix the suspension and add the comb. Place the solid gel in  the gel electrophoresis apparatus (with the wells near the cathode) and fill with 1x TAE buffer. Fill the wells with desired amount of DNA mixed with the 6x loading dye (to end up with a 1x  loading dye).
Start the gel electrophoresis by applying 100-120 V and stop when marker reaches the bottom of  the gel.
