Three part assembly
Digestion
Reagents
500 ng
part plasmid DNA
0.5 µL
of each restriction enzyme
2.5 µL
10x NEB buffer 2
0.25 µL
100x BSA
to 25 µL
H20
Procedure
After mixing the reagents in a 1,5 ml Eppendorf-tube: Incubation at 37 °C overnight.
Heat inactivate the restriction enzymes at 80 °C for 20 min.
 
Ligation
Reagents
1 µL
10x ligation buffer
100-200 ng
upstream part plasmid
100-200 ng
downstream part plasmid
50 ng
destination part plasmid
1 µL
T4 ligase
1 µL
ATP
to 10 µL
H20
Procedure
Mix all reagents in a PCR-tube and if necessary add to 10 μl with H20.
Run cycler starting at 25 °C, reducing temperature hourly by 1 degree and remaining at 4 °C.
Heat inactivate the enzymes for 5 min at 70 °C.
Store at -20 °C.
