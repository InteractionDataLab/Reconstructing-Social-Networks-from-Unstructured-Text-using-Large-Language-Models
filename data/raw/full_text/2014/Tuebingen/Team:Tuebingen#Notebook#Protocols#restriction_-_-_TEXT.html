Protocols
Preparative restriction digests
Reagents
min. 2 µg
Plasmid DNA
2 µL
of each restriction enzyme
10 µL
10x NE buffer 2
1 µL
100x BSA
to 100 µL
H2O
 
Procedure
After mixing the reagents in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf-tube: Incubation at 37 °C overnight.
Heat inactivate the restriction enzymes at 80 °C for 20 min.
Treat the plasmid backbones with Antarctic Phosphatase (NEB-protocol).
