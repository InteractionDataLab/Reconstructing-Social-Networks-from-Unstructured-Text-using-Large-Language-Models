Although there are several scientific institutions located in Berlin which are conducting research in synthetic biology, there has never been an iGEM team from Berlin before. This is even more surprising as Berlin with its vibrant bio-arts and DIY-biology community seems to be the perfect location for successful iGEM projects. As an interconnected workforce, our team incorporates members from various scientific, cultural and creative backgrounds, which makes our team able to address complex issues from various perspectives. So far, iGEM Berlin consists of students from biotechnology, history, design, medicine, theoretical physics, informatics, and more. Our diverse team has been able to make valuable connections into the bio-arts scene of Berlin, working together with think tanks such as the Hybrid Plattform, as well as EU advisor Markus Schmidt and his Biofaction AG. Supported by the Hybrid Plattform, we organized a <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Berlin/Workshop" class="link">science and design workshop event on the 8/9.08.2014</A>. During this event we conducted a series of short presentations about synthetic biology, as well as about prototyping and speculative design. Participants from different backgrounds designed and constructed interactions, which deal with the idea of a biological modularity. The resulting interactions addressed currently much-debated issues about the future applications of synthetic biology. Surprisingly the participants focused on topics like performance enhancement, transhumanism, alternative materials and housing as well as standardization. By explaining the basic principles of synthetic biology and approaching synthetic biology with a limited complexity synthetic biological speculation became easily accessible and reached wide variety of people. In the beginning of September, we collaborated with the artists and scientists from the c-lab collective (UK) as well as the Artlaboratory - a berlin bio-arts space. In the <A href="http://artlaboratory-berlin.blogspot.de/2014/09/synthetic-biology-workshop-with-c-lab-5.html" class="link">Synthetic Biology Workshop</A> artists and other people were introduced to synthetic biology and performed their own cloning experiment. The whole event came to an end in Berlins first <A href="http://artlaboratory-berlin.blogspot.de/2014/09/synthetic-biology-workshop-with-c-lab-5.html" class="link">Science Café event</A> for synthetic biology organized and hosted by the iGEM Berlin Team. During this event, we had speakers from different backgrounds and we discussed chosen aspects of synthetic biology with participants openly over drinks and food. The artist Ping Lui from Cologne presented his speculative design of an oracle based on magnetotactic bacteria. Rüdiger Trojok, an infamous German biohacker presented his current project, Howard Boland shared his bioart projects and former iGEM involvement with us and Johann from our team gave a short presentation about iGEM and our project. These events were designed to have a high impact on the German understanding of synthetic biology and were a major success in Berlin. One of the current major issues in synthetic biology is the laws and regulations concerning patents. iGEM generally refuses patents and promotes the idea of open source biology. However, as the success and applicability of synthetic biology depend on industry investments, there has to be a compromise in policy regulations. To discuss this topic in detail we teamed up with patent lawyers from the Adares Patentanwältekanzlei as well as <A href="http://www.bio-commons.org/" class="link">Biocommons </A>(Creative Commons license model for Synbio) activist Rüdiger Trojok to discuss patenting and fundamental principles of intellectual property.
In summary, we used art events and practical workshops to confront the German public with issues of synthetic biology. Furthermore, our project of creating a remote control for E. coli bears various practical applications as well as expands the possibilities of future functional biological systems. <STRONG>Collaborators of iGEM Berlin 2014</STRONG><UL><LI>iGEM Virtus Parva Mexico
