Safety
Our country uses a four-part „Safety Level“ rating system for laboratories. Level 4 is used for the most dangerous organisms.
This is equivalent to the WHO system. The Safety Level of our lab is Level 1 (low risk).
About our lab
Material used:
We use open benches and Laminar flow hood / biosafety cabinet with open front to handle biological materials.
We handle cancerogenous materials such as ethidium bromide or polyacrylamide under separate closable hoods. Also acidic and basic solutions are handeled behind closable hoods. All radioactive materials or methods are located in a separate laboratory in the basement.
We also have a separate room for RNA work.
Protection:
For protecting ourselves while doing lab chores, we use full face shields during cutting out gels or any work that involves longer exposure to UV radiation. We certainly use nitril gloves for handling any ethidium bromide and polyacrylamide contaminated materials. Safety glasses are frequently worn, especially if dangerous materials like acids, bases and liquid nitrogene are used or if there is anything that can splash like at the AKTA. Fur using -80°C freezers we use isolated gloves.
The laboratory safety training requirements of the Technical University Berlin can be found here or here (BG RCI) .
All Team members received a  safety training.
Disposal:
We collect biological waste in big containers within the lab and autoclave it later. The autoclaved waste is then taken care of by the institute. Contaminated and non-contaminated broken glas are collected separately. There is also a separate waste for cancerogenous and environmental hazardous waste like ethidium bromide gels etc.
Biosafety guidelines of the Technical University Berlin:
The Institutional Biosafety Officer (BSO) is responsible for ensuring that laboratories are working safetly with biohazardous materials. This includes the periodic inspection of laboratories, developing emergency plans for handling spills and accidents and investigating laboratory accidents involving biohazardous materials. The BSO also provides technical consultation for researchers on conducting risk assessments, safety practices, and security. Environmental Health and Safety provides services necessary for biological research. These services include biomedical waste disposal, autoclave quality assurance, biosafety cabinet certification, biosafety inspections, training and emergency response. Know the hazards associated with the biological materials and procedures used  in the laboratory. Follow approved lab procedures and safety guidelines. Know the emergency procedures. Complete all required training before conducting any lab activity. Utilize all required Personal Protective Equipment. Do not work alone in the laboratory.

Identified possible risks
of our project
At this point we want to show that we have dealt with the possible risks of our project.
Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
We are working with E.coli, the strains we are using are characterized as non-pathogenic, BSL 1. However, we try to modify E.coli by knocking out genes - therefore, every person who is working in the lab has to take care of the possible risks. Consequently, it is mandatory to wear labcoats and gloves to minimize any risk of contamination. Also for other labwork e.g. dealing with chemicals such as Ethidium bromide, team members have to use the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and have to be personally instructed.
Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from our lab):
We are using non-pathogenic E. coli strains and even our genetically modified E.coli strains are not changing the risk of pathogenic influences on human beings. Nevertheless, we are taking care to avoid any possibility of contaminating the environment with our E.coli strain or any kind of non-natural agents.
Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from our lab):
Material which was in contact with any organisms is autoclaved by normal BSL-1 procedures. Organic solvents, solutions as well as agarose gels and gloves containing Ethidium bromide are separately disposed according to the guidelines of our institution. We are strictly trying to reduce the amount of contaminated material and also the amount of consumables which are made of plastic.
Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
None. The entry of the BSL-1 are of our building is restricted and continuously controlled by security personnel. As our project does not create any E. coli strains or BioBricks with harmful or toxic properties, malicious mis-use by other individuals is ruled out.
What new risks might arise from our project's growth?
If all of our dreams became true, one possible application of our project would be gut cancer treatment. The strains we are using are E.coli. This microorganism is ubiquitous in the human gut-system. Nobody is capable to say what would happen when our modified strains are in fact applied to a human being. It could for instance occur that the applied strain is interacting with the natural bacterial strains in the gut-system - this might provoke irritations and lead to stomach/intestinal problems. However, every developed system will change through evolution - so, nobody is capable to say what exactly will happen by application of the genetically modified E.coli. Any application should be under strict supervision and only be done by professional medical personnel.
For our possible application one could use inducible promoters. When you apply the modified E.coli strain the desired effects from BioBrick gene expression are then only induced in presence of a special non-harming chemical substance (e.g. IPTG).
