iGEM BERLIN
Remote-controlled E. coli bacteria?       That’s the aim of the interdisciplinary iGEM Team Berlin!
Magnetic E. coli?
The bacteria shall be optimized for the absorption and synthesis of iron in order to            remote-control them magnetically. Small and efficient E. coli units with various areas            of use shall be the result.
These cells are attractive as they offer new solutions in bio therapeutics, bio materials and bio process engineering. Furthermore, we want to use these cells as remote controlled bacteria that can be controlled by a real time computer interface.

Project
In October 2014, a team of Berlin students from a variety of backgrounds are participating            for the first time in the international genetically engineered machines competition.            For our project, the iGEM Berlin team has decided to make E. coli bacteria susceptible to            magnetic fields. By knocking out the iron efflux transporter (FieF) and iron uptake            suppressor (FUR), we want to increase the total iron level of the cytosol. By sequestering            iron in a ferritin protein, iron crystals are formed and the cell is detoxified. In order            to create ferromagnetic of super paramagnetic crystals, we will then use an intensive high            through put media optimization to discover the best conditions for the formation of magnetic            nanoparticles in E. coli. Furthermore, we will work with other metal binding proteins like            metallothioneins and phytochelatin synthases in order to achieve nanoparticle synthesis in            E. coli. Once we have discovered the best way to magnetize E. coli bacteria we will build            and characterize a suitable BioBrick that can be used by any research lab or iGEM team in            the world in order to remote control the movement of E. coli cells.

Team
The iGEM Team Berlin consists of 17 students from various universities in Berlin.            Represented are the Technische Universität Berlin, University of Applied Sciences Berlin,            Freie Universität as well as the Humboldt University. The team members come from diverse            disciplines. From biology, biotechnology, biochemistry, computer science, mathematics, mechanical            engineering to the history of science and technology, everything is represented. Just the            interdisciplinary nature of the team allows us to jointly develop solution strategies from            different perspectives. Hosted by Prof. Dr. Nediljko Budisa from the TU Berlin, our lab is            located at the Müller-Breslau-Straße 10, 10623 Berlin. Come by for a visit (Monday 5 pm).

Safety
Our country uses a four-part „Safety Level“ rating system for laboratories. Level 4 is used for the most dangerous organisms.             This is equivalent to the WHO system. The Safety Level of our lab is Level 1 (low risk).
