Meet the Team
Our team is made up of 17 undergraduates and postgraduates from a wide range of disciplines as well as our supervisors. The first iGEM Team Berlin 2014 is an assembly of highly motivated students from different universities.  Due to the multidisciplinarity our team is able to find different strategies to solve complex problems in synthetic biology.
Under the direction of Prof. Dr. Nediljko Budisa group leader of the Biocatalysis Group at the TU-Berlin.
Our lab is located at the Müller-Breslau-Straße 10, 10623 Berlin (Germany).
Come by for a visit (Monday 5 pm).
