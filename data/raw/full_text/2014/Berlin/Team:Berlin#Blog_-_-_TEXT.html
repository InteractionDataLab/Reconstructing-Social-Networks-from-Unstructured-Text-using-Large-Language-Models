News from the Lab I
Currently we are working in the lab with several plasmid DNA constructs which we have created according to a paper published from a korean group to magnetize E.coli.  Therefore certain steps are required, first we had to transform the plasmids into E.coli (Nissle 1917) after growing overnight (ON) at 37°C we did a preculture (LB and appropriate antibiotics) also at 37°C, ON. For fresh and competent cells the next day we to do a new approach, we inoculated LB + Antibiotic with the preculture from yesterday. After growth until OD600 0.6 we induced with Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG) and added the substance what was crucial for the magnetization of E.coli. After 12 up to 16 hours of incubation E.coli is tested by microscopy. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg__wTcO2KE

Awesome Graffiti
Our iGEM Team is in contact with several artists from Berlin. In order to bring synthetic biology to the street and therefore to the public mind… Leo made a graffiti iGEM-Logo for us. So now we are also known in the street art community!
