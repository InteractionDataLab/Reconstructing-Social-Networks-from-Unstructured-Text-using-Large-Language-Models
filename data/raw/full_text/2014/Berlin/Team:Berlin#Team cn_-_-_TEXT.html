Meet the Team
The iGEM Team Berlin consists of 17 students from various universities in Berlin. Represented are the Technische Universität Berlin, University of Applied Sciences Berlin, Freie Universität, University of the Arts as well as the Humboldt University. The team members come from diverse disciplines. From biotechnology, biochemistry, computer science, mathematics, mechanical engineering to the history of science and technology, everything is represented. Just the interdisciplinary nature of the team allows us to jointly develop solution strategies from different perspectives.
Hosted by Prof. Dr. Nediljko Budisa from the TU Berlin, our lab is located at the Müller-Breslau-Straße 10, 10623 Berlin.
Come by for a visit (Monday 5 pm).
