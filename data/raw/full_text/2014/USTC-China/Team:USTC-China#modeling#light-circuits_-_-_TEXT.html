We used Hill function and mass function to formulize the circuits into ordinary differential equation forms.

But collecting the steady states under different initial input light condition in the kinetic modeling, we can get the relation between the intensity of the input light and the amount of fluorescence.
The result agrees with the result in Tao's work .
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today
