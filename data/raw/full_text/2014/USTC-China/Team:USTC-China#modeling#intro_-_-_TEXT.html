Introduction
In our modeling efforts, we basically focused on three thing:
Gene Network
C.Crescentus's Characteristics
Physical Performance of Color Mangling
All we are trying is to give a insight into the system we are studying, to solve problems like:
How will different colors effect with each other?
Is our gene circuit design plausible?
Can we successfully integrate the E.coli and C.Crescentus?
So, we mainly model on four levels:
1. Colony level
2. Cellular level
3. Gene level
4. Physical level
