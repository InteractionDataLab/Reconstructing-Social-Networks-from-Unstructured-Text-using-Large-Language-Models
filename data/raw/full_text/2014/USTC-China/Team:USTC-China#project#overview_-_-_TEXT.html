Overview
Modern "lithography" has made images vividly printed on pages and animations vigorously projected on screens.
From that point, we move a step forward. Our project aims at conceiving and constructing a colorful bio-imaging system, on which once you project an image, ideally, the bio-system would exactly print it out on the substrate.
To accomplish this, novel bio-bricks(light sensors & color printers), Caulobacter crescentus(a sticky bacteria)and riboswitches were utilized to conceptually render it colorful,clear and compact. The results did prove this idea sound in principle, although further evaluation is required.
We have managed to build light sensing circuits of three color and a motion control device in C.crescentus. furthermore, RNA logical gates were built in vivo as substitutes for certain parts with hopefully unprecedented effectiveness.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today
