Communication
Being Online
Communication is really important to exchange our ideas while doing our project, thus we attached much attention to talking with many teams in China.
With Nanjing-China
The communication with Nanjing-China was held on April 3th to 5th during the Tomb-sweeping-day vacation in China. The contents contained both projects and some experience about experiments and modeling. And we sincerely appreciated Nanjing-China for their assistance of providing of some key parts for our project. Hope we can develop synthetic biology together with our true friendship.
With XMU
We participated the publication of newsletter firstly held by XMU. The newsletter, published every week as planned, will involve many teams from all over the world to introduce the project of their own and provide some key information and complicated problems of doing experiments. The first newsletter of our team was mainly about the brief introduction of our project and the history of our team. The second one contains the latest breakthrough of our work and puzzles required to be solved. The third letter talked about the organization of our team and the development of our team.
The 2nd International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference in Taiwan
The 2nd International genetically engineering machine conference was held in Hsinchu, Taiwan by National Chiao Tong University (NCTU) and NCTU_Formosa in August 3 to 8.More than 20 teams from Taiwan and Mainland joined the conference for understanding each other and meeting many friends. The conference included official presentations along with Q&A and a poster session.During the meeting, we introduced our project to all, received much valuable advice and gave much advice about other teams' work, especially the new team NEAU_China.

We sincerely acknowledge NCTU for their warm serve and we gained a lot through the conference.
