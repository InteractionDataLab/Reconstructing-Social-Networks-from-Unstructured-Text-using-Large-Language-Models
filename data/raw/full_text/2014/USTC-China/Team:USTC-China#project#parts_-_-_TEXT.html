Parts that We Design
This year we submit 20 designed parts. Eighteen of them were provided to the Parts Registry. These parts can be divided into the following kinds:
1.Blue and red  light sensing-imaging system
BBa_K1363400 : combination of R0010-K592016-B0015-K502020
BBa_K1363401 : the downstream pathway of the red color system
2.Motion control of Caulobacter crescentus
BBa_K1363000 : DgrA, the receptor of c-di-GMP
BBa_K1363001 : DgrB, the receptor of c-di-GMP
3.Biosynthesis of  holdfast of Caulobacter crescentus
BBa_K1363002 : HfiA the Inhibitor of synthesis of polysaccharose
BBa_K1363005 : R0082-HfiA the HfiA protein express pathway which can be regulated by ligh
4.RNA logicgates
BBa_K1363610 : key-1-of-or of RNA logic gates
BBa_K1363611 : key-1 of gate-of-or of RNA logic gates
BBa_K1363606 : And Key 1
BBa_K1363607 : And Key 2
BBa_K1363609 : Or Key 1
BBa_K1363610 : Or Key 2
BBa_K1363602 : key of yes of RNA logic gates
BBa_K1363603 : gate of no of RNA logic gates
BBa_K1363604 : key of no of RNA logic gates
BBa_K1363605 : gate of and of RNA logic gates
BBa_K1363601 : the gate of yes of RNA logic gates
BBa_K1363600 : a aptamyze regulator sensetive to Theophylline
BBa_K1363500 : a aptamyze regulator sensetive to Theophylline
5.Kill switch based on LALF regulation (Didn't submit)
BBa_K1363200 : Anti-LPS factor(LALF) regulated by lacI
BBa_K1363201 : Anti-LPS factor(LALF) regulated by IPTG
6.Conjugation parts from E.coli S17-1 to other bacteria.
BBa_K1363003 : OriT-K592016 the blue sensor which can be transfered into other bacterias by S17-1
BBa_K1363004 : the downstream pathway of the blue light system which can be transfered into Caulobacter crescentus
BBa_K1363006 : an experimental part used to test the conjugation
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today
