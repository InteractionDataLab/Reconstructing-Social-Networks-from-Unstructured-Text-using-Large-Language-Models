OUR PROJECT
Abstract
Modern "lithography" has made images vividly printed on pages and animations vigorously projected on screens. From that point, we move a step forward. Our project aims to conceive and construct a colorful bio-imaging system, on which once you project an image, ideally, the bio-system would exactly print it out on the substrate. To accomplish this, novel bio-bricks (light sensors & color printers), Caulobacter crescentus (a type of sticky bacterium) and riboswitches were utilized to conceptually make the system colorful, clear and compact. The results did prove this idea sound in principle, although further evaluation is required. We have managed to build light sensing circuits of three colors and a motion control device in C.crescentus. Furthermore, RNA logical gates were built in vivo as potential substitutes for certain parts of the system with hopefully unprecedented effectiveness.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today
