Background
To ensure that our bacterial won’t do harm to both people and our environment, we need to put a set of kill switch system into the bacteria, so that we can control the growth of it by changing the content of culture medium.
In our project, we trigger the kill switch of E.coil. by adding IPTG into the culture. IPTG can induce the expression of gene coding Limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) downstream the lactose operator, so that the growth of E.coil. will be inhibited.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today
