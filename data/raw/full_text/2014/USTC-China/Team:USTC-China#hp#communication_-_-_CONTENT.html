The contents contained both projects and some experience about experiments and modeling. And we sincerely appreciated Nanjing-China for their assistance of providing of some key parts for our project. Hope we can develop synthetic biology together with our true friendship.  </P><H3 id="withxmu">With XMU</H3><P>We participated the publication of newsletter firstly held by XMU. The newsletter, published every week as planned, will involve many teams from all over the world to introduce the project of their own and provide some key information and complicated problems of doing experiments. The first newsletter of our team was mainly about the brief introduction of our project and the history of our team. The second one contains the latest breakthrough of our work and puzzles required to be solved. The third letter talked about the organization of our team and the development of our team.  </P><H3 id="the2ndinternationalgneticallyengineringmachineconferenceintaiwan">The 2nd International Genetically Engineered Machine Conference in Taiwan</H3><P>The 2nd International genetically engineering machine conference was held in Hsinchu, Taiwan by National Chiao Tong University (NCTU) and NCTU_Formosa in August 3 to 8.More than 20 teams from Taiwan and Mainland joined the conference for understanding each other and meeting many friends. The conference included official presentations along with Q&amp;A and a poster session.During the meeting, we introduced our project to all, received much valuable advice and gave much advice about other teams' work, especially the new team NEAU_China. And the host guided us to visit Chi Hu in which Chiang Kai-Shek, the president of ROC, were buried and the National Palace Museum where many treasures and collections sit. We sincerely acknowledge NCTU for their warm serve and we gained a lot through the conference.  </P><H3 id="meetupinourschool">Meetup in our school</H3><P>The meet-up in our school is held up by USTC_Software in August 15-17. 6 teams in China joined the meet-up.
