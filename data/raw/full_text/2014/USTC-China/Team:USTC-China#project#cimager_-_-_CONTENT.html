According to the research, when a holdfast clings to a surface, the force on it reaches 68 N/mm2 high, which is regarded as the strongest biological glue known to exist in nature and is three times stronger as commercial 'super glue'. With the knowledge we have already known, if we are able to regulate the biosynthesis of flagellum and holdfast simultaneously with flourescent proteins controlled by light input, <I>C.crescentus</I> will stop swimming, develop holdfast to stay firmly and evenly on the plate while expressing flourescent proteins corresponding to light color simulation.</P><P><FIGURE style="text-align:center"><FIGCAPTION>

The stalked cell firstly turns into S phase when it is time for DNA replication. At that time, the bacteria grow up into pre-divisional cells. Later the cell enters the G2 phase when the cell becomes incompetent for DNA replication and it keep growing until finally compartmentalizing into two cells, either of who contains stalk and flagellum in one pole. For the swarmer cell which possesses flagellum, the rotation of flagellum is activated and two pili are generated as well. The swarmer one enters <I>G1</I> phase when its chromosome is different from the stalked one and it cannot reproduce itself. However, in <I>G1</I> phase, the holdfast is formed predominantly in the swarmer cell stage and these swarmer cells reenter S phase like a cell differentiation process exactly simultaneously when rotating flagellum disappears and holdfast is synthesized. As the research says, the development of stalk and holdfast help <EM>C.crescentus</EM> to live in some tough surroundings and enhance its ability to absorb phosphate passively when nutrition provide is limited and swimming using flagellum waste the energy that is original manuscript for necessary metabolism. Scientists found that <I>Pst</I> family correlate the length of stalk. As the hypothesis contains, if it is correct, stalk elongation may function to elevate single cell away from surface thus bacteria receive much high-level nutrient flux and if <EM>C.crescentus</EM> colonize with other organisms, stalk ensures bacteria to have greater access to nutrients comparing to other nearby surface species to be superior in competition and survival. Consequently, C.crescentus is able to survive without flagellum and even much more stronger when containing holdfast.</P><P><FIGURE style="text-align:center"><FIGCAPTION>

</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P><P>In the whole life cycle of <EM>C.crescentus</EM>, we mostly focus on the process of degradation of flagellum and biosynthesis of holdfast. Thus, we will discuss the pathway of the two parts dividedly and design a reasonable circuit containing protein involved the pathway controlled by light signals. </P><H4 data-magellan-destination="dgradgrb">DgrA/DgrB</H4><P>The concentration of <I>c-di-GMP</I> is varying, and for our experiment we will promote its expression to inhibit rotation of flagella.

The first method that hits our mind is chemical conversion. But through the literature, the main ways to transfer plasmids into C.crescentus are conjugation, electrotransformation and transduction. We test the first two-methods and only conjugation works at last. Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material (plasmid) between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells. Conjugation, regarded as a key bridge bewteen <EM>E.coli</EM> and <EM>C. crescentus</EM>, will improve the stability and resolution of pictures. </P><P>Protocol of conjugation is the following:</P><OL><LI>Culture <I>C.crescentus</I> and <I>E. coli</I> S17-1 overnight with the liquid medium.When the OD of <EM>C. crescentus</EM> reaches 2 and S17-1âs reaches 0.5,we can stop cultivating.</LI><LI>Mix S17-1 and <EM>C. crescentus</EM>  in a volume ratio of 2:1.Centrifuge it with 4000r/min and suspend the thallus again with 200Î¼l LB liquid medium.</LI><LI>Spread out an 0.45Î¼m nitrocellulose filter on the LB solid medium without antibiotics.</LI><LI>Spread the mixed bacteria liquid in step 2 onto the filter and incubate it at 30â for 3-7h.</LI><LI>After incubation,elute the thallus from the filter with 200-1000Î¼l LB liquid medium.</LI><LI>Spread it on the PYE solid medium with antibiotics and incubate it at 30â.Then we can get the <EM>C. crescentus</EM> with the target vector.</LI></OL></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="footer-ustc"><DIV class="row"><P>Lots of thanks to <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:USTC-China/acknowledgement">our sponsors</A>, who help us to achieve what we have today</P><P>Â© 2014 USTC-iGEM Design.
