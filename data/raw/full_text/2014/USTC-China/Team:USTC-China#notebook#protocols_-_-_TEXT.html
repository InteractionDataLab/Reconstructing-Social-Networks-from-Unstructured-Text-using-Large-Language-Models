Conjugation protocol
Steps
Culture C.crescentus and Ecoli.S17-1 overnight with the liquid medium.When the OD of C.crescentus reaches 2 and S17-1’s reaches 0.5,we can stop cultivating.
Mix S17-1 and C.crescentus  in a volume ratio of 2:1.Centrifuge it with 4000r/min and suspend the thallus again with 200μl LB liquid medium.
Spread out an 0.45μm nitrocellulose filter on the LB solid medium without antibiotics.
Spread the mixed bacteria liquid in step 2 onto the filter and incubate it at 30℃ for 3-7h.
After incubation,elute the thallus from the filter with 200-1000μl LB liquid medium.
Spread it on the PYE solid medium with antibiotics and incubate it at 30℃.Then we can get the C.crescentus with the target vector.
Conjugation of red light sensing-imaging system
We transfer the red and blue luminous plasmid following the conjugation protocol. [Pic][Pic]
Verification of C.crescentus
We use Gram Staining to verify the C.crescentus:
Prepare thin smear bacteria on a clean slide.
Cover the smear with few drops of crystal violet for 1-2min.
Wash excess strain with water.
Add few drops of iodine solution on the smear for 1-2min.
Rinse in water.
Wash with 95% ethanol for 20s.
Rinse in water.
Stain with 1% safranin for 2-3min.
Wash stain in excess water.
Look at it under a microscope.
Regular Protocols
Gel Electrophoresis
Standard 1% agarose gel
(Generally, 0.7%~2% agarose gel is  widely used in lab)
Measure out 1g agarose in scale, and then put the sample into conical flask.
Add 100mL 1XTAE into conical flask, shaking evenly.
(about 1xTAE: dilute the 50x TAE to 1x TAE: add 10mL 50x TAE and 490 mL double distilled water to form as a system for further use)
Plastic wrap can be used to pack the bottleneck.
Use microwave oven to heat the solution about 5mins until the agarose is all dissolved and the solution is boiling and clear. It would be better if we shake the flask again after heating 2 mins.(CAUTION: HOT! Please use wool gloves when picking and placing flask.)
Let the gel cool down about 2 mins.
Pour the gel into gel tray with the appropriate comb inserted in the side of tray and wait till the gel solified(It may costs about 10 mins). Then remove the comb
Put the gel into gel box with the 1XTAE just immerse the gel exactly. Please let passages stay towards the negative pole(Often black).
Carefully add samples with 6X loading buffer and marker into passages. Dosage is based  on the depth and width of passages.
Set electrophoresis conditions: 90V 600mA and 30mins and then turn on the power.
Disconnect the electrodes.
Utilize the devices that contains UV light to observe the gel and analyze the result.
Save the result in the computer for further use.
Gel Extraction
Preparation:
Check out whether ethyl alcohol is added into Wash Solution.
Check out whether Buffer B2 has sediment.
Adjust the thermostat water bath at 50 degree centigrade.
Procedure:
Cut up the effective bands under UV light and put the fragments into EP tubes with series numbers.
Measure out the weight of tubes of gel.
Add Buffer B2 3 to 6 times the volume of gel and then incubate the EP tubes in thermostat water bath about 50 degree centigrade about 10 mins.
Optional: If the length of the DNA strip is shorter than 500 bp, it would be better add isopropanol one third volume of Buffer B2.
After gel is all dissolved,  pour the solutions into absorption columns and centrifuge columns at 8000xg about 30s.
Add 500 ul wash solution in a centrifuge at 9000Xg about 30s and pour out the solution.
Do the step 5 again.
Centrifuge the empty columns at 9000xg about 1min.
Open the columns and air them about 10 mins.
Put the columns into clean 1.5 mL EP tubes and add 15-40uL Elution Buffer(2.5mM Tris-HCL,PH 8.5)(also can be substituted by TE or double distilled water). Stand about 1 min and then centrifuge at 9000xg about 1 min.
Keep the DNA solution and often measure the concentration of DNA and A260/A280 for further study.
The protocol is based on SanPerp Column Type DNA Gel Extraction Kit.
PCR System Preparation and Conditions Setting
PCR system(set 50ul system as an example):
The amount of substance of premier is written on the EP tubes. Calculating the volume of 1XTE required for 10uM primer solution is required before the system preparation.

Reaction conditions
Calculate the Tm Value. If the complementary strip is smaller than 20 bp, Tm=4X(A+T)+2X(C+G), and the annealing temperature is Tm-5 degree centigrade. If not, use software to figure out the exact Tm value.(Also Tm value exist in report)
PCR cycle:
1 cycle of 95 degree centigrade about 2 min for pre-degeneration;
30 to 35 cycles of 95 degree centigrade about 10 sec, Tm-5 degree centigrade about 20 sec and 72 degree centigrade 1kb per min;
1 cycle of 75 degree centigrade about 5 mins and stay the device in 4 degree centigrade.
The protocol is based on TransStart FastPfu Fly DNA Polymerase.
