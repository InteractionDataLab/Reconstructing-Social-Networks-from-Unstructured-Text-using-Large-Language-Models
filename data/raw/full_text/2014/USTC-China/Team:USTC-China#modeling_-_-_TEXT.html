Introduction
In our modeling efforts, we followed closely on our major 2 sub-projects,
Color Imaging and Motion Control
and their experimental connection.
Conjugation
Combing all the above, came the
C. imager Modeling.
The governing idea is that a model, intrinsically, should stare at the corresponding experiments, at the same time, go boldly beyond it. In this light, we built models not only deeply rooted in the experimental data, but also powerful of making audacious predictions.
In the Imaging part and the Motion Control part, we built models to simulate the behaviors of light-sensing, color-printing and motion-control genetic circuits, respectively.
On top of that, we attempted to build a procedure bridging the connection between a desired output image and the input image projected onto the bacteria. Also, in-depth modeling about motion control render us penetrating insights, clearly answering the question that how the sticky characteristic of C.C. could contribute to the clearance of output images.
Besides, as the experimental connection between the 2 sub-projects, process of conjugation is highly significant. Therefore, we elaborately established a model to analyze the concentration change of all types of bacterium involved in that process. Founded by concrete parameters extracting from experiments, it produced useful predictions to guide this experiment.
Despite the range, amount and power of our models, they also covered many mathematical & computational methods, ranging from ODE, phase-space analysis, agent-based model to Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, a variety types of figures and animations ensure the results vividly displayed.
Lots of thanks to our sponsors , who help us to achieve what we have today
