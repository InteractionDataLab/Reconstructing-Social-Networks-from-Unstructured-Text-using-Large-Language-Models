The regulations of GMOs in Africa are based on the consumer's perceptions, rather than on health and food safety. This is noteworthy because it could seem unethical that the health and security of people have a lower priority than the consumer's perceptions and it might indicate that populism and industrial interests have a large influence regarding political

One of the central questions which has led to public debate is whether scientists pretend to be God by constructing GMOs.
The agricultural industry has benefited from selective breeding throught centuries, and although this has led to discussions as well, it is a standard procedure which is well-known in the society.
Whether selective breeding to some extent is equal to the manipulation of living organisms is difficult to determine. One might claim that both methods entails modification of genetic material. However, there is no doubt that genetically engineering is a complex field, which includes careful considerations concerning safety and regulations among 
<SPAN class="sourceReference">others.</SPAN><SPAN class="tooltip"><SPAN class="tooltipHeader">Source:</SPAN>

Lack of scientific knowledge indicates a necessity of dissemination of research done by scientists. 
Especially research in genetically modified food is dependent on the applications in society. This is 
emphasized by the distinction between the uses of GMOs in agriculture compared to the production 
of pharmaceutical products, which has been described by C. Marris in her article about public views on 
<SPAN class="sourceReference">GMOs.</SPAN><SPAN class="tooltip"><SPAN class="tooltipHeader">Source:</SPAN>

This means that people are more likely to accept GMOs if they recognize an effect of a product, which is a well-known property of pharmaceutical products. It is therefore important to include the public in the laboratory work in hope of preventing a link between 
synthetic engineering and insecurity. Therefore, it is important that a scientist does not become ignorant to this reality but rather aims at converting science.

Although the developed part of the world has the resources to help populations suffering from undernourishment, malnutrition or both, it is worth acknowledging how the help appears to others.
In relation to the strict GMO regulations in Europe, one might reflect upon the justice of offering GMOs as 
food supplement to the developing countries. In addition to this, it is worth considering how the regulations of GMO in developed countries influence governments of developing 
<SPAN class="sourceReference">countries.</SPAN><SPAN class="tooltip"><SPAN class="tooltipHeader">Source:</SPAN>

GMOs in relation to agriculture in European countries. </P><H4>How will a controversial proposal be met by an established society?</H4><P><SPAN class="intro">Another consideration approaches </SPAN>the morals of offering GMOs to people who have limited access to food 
to begin with.<SPAN class="intro">First of all the</SPAN> finances relies on investments from nongovernmental organizations, benefactors or both.
The motive for this comes from the minimal output that is associated with relief aids, which is not beneficial 
from the perspectives of the industrial world. Secondly, there is a risk of violating the right of the individual to choose when the alternatives to GMOs are limited. The fact that the people in focus do not have alternatives to begin with could on the contrary support the application of GMOs.<SPAN class="intro">Unlike starving populations,</SPAN> the ethical concern of offering GMOs to malnourished societies is not whether it is unfair 
to offer this without alternative nutritional choices. In 
this context, it is decisive to aim at integrating the GMOs in the gastronomy that already exists, as the two 
nutrition experts also states in <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Tour51"> an expert opnion.</A> 
But, will the population of developing countries necessarily have a positive view on an initiative such as this
coming from the developed countries?</P><H4>Is it an ethical issue to eat genetically modified bacteria?</H4><P><SPAN class="intro">One question in our</SPAN> questionnaire was: <I>Would you eat GMO or food produced by GMOs?</I> The optional answers given were <I>yes, no, maybe, I donât think so,</I> and <I>I donât know</I>. We received a total
number of 259 completed questionnaires where the answers were as follow; 43.66 % <I>yes</I>, 8.11 % <I>no</I>, 
33.98 % <I>maybe</I>, 8.11 % <I>I donât think so</I> and 6.18 % <I>I donât know</I>. 
As mentioned above, GMOs are organisms where the DNA has been modified; some people might even 
claim that it has been tampered with. It is important to note, that many people are unfamiliar with the 
procedure of genetical modification. This perhaps leads to skepticism or the development of fear for the 
unknown. The distribution of answers to the question <I>Would it be an ethical issue to offer GMO as 
relief aid for hunger-stricken countries?</I> showed that 16.22% of all participants answered <I>yes</I> or <I>maybe</I>. But 
is it only the ignorance, which means that people are hostile towards GMOs? 
Or could it be the opposite case, namely that people with knowledge of GMOs are afraid of the risks and 
hazards that genetically modification brings? Furthermore, could those people be brought to change their 
minds if they were guaranteed a safe system for humans and the environment?</P><P><SPAN class="intro">Life is full of</SPAN> daily risks, which have to be counterbalanced against each other and against potential benefits.

A well-known term that describes this tendency is âzero riskâ, which indicates prospects without risks.
Demands of âzero riskâ are not realistic and although these opinions does not necessarily belong to the 
general population, it has become increasingly important to communicate the risks to the public about

As synthetic biologists we know that genes consists of four bases, Thymine, Guanine, Adenine and Cytosine, and we know that the difference between genes lies in the sequence of these four bases alone. Nevertheless specific 
genes, like genes from animals, might be unethical to use in GMOâs as it would be disrespectful towards 
vegans, vegetarians, religious groups etc. 

Would people, who for various reasons does not eat meat, accept to eat a product containing genes from 
an animal? Is the use of animal genes in GMOs a real ethical issue, or is this exclusively an example of lack 
of knowledge? These questions are important for the continued research.<SPAN class="intro"><I>Would the use of</I></SPAN><I>GMOs in the agricultural industries have an impact on the job market or cultural traditions?</I> 
As mentioned above, genetically modified organisms can bring pivotal advantages to the agriculture
and food industry. The production may expand with larger quantities and more uniform breeding, 
which has worked as an encouragement of approving GMOs in the agricultural 
<SPAN class="sourceReference">industry.</SPAN><SPAN class="tooltip"><SPAN class="tooltipHeader">Source:</SPAN>

But what would happen if GMOs were approved for all
industries? Would it result in the optimal exploitation of our resources and would it lead to the best and 
largest quantities of the food production? Maybe it would. But maybe it would also lead to loss of jobs, as 
the breeding is easier and more successful. Furthermore smaller companies and private farmers might be 
forced to produce larger quantities and better products, as they otherwise could not keep up with the rapid 
growth and development of the food producing industry.<SPAN class="intro">In other respects, the permission of</SPAN> GMOs in agricultural industry might lead to the creation of more new jobs, for example within the research industry. GMOs also require environmental safeguards that must be 
performed by educated experts. In that way, it could encourage to higher educational levels in some 
countries, and thereby high probability of getting a job afterwards.<SPAN class="intro">It has been valuable for our iGEM team</SPAN> to work on constructing an edible coli where so many ethical considerations come into play. To begin with the idea of creating a nutrition source based on non-digestible materials for human beings seemed as the good deed of the day, but it did not take long before this viewpoint changed due to reflections.
It came to our attention that scientists play a major role in the dissemination of new scientific proposals. The reason for this is the importance of a good integration of the proposal, but also because of the impact it can have on peoples lives.
On our ethics course in Copenhagen and through the trip to Ghana, we began to reflect upon how our targeted consumers would welcome our proposal. Whether they would see it as much-needed help or as a deamination of their needs and we realized that maybe not all people would welcome the idea with open arms.
Our ethical considerations have made us look at our project from several new angles and opened our eyes to both the good and the more problematic aspects of our project.
