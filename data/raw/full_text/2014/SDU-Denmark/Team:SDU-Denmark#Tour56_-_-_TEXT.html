Manuscript
Boy walks into a burger joint and orders a cheeseburger.
1.
Burger with or without bacteria?
Burger mama:
”Hello there, kid.”
Boy:
”Hello there, burger mama.”
Burger mama:
”What can I do for you today, mister?”
Boy:
”I would like one juicy cheeseburger, please.”
Burger mama:
”Okay then, coming right up. Do you want it with or without bacteria?”
(Boy looks confused into camera – CHOICE: 1.1 or 1.2)
1.1
With:
Burger mama:
”Well, I couldn’t really prevent your burger from containing bacteria either, since there are  bacteria everywhere. If we imagined a bacteria free or sterile burger, this would be ruined  already after your first touch and breath on it, since bacteria is a big and important part of  the environment on your skin and in your mouth. Source: Microbiology online: Bacteria. (Link)
In addition to this, you would have to lose the cheese in cheeseburger. The cheesemaking  process, apparently, involves fermentation of milk, which is performed by lactic acid  bacteria. These converts milk sugar into lactic acid. When the lactic acid accumulates, the  structure of milk proteins changes and this causes texture of the product. Source: European Food Information Council, 1999: Lactic acid bacteria – their uses in food. (Link)
At least somebody told me so.”
Boy:
”I could never lose the cheese!”
(Boy gets burger)
To 1.1.1
1.2
Without:
Burger mama:
”Well, we just give it some time in the autoclave then, to sterilize this bad boy.”
(Autoclaving burger)
(Boy grabs burger and reaches his mouth with it – Burger mama takes it out of his hands  instantly)
”Well, you can’t eat this now, since you contaminated it with your hands and breath.”
(*BOOM* to the classroom)
Professor:
”Did you know that bacteria are found everywhere. Relatively few are bad for your health  and can cause diseases – most are thought to be harmless and some even necessary for  your body’s function. Bacteria are considered microorganisms and can’t be seen with the  human eye. The human body consists of approximately 10 times as many bacterial cells as  human cells – many of these are found lining the gastrointestinal tract. The surface of the  human body, like the intestines, mouth and skin, is thus covered inside and out with millions  of microorganisms, known as our normal body flora, which in fact helps to protect us from  infectious microorganisms. Source: Microbiology online: Bacteria. (Link)
At the same time, the air we breathe is full of bacteria as well. Largely by stirring up material from the floor, left by previous persons’ attendance, a person can add about 37 million  bacteria to the air every hour, just by his or her mere presence in a room. Source: Gershon, E.: With you in the room, bacteria counts spike. Yale News, 2012. (Link)
In addition to this, the manufacturing of many food products involves the activity of different  microorganisms. Cheesemaking involves fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria, and a  yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes the expansion of dough for making bread, by  its fermentation of sugar to carbon oxide gas. Source: European Food Information Council, 1999: Lactic acid bacteria – their uses in food. (Link)
So for instance this burger, you were just trying to buy, could never be made without containing bacteria.”
Boy:
”Oh, nasty shit. But I understand – bacteria are kind of awesome then!”
(*BOOM* to burger joint)
To 1.2.1
1.1.1
French fries with or without DNA?*
Boy:
”Oh, burger mama. I forgot to order some french fries with my burger.”
Burger mama:
”Coming up, boy. But do you want them with or without DNA?”
(Boy looks confused into camera – CHOICE: 1.1.2 or 1.1.3)
1.1.2
With:
Burger mama:
”Well, good choice there boy. I’m not sure I really could make you any french fries without DNA, since french fries are made of potatoes and potatoes are tubers from a tuberous crop.  Plants consist of cells and every cell contains DNA, which makes french fries full of DNA, I  think?!”
(Burger mama shows french frie → potato → potato plant)
Boy:
”Yeah, that’s what I thought too.”
(Boy gets french fries)
Burger mama:
”But kid, can you tell me what exactly DNA is?”
(Boy looks confused into camera – CHOICE – 1.1.2.1 or 1.1.2.1)
1.1.2.1
Yes:
Boy:
”DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. It is a macromolecule found in every cell, forming a living organism. DNA encodes genes, a given cell and organism’s characteristics, by the  sequence of four different bases; Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine. It’s also the  genetic inheritance of every cell and living organism, since these genes can be passed on to  the next generation.” Source: Berg, J., Tymoczko, J.L., and Stryer, L.: Biochemistry, Seventh Edition. W.H.Freeman & Co Ltd, 2011
Burger mama:
”Well, that is truly awesome! You’re a clever fella, huh?!”
To 2.
1.1.2.2
No:
(*BOOM* to the classroom)
Professor:
”Did you know that DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid? It’s a macromolecule, found in every cell of every living organism. It consists of sugar, phosphate and four different  bases; Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine. These four bases are found bound to each  other in pairs; A-T and G-C. The DNA molecule is shaped like a double helix, in which two  phosphorous sugar backbones are held together by the base pairs, like steps on a ladder. The  sequence of the bases encodes genes, the specific cell and organism’s characteristics, which  can be inherited to the next generation. Source: Berg, J., Tymoczko, J.L., and Stryer, L.: Biochemistry, Seventh Edition. W.H.Freeman & Co Ltd, 2011
So since most food products are made from living organisms, all vegetables and meat for instance, many food products will contain DNA. It would be impossible to avoid eating DNA.”
Boy:
”Cool!”
(*BOOM* to burger joint)
To 2.
1.1.3
Without:
Burger mama:
”But why not?”
(Boy looks confused into camera – CHOICE: 1.1.3.1, 1.1.3.2, 1.1.3.3 or 1.1.3.4)
1.1.3.1
Unhealthy:
Burger mama:
”I don’t think that juicy cheeseburger is any better.”
To 1.1.3.5
1.1.3.2
Disgusting:
Burger mama:
”Well, you’re a picky young man, huh?!”
To 1.1.3.5
1.1.3.3
Dangerous:
Burger mama:
”Wopwopwop, I don’t really believe that’s entirely true.”
To 1.1.3.5
1.1.3.4
Don't know?:
Burger mama:
”Young man, you can’t go on in life, being so indecisive and indifferent. Just some useful  advice from your old burger mama.”
To 1.1.3.5
1.1.3.5
DNA
(*BOOM* to the classroom)
Professor:
”Did you know that every living organism consists of one or more cells, and that every cell contains DNA?
DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. It is a macromolecule consisting of sugar, phosphate  and four different bases; Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine.

So these french fries, you were just trying to buy, actually contain a whole lot of DNA, like most other food products, all vegetables and meat for instance. French fries are made of  potatoes and potatoes are tubers of a potato plant. Plants are considered living organisms,  and thus consists of cells that all contain DNA. It would be impossible for you to order french  fries without DNA.”
Boy:
”Oh! I see. DNA doesn’t do any harm. I would like some french fries anyways then.”
(*BOOM* back to burger joint. Boy gets french fries)
Burger mama:
”There you go, boy.”

1.2.1
New burger?
Burger mama:
”Would you like a new burger? – You will have to pay double though, of course.”
(Boy looks confused into camera – CHOICE: 1.2.2 or 1.2.3)
1.2.2
Yes:
Burger mama:
”Sensible decision, kid. It would have been absolutely gross, if you decided to be a stingy fella and eat this nasty bastard.”
(Boy gets new burger)
Boy:
”Yeah, this is better!”
To 1.1.1*
1.2.3
No:
Burger mama:
”Okay then. That’s your decision. I’m just glad it isn’t me who have to eat that nasty bastard!”
(Boy touches burger and throws it out)
Boy:
”Oh, I won’t eat it either. This is a flabby excuse for a cheeseburger. I changed my mind,  burger mama – can you get me a new one, please. Extra cheese then, if I have to pay  double!”
Burger mama:
”All right, kid. That’s a deal.”
(Boy gets burger)
To 1.1.1*

GMO
(Scared woman runs past boy and burger mama in burger joint)
Scared woman:
”Save me, save me. Save all of us! The GMO is coming. It’s following me. It’s taking me. Aarrh!”
(Scared woman disappears/runs out of burger joint again. Burger mama looks confused at  boy)
Burger mama:
”What the f***! That was weird. I don’t even know what this GMO is. Do you?”
(Boy looks confused into camera – CHOICE: 2.1 or 2.2)
2.1
Yes:
Boy:
”Sure. GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism. Genetic modification can serve to  induce several new qualities into an organism by introducing new genes to its native DNA  material. Genetic modification is for instance used on crops in farming to ensure a high yield  production. GMOs also include microorganisms. Even if genetically modified microorganisms  were to escape into nature, they can be programmed with sophisticated kill switches, making  them unfit to survive outside a controlled environment. Ironically, different microorganisms  produce antibiotics by fermentation and are therefore used in the medical industry – these  microorganisms are then genetically modified to yield maximum production.” Source: Nielsen , J.: Betydningen af systembiologi for industriel bioteknologi. Biozoom, 2007. Vol. 2, p. 1-3. (Link)
Burger mama:
”Kid, you really amaze me with all that brain juice flowing from you!”
To 3
2.2
No:
(*BOOM* to the classroom)
Professor:
”Did you know that GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism? Genetic modification  is a gene technology, which is used to change the genetics and thus the properties of an  organism, either by removing genes or introducing new genes to its native DNA material.  In this way, genetic modification can be used to induce several new characteristics into an  organism, for instance crops in farming, to ensure a high yield production. Source: GMO Compass, 2006: GM Microorganisms Taking the Place of Chemical Factories. (Link)
GMOs can also be microorganisms. Even if genetically modified microorganisms were to escape into nature, they can be programmed with sophisticated kill switches, making them  unfit to survive outside a controlled environment. Genetically modified microorganisms  are especially used in the medical industry. Different microorganisms produce antibiotics  by fermentation – these microorganisms are then genetically modified to yield maximum  production. Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company, also uses a modified fungus,  the Aspergillus oryzae, in the production of their main commodity; insulin.” Source: Novo Nordisk: Use of gene technology at Novo Nordisk. (Link)
Boy:
”Wow. I actually got diabetes – so I’m kind of fond of the genetically modified microorganisms at the moment!”

Lemonade produced by GMO?
Boy:
”Burger mama, I think I got some thirst going on. Can you hand me a lemonade as well,  please?”
Burger mama:
”Of course, boy. But can your lemonade be produced by GMO?
(Boy looks confused into camera – CHOICE: 3.1 or 3.2)
3.1
Yes:
Boy:
”Well, since GMOs can produce antibiotics, they could as well produce my lemonade, I guess. I think I’ve heard that genetically modified microorganisms produce lots of food  additives, vitamins and flavors as well. I see lemonade contains the additive E330, citric acid,  which is part of many microorganisms metabolic pathway. To make an economically viable  production, a given microorganism should just be modified for an optimized metabolic flux of  the citric acid?” Source: Sauer, M., et al.: Microbial production of organic acids: expanding the market. Elsevier, 2008. Cell Press, vol. 26:2, p. 100-108. (Link)
Buger mama:
”I’ve heard that citric acid can be produced by the mold, Aspergillus niger.”
Boy:
”Well, there you go! Can I have my lemonade then?”
Buger mama:
”Mmhmm.”
(Boy gets lemonade)
To 4
3.2
No:
(*BOOM* to the classroom)
Professor:
”Did you know that many food products, for instance this lemonade you were just trying to  buy, contain additives that in cases are produced by genetically modified microorganisms?”
(Zooming in on lemonade declaration)
”E330, citric acid, can be produced by the mold, Aspergillus niger, and E300, ascorbic acid, or better known as vitamin C, can be produced by several bacteria, Gluconobacter oxydans as an example. Different products might already be part of the microorganisms metabolism,  and the microorganisms have then been genetically engineered for an optimized metabolic  flux to be economically viable producers. Source: Hancock, R.D.: Recent Patents on Vitamin C: Opportunities for Crop Improvement and Single-Step Biological Manufacture. Recent Patents on Food, Nutrition & Agriculture, 2009. Vol. 1, p. 39-49. (Link)   Source: Sauer, M., et al.: Microbial production of organic acids: expanding the market. Elsevier, 2008. Cell Press, vol. 26:2, p. 100-108. (Link)
It is advantageous to use genetically modified microorganisms for industrial production of  several additives, vitamins and flavors, because of their rapid growth, and in most cases, easy  cultivation. The microbial production is also more environmentally friendly than conventional  methods, since the microorganisms don’t need harsh chemicals, high temperatures or  pressures, and thus uses less energy.” Source: GMO Compass, 2006: GM Microorganisms Taking the Place of Chemical Factories. (Link)
Boy:
”Oh!”
(*BOOM* to burger joint)
Boy:
”Well, burger mama. I got really thirsty from all this talk about bacteria, DNA and GMO. I could really use that lemonade anyway.”
Burger mama:
”You got it!”

Boy and friend - iGEM
Boy:
”Thanks a lot for the service and talk, burger mama.”
Burger mama:
”Thank you. Enjoy your food and come again soon.”
(Boy waves at burger mama and friend arrives)
Friend:
”What’up, bro? What took you so long?” Boy:
”I’ve had the craziest time ordering. Burger mama made me consider a lot of weird stuff  regarding my food.”
Friend:
”Like what?”
Boy:
”Whether I wanted it to contain bacteria, DNA and be produced by GMO. And then there was  this hysterical man, running around afraid of GMO!”
Friend:
”Arh, GMO. Ha, that’s funny. You know, it makes me think of this friend of mine. He’s doing some project at the moment – have you heard about iGEM before?”
(Boy looks confused into camera – CHOICE: 4.1 or 4.2)
4.1
Yes:
Friend:
”Oh, cool. It sounds really exciting! You know, my friend I told you about, he’s part of the  SDU iGEM team 2014. They’re trying to make a bacteria that utilizes an otherwise non- degradable source for humans, like cellulose, to produce a wonder protein, containing the  required ratio of essential amino acids for humans, and to produce essential fatty acids, like  omega-3 and omega-6. It’s some of the optimal nutrition a human needs. At the same time,  they will make it taste good! It’s an Edible coli!”
Boy:
”Wow. That sounds truly amazing!”
Friend:
”If you like, we can go find the SDU iGEM team 2014?”
(Boy looks confused into camera – CHOICE: 5. or 6.)
4.2
No:
Friend:
”iGEM stands for International Genetically Engineered Machine. It’s a worldwide synthetic biology competition, founded by MIT, Boston. The competition initially aimed at  undergraduate university students, but has now expanded to include a high school division  and an entrepreneurship division. The goal of every team is to design and build their own  biological system and operate them in living cells – a genetically engineered machine.
