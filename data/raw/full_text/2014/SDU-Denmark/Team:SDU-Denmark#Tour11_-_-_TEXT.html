Team description from the early days
We are a very ambitious group of 9 students from five different disciplines: medicine, biomedicine, biochemistry and molecular biology, mathematics and chemical engineering. Because we didn’t know each other before the team was formed, we expected to evolve as a group and learn to use our differences - both professionally and personally - to achieve a synergetic teamwork. We have big expectations for the team, the competition and ourselves. We are prepared to use our holidays (and the only sunny months in Denmark) to work hard on a meaningful project that will, hopefully, be of use to someone. We want to do this in order to get more practical experience and have a good time with other engaged students. Some of us have never been in the lab before, and others feel that the scheduled lab-exercises in our studies are just too predictable. At this point, we wish to design a project that will span the subjects of synthetic biology, characterization, mathematical modeling and simulation of a biological system as well as a broader outreach to the general public.

Want more? Go to iGEM.org!
If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads   on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe   join a team yourself?
