“Don’t cry because it’s over. Smile because it happened!” – Dr. Seuss
Writing this on the night of the wiki-freeze sure brings a lot of thoughts – what are we supposed  to do with our spare time now? What else could you get E. coli to produce? WHAT ARE WE GOING  TO DO IN ORDER TO SAVE THE WORLD NOW?
Well, we do not know the answers but one thing is certain: Our iGEM project, working in the lab,  getting to know each other and work together – preparing for Boston – the whole process has  been a great experience in every thinkable way. We are grateful and will like to thank everyone  who has helped and everyone who have put up with our immense mood swings and non-existing  circadian rhythm.
We now look forward to present our project at the Giant Jamboree and hearing about all the other iGEM projects.
Thank you for reading our team wiki – we hope you enjoyed the tour!

If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads   on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe   join a team yourself?
