Edible coli
What do we need? - What does Edible coli provide?
Food pyramid in a world with Edible coli, which could possibly provide the optmimal quantity of protein and fat, essential for human beings.
The human body needs more than calories. To live a healthy and long life it is essential to be well nourished, which means to get all the essential nourishment in the right ratio. WHO (World Health  Organization) recommends at least 55% carbohydrates, Source: FAO/WHO Expert Consultation: Carbohydrates in the human nutrition. FAO Food and Nutrition Paper, 1997. Vol. 66: Carbohydrates in the diet. (Link) 20-35% fats, Source: FAO Expert Consultation: Fats and fatty acids in human nutrition. FAO Food and Nutrition Paper, 2010. Vol. 91: p. 11- 12. (Link) and 10-20% proteins Source: WHO/FAO/UNU Expert Consultation: Protein and Amino Acid Requirement in Human Nutrition. WHO Technical Report Series, 2007. Vol. 935. (Link) in an adult human daily diet.
Carbohydrates are digested to glucose molecules in the human gut. From here they travel into the blood system and are transported all around the body. Muscles use glucose as an energy source by degrading it  through heat producing processes. Remaining amounts of glucose are stored as glycogen in the liver or as  fatty acids in adipose tissue, which allow us to maintain the needed blood sugar level during starvation.
Proteins are made of amino acids that act as the major building blocks for all enzymes and proteins in the  human body. Furthermore proteins are a structural component of bones, muscles and the immune system.  There are 20 common amino acids, from which 10 are essential, which means that the human body is  unable to synthesize them and we need to get them through the diet.
Fats are built up by long carbon chains and function as an energy source. Fats can be stored in the adipose tissue where it insulates the body and protects organs against pressure and stress. Additionally, some  fats are of vital importance as they are involved in the uptake of fat-soluble essential vitamins. Source: Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012: Nutrition for everyone. (Link)
Too much or too little of one of the three food sources mentioned above can lead to change in weight,  weakness, health problems, disease and undernourishment. Children can even be stunted or wasted. Source: NHC, 2011: Symptoms of malnutrition. (Link)
The optimal quantity of fat- and protein nutrients could potentially be provided by Edible coli, since it contains essential fatty acids and a nutritional protein, the OneProt, that includes the recommended ratio of  essential amino acids recommended by the World Health Organization, WHO.

Want more? Go to iGEM.org!
If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads   on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe   join a team yourself?
