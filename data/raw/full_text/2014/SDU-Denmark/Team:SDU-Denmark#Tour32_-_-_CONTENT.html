We learned basics, as running a PCR, and where we can find everything that is needed for working in the lab. In addition, we talked a lot about the project goals and the way of getting there.

PCR reactions on TetR, both to include constitutive promoter, RBS and terminator, and to include the same elements, but remove LVA-tag, and on GFP generator to include Tet promoter, RBS and terminator.

PCR1: Const.P-RBS-TetR(-LVA)-term.
PCR2: Const.P-RBS-TetR(+LVA)-term.
PCR3: Tetp-RBS-GFP-term.
</P><H5>Tuesday 17/6 </H5><P> In the lab: The PCR reactions from yeasterday didn't work, so they were repeated. This time 50 µL PCR reaction were prepared. Gel purification was performed on the PCR products and the final concentration was measured by nanodrop. 

We digested the products by using restriction enzymes, XbaI og SpeI. We detected that the plasmid was only linearized, meaning that only one restriction enzyme/restriction site was functional.

We worked on the basics in the iGEM concept. We discussed the definitions of biobrick, basis part, composite part and devices. We learned the &quot;Standard Assembly Method&quot;, it's condition, uses and limitations.

We defined the conditions for our own device and started searching for the necessary parts in the iGEM registry.</P><H5>Wednesday 18/6 </H5><P>We digested two plasmids, 161 and RFP, each with the enzymes XbaI and EcoRI. Unfortunately it didn’t work as expected, as XbaI did not cut. We made some control experiments to check this and concluded that one of the plasmids might miss the EcoRI restriction site.

The results after running it on a gel shows that somethings wrong with the plasmid, 161, since Xbai doesn't digest it, but digests plasmid, RFP. Since EcoRI digests, we can conclude that there's something wrong with the plasmid's XbaI restriction site.

Several control experiments with the XbaI enzyme was made - another borrowed Xbai enzyme was tested as well. Since the borrowed enzyme worked, the other was tossed out. Conclusion: We're buying a new one!

We recieved lab safety training.</P><H5>Friday 20/6 </H5><P>Team page and Notebook page added to the wiki.

Two PCR reactions were made to amplify plasmids from the iGEM 2014 kit. The gel, that was run afterwards, showed bands in the right length. The bands were cut out and purified.</P><H5>Saturday 21/6 </H5><P>All the pipettes were calibrated </P><P>A K12 MG1655 strain was plated out on agar, to colonize overnight, in order for us to produce more plasmid later on.</P><H5>Sunday 22/6 </H5><P>One bacterial colony from the agar plate from yesterday was transferred to fluid LB media to amplify WT bacteria. 
TSB buffer was made.
A transformation was made.</P><H4>Week 26 (23/6 - 29/6)</H4><H5>Monday 23/6</H5><P>The transformation from yesterday has not been successful.</P><P>New plates with Ampicilin, Kanamycin and Chloramphenicol were made.</P><H5>Wednesday 25/6</H5><P> A transformation was made.</P><H5>Thursday 26/6</H5><P>The transformation from yesterday has been partly successful. One plate had no colonies. For the transformations that were successful an ON was made.</P><P>The cultures should be prepared for storage at -80°C tomorrow.</P><H5>Friday 27/6</H5><P>Freezing stocks were made out of the ON from yesterday. The samples were then stored at -80°C.</P><H5>Saturday 28/6</H5><P>The non-successful transformation from Wednesday 25/6 was repeated.</P><H5>Sunday 29/6</H5><P>The transformation was partially successful. There were some, but very few, visible colonies on the agar plates. Two overnight cultures were prepared from one colony respectively.</P><H4>Week 27 (30/6 - 6/7)</H4><H5>Monday 30/6</H5><P>The overnight culture was not red, as expected, which means that something was wrong with the plasmid. Therefore a new overnight culture was prepared, so that a Colony PCR can be performed on the cultures. Furthermore an overnight culture was prepared of the wild type <I>E. coli</I> strain, so that it can be used for transformation tomorrow.</P><H5>Tuesday 1/7</H5><P>Today a Colony PCR was performed on the <I>E. coli</I> MG1655 strains with the plasmids: pSB1A3, pSB1C3, pSB1K3 and J04450 (also known as aza). The results showed that the constructs all had approximately the same weight, just below 1500 bp. This corresponds to the theoretical weight of the constructs, which is 1382 bp.</P><P>The development of the construct used to produce lacI was commenced. This was done by first running Phusion PCR on lacI (BBa_I732100, Template 8A, Plate 3). The PCR product was then analysed on gel-electrophoresis and purified.</P><P>Transformation was performed on the plasmids pSB1C3 and pSB1K3 as the former transformation was unsuccessful. Furthermore transformation was also performed on the parts BBa_R0010 (lacP promoter) and BBa_E0840 (GFP coding seq.). The transformed <I>E. coli</I> were put on agar plates with antibiotic according to their respective resistance. The plates were placed in the heating cabinet and should be examined for colonies tomorrow.</P><H5>Wednesday 2/7</H5><P>Because the PCR on lacI from yesterday yielded a low concentration, Phusion PCR was repeated today, where both the PCR product from yesterday and BBa_I732100 from iGEM were used as template. The results showed that the PCR product from yesterday was too short and still yielded a low concentration. While the PCR reaction with BBa_I732100 as template produced a higher concentration of lacI.</P><P>The transformation on the parts BBa_R0010 (lacP promoter) and BBa_E0840 (GFP coding seq.) from yesterday was unsuccesful so the experiment was repeated today.</P><P>Freezing stocks of <I>E. coli</I> with pSB1C3 and pSB1K3 were stored at -80°C. Each culture were mixed with 50% glycerol</P><P>Furthermore fast digest on our 3 PCR products were made with XbaI and SpeI.</P><P>PCR 1 and 3 were ligated and PCR 2 and 3 were ligated.</P><H5>Thursday 3/7 </H5><P>Today the ligated PCR1/3 and PCR2/3 were purified by running them through a gel. The concentration of the purified constructs were measured by nano drop.</P><P>In order to create &quot;sticky ends&quot; on PCR1/3 and PCR2/3, the parts were fast digested. Also pSB1C3 was fast digested, so that it could be used as a backbone. The different fast digested parts were gel purified. PCR1/3 and PCR2/3 were then ligated to the backbone (pSB1C3).</P><P>Colony PCR was performed on a colony from the  transformation from Wednesday 2/7 of the lacP promoter (BBa_R0010) and GFP coding seq. (BBa_E0840). The gel showed bands that were too long, therefore a new colony PCR was performed on a different colony. The results from the new colony PCR were the same as before, with the weight of GFP just above 1000 bp and the weight of lacP promoter just around 500 bp.</P><H5>Friday 4/7</H5><P>A miniprep was performed on the ON containing lacP promoter (BBa_R0010) and GFP coding seq. (BBa_E0840), and a freezing stock was made.</P><P>Furthermore a PCR was made on the products from the miniprep. Unfortunatly the PCR didn't work, as the gel didn't show any products.</P><P>Because the PCR didn't work we found the products from the iGEM kit from 2014 and made a new PCR.</P><P>This time the  PCR worked and the products were gel purified and the concentrations meassured with NanoDrop.</P><H5>Saturday 5/7</H5><P>PCR was preformed on LVA less GFP with tet promoter using primers yellow#8 and yellow#9. The PCR was purified using the gel purification SOP.</P><P>A digest was done on PCR products #11 and #12 in an attempt to ligate these. Ligation was done in 30 mins at RT whereupon the ligase was inactivated at 65 °C for 10 mins. Purification of the ligation product was done, diverging from the SOP and resulting in an unusable amount of product.</P><H5>Sunday 6/7</H5><P>The lacP promoter (BBa_R0010)and GFP coding seq. (BBa_E0840) have been ligated but the concentration was low and therefore we made PCR on the product.</P><P>The PCR product was run on a gel. The band was hard to separate from other bands around the same length (1400bp). We cut out the right length and purified it. Nanodrop was measured. </P><P>PCR1 (consisting of template 2:2P) and PCR2 (consisting of template 2:2P) have both been fast digested with SpeI. PCR3 (consisting of template 2:24D) has been fast digested with XbaI. PCR1 and PCR3 were attempted ligated (for 30 min) and so were PCR2 and PCR3. These ligations did not show any bands around the expected length during gel purification. Two new ligations (of the same), with higher concentrations of digested PCR products, are reacting overnight.</P><H4>Week 28 (7/7 - 13/7)</H4><H5>Monday 7/7</H5><P>We realized that we have to step back in the process by inserting the different parts we want to ligate into a plasmid before ligating them to each other.</P><P>Therefore we started our day in the lab by doing a PCR reaction on PCR1 (consisting of template 2:2P) and PCR2 (consisting of template 2:2P). Unfortunately PCR2 didn't show the right band length when run on gel.</P><P>PCR was also done on the lacP promoter (BBa_R0010)and GFP coding seq. (BBa_E0840). The sequences machted the lenght seen on the gel. The band from the gel was cut out and purified.</P><P>PCR1, PCR3 and LacP were digested.</P><H5>Tuesday 8/7</H5><P> The digested products from yesterday were purified.</P><P>Furthermore PCR on PCR 2 was repeated, this time with a gradient spanding from 53°C - 58°C. Our results were good this time.
The products were purified and their concentrations were meassured with NanoDrop.</P><H5>Wednesday 9/7</H5><P> Tet construct: 
Plasmid pSB1C3 was concentrated before it was digested with the enzymes Xbai and SpeI. The plasmid was ligated with digested PCR1, PCR2 and PCR3.</P>

Lac Construct:
<LI>Pcon_rbs_LacI(withoutLVA)_term, BBa_C0012, was digested with EcoRI and SpeI</LI><LI>GFP, BBa_E0840 in plasmid has beed ligated</LI><LI>LacP, BBa_R0010, was ligated with our C part in plasmid</LI>The ligated products were transformed.<H5>Thursday 10/7</H5><P>The transformation from yesterday was successful. Colony PCR was performed on all transformations. The result showed that part B (Bba_R0010) and C (Bba_E0840) had been ligated successfully. Unfortunately nothing could be seen on the gel with regard to PCR1, PCR2 and PCR3. Therefore a new colony PCR was performed on different colonies with PCR1, PC2 and PCR3. The gel showed no or no proper bands, so we concluded, that a religation must have happened.
Therefore we checked our enzymes by digesting pSB1C3. Here we could conclude that something must be wrong with XbaI, as it does not cut.</P> An ON was made containing BC construct.<H5>Friday 11/7</H5><P> XbaI was doublechecked and we found out, that the enzyme does not cut when using the green Fast Digest buffer.</P><P>We puridied our PCR1 (Pcon_rbs_BBa_C0040(LVAtag_removed)_term) and PCR3 (Ptet_BBa_E0840) and digested these while using the colorless buffer. 
Furthermore PCR1, PCR2 and PCR3 were amplified by a PCR reaction.</P>ON containing BC contruct was miniprepped and run on a gel together with C in plasmid. The length of the bands were compared and seemed appropiate. 
Anyway, to be sure, a PCR was made on the BC construct. This time the gel showed too short bands, which could mean, that the C in plasmid has religated.

After running the PCR on a gel, no clear, correct bands showed. This was due to the primers, which had a too high concentration, thus they were diluted.
<P> After the dilution, a touch down PCR was made, starting at 66 deg. going 1 deg. lower per cycle for 10 cycles, thus ending at 56 deg. A gel showed a clear band with the correct bands. In order for us to have a high enough concentration of PCR1 &amp; PCR2 for ligation, we ran a PCR with the program: 1:98 deg., 2 min. 2: 98 deg., 10 sec. 3: 50 deg., 30 sec. 4: 72 deg., 2 sec. 5: GO TO 2 rep 30. 6: 72 deg., 5 min.
</P><P> after running a gel with the PCR products, bands showed with the wrong lenghts that wasn't religation. Thus we concluded that the PCR1 and PCR2 used was incorrect.

/Anne and Jens Jakob
</P><H5>Saturday 13/9</H5><P>
USER PCR on Fat2, Δ12, Δ9 and B. The reaction run as a gradient PCR - this didn't work. Only a mysterious and weak band at around 2000 bp shows for all the reactions.

/Signe

Colony PCR on transformations from yesterday showed some success - ON was made on ABC2 and A-plasmid.

Something went wrong with the PCR maschine in wihch the colony PCR reactions for TetR and the protein was run. The product was all dried out when this was discovered. A new colony PCR with this was made, and also with new colonies from transformation of PCR1/3 and PCR2/3, since the last result of these were pretty wierd. 
The new colony PCR showed succes for all 4 types.
/Jens Jakob

Digest of pBad with E+S, and IB and KB with E+X - this was purified. Both IB and KB was ligated with pBad (but every digest had very low concentration).

ON of TetR, protein PCR1/3 and PCR2/3, single colony plate streaks from yesterday, has been made.
/Daniel

Single colony plate streaks were made yesterday. Another colony PCR reaction was run on these, since it contained different cultures (white and green) - with VF2 and specifik reverse primer, and VR and specifik forward primer. The results showed that all colonies contained GFP, but not all contained TetR. ONs were made on 6 colonies, with and without doxycycline. 
Result: The colonies that were green before, was green in the ONs as well - with and without doxycycline.
/Jens Jakob

Transformation of TIB, TKB and Tetp-protein in odor free bacterial cells. The cells were transformed at OD600 = 0,3 with 0,5 µl of plasmid.
/Jens Jakob
</P><H5>Sunday 12/10</H5>
Most of the plates from yesterday, were covered in a carpet of bacteria, but we succeeded in extracting 4 single colonies from the edges of the plate of TIB and T-Prot.
Colony PCR were performed on 4 colonies from each plate, and they were plated out on new Cm-plates. The colony PCR ran with VF2 and VR primers at 49 deg with 2.30 min elongation time. 
Something went wrong with the colony PCR and no bands were observed on the gel. Not even the usual primer dimers in the bottom. This indicates that either the primers, polymerase or the Cm-plates haven't been working.
The primers were investigated by running a PCR on a mini-prepped plasmid with MyTaq polymerase. Bands were observed on the gel, which confirmes that neither the primers or the polymerase was faulty. 
A transformation on TIB, TKB and Tet-Prot into the odor free strain, YYC912, were performed once again.
TIB:    0,25 µl and 0,50 µl
TKB:    0,50 µl and 1,00 µl
T-Prot: 0,50 µl and 1,00 µl
Furthermore PCR 1/3 and PCR 2/3 were transformed again, as earlier this week, and it was sent to be sequenced. They were transformed into competent WT cells. They were all plated on a different batch of plates, than what was used last.
/Jens Jakob
<H5>Monday 13/10 </H5>
Double antibiotic plates were created with 30γ chloramphenicol and doxycycline at different concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 ng/ml). PCR 1/3, PCR 2/3, PCR 3 and a WT w/ empty vector was plated on them. 
ON-cultures of WT, WT w/ empty vector, PCR 1/3, PCR 2/3 and PCR 3 was prepared for a growth experiment the day after. Biological triplicates were created. 
/Martin
Colony PCR was performed on the transformations from yesterday of TIB, TKB and Tet-Prot into the odor free strain, YYC912. The gel showed no real bands, and hence the tranforsmations didn't succeed.
/Jens Jakob

<H5>Tuesday 14/10 </H5>
Another growth experiment was started. Today with WT, WT w/ empty vector, PCR 1/3, PCR 2/3 and PCR 3. This time we had moved the experiment to another part of the lab, and had no issues with dropping OD600 values.
42 samples for western blot was prepared. Dublicates PCR 1/3, PCR 2/3 and PCR 3 at 7 different doxycycline concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 ng/ml).
M9 minimal media was prepared, and ON-cultures of TIB, TKB, WT and the odor free strain YYC912 in the minimal media was put in the incubator with aeration.
Furthermore, additional SDS-PAGE gels was created.
/Martin

<H5>Wednesday 15/10 </H5>

We received 4 NGM plates for C. elegans. We smeared 1 ml of WT and Tet-Protein cultures on the plates, and let them set in the cabinet overnight.
The ON-cultures from yesterday was run through our new IMS, and we are super excited to see the new data it can produce. Furthermore a double blinded scent test was performed on TIB, TKB, WT and YYC912 with people not aware of what the project was about.
/Martin

<H5>Thursday 16/10 </H5>

Another growth experiment, this time with our Protein and the odor free strain YYC912.
A heatshock stress test was performed on C. elegans on the plates prepared yesterday.
A western blot was prepared as well.
