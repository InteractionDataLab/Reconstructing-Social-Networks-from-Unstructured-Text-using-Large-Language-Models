"Feeling gratitude and not expressing it, is like wrapping a present and not giving it." - William Arthur Ward
Sponsors
We would like to thank our sponsor The University of Southern Denmark , for funding our iGEM project. Especially we would like to thank dean Henrik  Pedersen and the Faculty of Science at University of Southern Denmark - we are  truly grateful for having this amazing possibility.
Laboratory support
We would like to thank Associate Professor, Ph. D. Jakob Møller Jensen and the Microbiology group and also the rest of the Department of Biochemistry  and Molecular Biology for letting us use their lab, providing laboratory  equipment and guidance throughout our project.
Our instructors Academic Assistant Tina Kronborg, post doc Ann Zahle Andersen, stud.cand. Patrick Rosendahl Andreassen, stud.cand. Andreas Kjær and stud.cand. Thøger Jensen  Krogh have adviced us the entire summer when crying for help. We are really grateful for all your  advice in every situation.
Ph.D. fellow Maria Storm Mollerup helped us with general questions in the lab.
Academic assistant Eva Maria Sternkopf Lillebæk helped with tips and tricks to Western Blot and provided us with a Bacillus subtilis strain.
Ph.D. fellow Sabrina Brøner helped us getting doxycycline.
Post doc Anders Boysen assisted us with planning of Western Blots collaborated with materials to make them.
Medical Laboratory Technician Simon Rose introduced us to lab safety and behavior. Furthermore, he agreed to give an interview regarding our safety form.
From the University of Copenhagen professor, Ph.D., head of Section for Molecular Plant Biology, vice head of Copenhagen Plant science Centre Poul Erik Jensen who sent us a Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 strain.
Stud.Bsc.Sc. Kristian Davidsen from DTU provided us with USER polymerase.
Professor, Ph.D. Nils Joakim Færgeman pointed us to litterature to design a GC experiment and the toxicity assay on Caenorhabditis elegans.
Ph. D. fellow Eva Bang Harvald provided us with Caenorhabditis elegans and practical information about what to do with them.
Professor Dr. rer. nat. habil. Olaf-Georg Issinger provided us materials and facilities to do SDS-PAGE analysis.
Ph.D. fellow from University of Copenhagen Nana Cecilie Halmsted Kongsholm guided us while planning our ethics section.
Postdoctoral fellow at the Medical Research Council Julius Fredens provided us with a plasmid containing FAT-2 originating from Caenorhabditis elegans.
The SDU iGEM team 2013 has provided great inspiration for the making of our wiki.
Events support
We would like to thank everyone who has helped us promote our project and iGEM by helping us arrange our events.
Student house Odense arranged an event where we could talk about iGEM and synthetic biology and hold a quiz night.
Syddanske studerende let us promote our own project and iGEM by having us at the study trade fair.
IMCC (International Medical Cooperation Committee) let us promote our own project and iGEM by having us at the study trade fair and at sundhedsmekka.
The former SDU iGEM members who met with us and heard about our project and thoughts.
General support
We have received a lot of help during our project - also help that was not in the lab or specific for the  execution of our project. We would like thank all the people that have helped us one way or another.
DTU (Technical University of Denmark) had arranged a crash course in the lab for Danish iGEM teams and introduced us to primers, USER cloning and the design of the team wiki.
KU (University of Copenhagen) arranged an ethics workshop for Danish iGEM teams.
YSB (young synthetic biologist) arranged and held the UK iGEM meet-up and allowed our team to join the meet up and told us more about synthetic biology and had arranged different workshops.
Everyone all over the world, who has answered our questionnaire about GMO and what they think about it being a food resource.
Jane Fornitz from the company Ibsing & Fornitz ApS introduced us to the different types of personalities and how to work together with different personalities - this has been a great help for  the team work.
Doctor Yaa Difie-Osei from the National Biosafety Committee, Ghana and Professor George Armah from the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research gave us an interview to our Practices and Policy, regarding outreach and ethical considerations.
Bioscientific dissemination at SDU gave us great feedback on our presentation in preparation of the jamboree.
Stud. bac linguistics Klara Tandrup Pedersen helped us proofread our wiki.
Technical support
Post doc Ann Zahle Andersen helped us decode the programs used for modelling.
Stud.cand. Patrick Rosendahl Andreassen, stud.cand. Andreas Kjær and stud.cand. Thøger Jensen Krogh have assisted us with sequencing results.
Stud.cand. Thøger Jensen Krogh introduced us to designing our team wiki.
Modelling
Stud.cand. Nicky Cordua Mattsson adviced us with the modelling of our system.
Post doc Ann Zahle Andersen adviced us all the way with our model.
All though we have recieved a lot of support, the hard work has been don by ourselves - to see a list of how the main responsibilities has been divided click here.
