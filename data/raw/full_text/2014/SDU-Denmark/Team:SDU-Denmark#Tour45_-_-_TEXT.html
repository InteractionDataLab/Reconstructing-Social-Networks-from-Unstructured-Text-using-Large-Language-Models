Submitted parts
Below is a list of the parts we submitted to the parts registry. To see sequencing, characterization etc. click the part names to go to the parts registry page.
Basic parts
BBa_K1475001
OneProt: The coding region of our self-designed nutritional protein. OneProt contains the recommended ratio of all the indispensible amino acids to a human  diet. The protein is also compliant with the recommended ratio of indispensible  to dispensable amino acids.
BBa_K1475002
fat-2: This part contains only the coding region of the fat-2 desaturase from Caenorhabditis elegans, the natural gene consists of three exons.
BBa_K1475003
TetR(N): the frequently used tet repressor from Escherichia coli ( Part:BBa_C0040 ) modified by removing the LVA rapid degradation tag.
Regulatory devices
BBa_K1475004
Pcons-TetR(N)-term: the tet repressor from Escherichia coli is expressed form a constitutively active promoter. A terminator prevents transcription of  genes downstream of the repressor.
BBa_K1475008
Pcon-LacI-term: Lac repressor protein derived from Escherichia coli without LVA degradation tag, controlled by a constitutively active promoter.
Constitutively active production devices
BBa_K1475000
p(tetR)-OneProt-term: OneProt is a self-designed protein designed to meet the recommended ratio of indispensible amino acids to a human diet according to  the world health organization (WHO). It also contains the recommended ratio  of indispensible to dispensible amino acids.
Regulable production devices
BBa_K1475005
Pcon-TetR(N)-term-p(TetR)-GFP-term: GFP controlled by a TetR, pTet expression system. The Tet repressor protein binds to the Tet promoter, the tet  repressor protein is inhibited by aTc hereby inducing the expression of GFP.
BBa_K1475006
Pcon-TetR(LVA)-term-p(TetR)-GFP-term: GFP controlled by a TetR+LVA pTet expression system. The Tet repressor protein binds to the Tet promoter, the tet  repressor protein is inhibited by aTc hereby inducing the expression of GFP.
BBa_K1475007
Pcon-LacI-term-p(LacI)-GFP-term: GFP controlled by the lac repressor and lac promoter system.
BBa_K1475012
Pcon-LacI-p(LacI)-GFP-term: GFP controlled by a LacI, p(LacI) system in which the LacI and p(Lac) sequence overlaps.

Want more? Go to iGEM.org!
If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads   on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe   join a team yourself?
A tour for everyone
Click here to begin the interactive wiki-tour
Take a quick glance at our project or dig deeper to get a complete walkthrough of   the wiki. Or do something in-between, the choice is yours.
