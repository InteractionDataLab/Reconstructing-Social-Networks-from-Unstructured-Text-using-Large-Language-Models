Eat Coli
Click to visit Mamma’s Burgers!
People tend to fear bacteria and oppose genetic modification, and thus synthetic biology. Our attempt at a novel outreach approach will teach the audience facts about bacteria, DNA and GMO in a fun and participatory way.
At the burger joint, Mamma's Burgers, crazy things might happen but it sure will be educational!
The Untapped Food Resource of the Century
Edible coli is a proposal for a sustainable food source.
A modified strain of the bacteria Escherichia coli will provide the optimal quantities of nutrition a human needs, by degrading otherwise non-degradable material for the human body.
First step is the production of a nutritional protein, the OneProt, and the biosynthesis of essential fatty acids – additionally, it will carry the appealing touch of lemon flavor. Then the Nutrition Generator, a custom designed, innovative and revolutionary cultivation tank will ensure an on-going amplification of the Edible coli products, easy to handle and drain from.
Could the world live off of microorganisms?
