Nutrition Generator can solve problems with undernourishment and in addition be used all over the world 
as a supplement for malnourished people, vegans and vegetarians by supplying the right amounts of essential and 
nonessential amino acids, as well as essential Ï3 and Ï6 fatty acids.</P><H4>The product idea</H4><P><A class="popupImg alignRight" style="width:300px" target="_blank" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/9/9e/2014SDUbusinessplan1.jpg" title="Figure 1: Schematic drawing of the tank.">
Figure 1: Schematic drawing of the tank.
</A><SPAN class="intro">The Nutrition Generator is constructed of</SPAN> two tanks, one bacteria tank and one cellulose tank. The two tanks are connected with a bacterial flow tube, and a bacteria reflow tube with a pump helping the flow. The tubes are equipped with a safety closure system, so that bacteria can only be transferred when 
needed, and contamination risk is minimized.<SPAN class="intro">The bacteria tank contains Edible coli,</SPAN> a gene modified bacteria that expresses huge amounts of proteins
and fatty acids by using cellulose as a carbon source. It is not possible to open the bacteria tank, which avoids 
contamination by other bacteria or fungi. The tank is designed to contain Edible coli from the beginning, 
which will reproduce, so that it is not required to change or add new bacteria at any time. Furthermore the 
tank will contain a pH indicator and a thermometer, so it's easy to keep an eye on and maintain the 
optimal growth conditions of the bacteria.<SPAN class="intro">The cellulose tank is much larger</SPAN> than the bacteria tank. It has a lid in the top, where cellulose containing
materials, e.g. plant material, can be added, and through which the tank can be cleaned. In the 
bottom of the tank there is a tap where the final product can be tapped.<SPAN class="intro">The cellulose tank functions as</SPAN> an autoclave when closed and heated. For this purpose the tank has a valve, with
which the pressure can be regulated.<A class="popupImg alignRight" style="width:300px" target="_blank" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/7/77/2014SDUbusinessplan2.png" title="Figure 2: Process diagram of Nutrition Generator.">
Figure 2: Process diagram of Nutrition Generator.
</A><SPAN class="intro">To start the expression</SPAN> of proteins and fatty acids by Edible coli, a small amount of the bacteria is
transferred from the bacteria tank to the cellulose tank. Then cellulose is added into the cellulose tank 
through the lid. The bacteria will now begin to degrade cellulose and express Ï3 and Ï6 fatty-acid and 
OneProt, a protein that contains all the essential amino acids in the right ratio, as well as all the 
nonessential amino acids. After a while the bacteria is autoclaved, so the end product does not contain 
any living bacteria.<SPAN class="intro">Before the final product</SPAN> can be tapped, a small amount must be pumped through the bacteria reflow tube 
into the bacteria tank. The final product functions as media for the living bacteria in the bacteria tank. 
Now the final product can be tapped and enjoyed. 
The Nutrition Generator is available as both electric and non-electric version, for which the non-electric version 
requires heat energy from e.g. a campfire. Specialized staff is only needed when the product is set up. 
Afterwards the use of the product is very simple and even children can operate the tank. The wear and tear 
that might appear after long term use can be fixed with simple handyman skills.</P><H4>Edible coli - The core product</H4><P><SPAN class="intro">Edible coli is a non-pathogenic <I>Escherichia coli</I></SPAN> bacteria that is genetically modified. The bacteria is
designed with a plasmid, containing the genes for OneProt and Ï3 and Ï6 fatty acid biosynthesis. The 
promoters are activated in the presence of cellulose. 
OneProt is a protein that includes all the essential and non essential amino acids in the right ratio 
recommended by WHO (World Health Organization). 
For those wanting Edible coli with taste, the bacteria is also available with a high expressed lemon flavor 
gene.</P><H4>Safety</H4><P><SPAN class="intro">The Nutrition Generator is a safe</SPAN> and closed system and without any risk of bacterial infection. 
When Edible coli is transferred from the bacteria tank into the cellulose tank, the lid and tap are closed. 
Furthermore, before the end product is tapped from the tank, the entire contents of the cellulose tank is 
autoclaved, a process that kill bacteria and other micro-organisms. In that way, no living bacteria will ever 
escape out of the tank.</P><H4>Customer base - who is supposed to buy the product</H4><P><SPAN class="intro">Charitable organizations are the main customers</SPAN><SPAN class="intro">The Nutrition Generator is,</SPAN> however, not only useful for undernourished poor people; all people in the world
can benefit from the protein and fat rich product of the tank, and therefore also private consumers, public 
institutions and many more can be customers.</P><H4>Key partners - with whom do we work</H4><P><SPAN class="intro">Our main key partners</SPAN> will be charity organizations, as these have a close connection to trouble spots in
developing countries, as well as a good contact to supplier and social helpers. 
In addition we will work together with engineers, who can help us design and develop the product. 
At least specialized councils can help us solve ethical issues that might emerge.</P><H4>Consumer - who is supposed to use the product</H4><P><SPAN class="intro">All people in the entire world</SPAN> are possible consumers of the Nutrition Generator, but as long as people have
access to other food sources, we donât expect that they will consume GMO produced food. 
The target group is undernourished people in developing countries who donât have the money and access 
to protein and fat rich food. But also vegans and vegetarians can benefit from this product, as it is a very 
good alternative protein and fat source, for those who don't eat animal products.</P><H4>Demography - where shall our product be used</H4><P><SPAN class="intro">The target place is</SPAN> where people suffer from undernourishment. As mentioned above Africa, South-East
Asia and Latin America are examples of such areas, where many inhabitants are poor and undernourished. 
The Nutrition Generator may with advantage also be used in crisis areas, e.g. war zones or areas 
affected by natural disasters. 
Furthermore, the product is also a great food source for private homes in high-income countries, where 
people can use the food product as a supplement to the diet.</P><H4>Transport - how will our product reach the consumer</H4><P><SPAN class="intro">To meet the main objective</SPAN> of the Nutrition Generator, to provide a food source for poor and undernourished
people in low-income countries, we need the help of charitable organizations that deliver and set up our 
product. Charities often send food and other items to developing countries, and as they know how to do so, 
they are our perfect partners in this field. 
Along with the product, there must also be a facilitator present, who can set up the product, and instruct 
consumers to the use and application of the product.</P><H4>Funding - who will pay production and costs?</H4><P><SPAN class="intro">The production of the</SPAN> first Nutrition Generators needs funding by donation, as the target consumers are 
not able to pay for the product. We expect that the product will be a great success so that, after a while, 
also well-nourished people, who have access to many different food sources, will buy the product and thus 
contribute to the production costs.</P><H4>Competitors</H4><P><SPAN class="intro">The Nutrition Generator is the first</SPAN> product of its kind and there are no similar products, but products within the same category exist. The international marked offers a wide variety of protein powders that provide 
the consumer with many nutritional proteins. They are great products, but we donât see any potential for this to 
be a food source for undernourished poor people. Protein powders are produced synthetically and must be 
available in big amounts to cover the daily needs and a new quantity must be delivered very often. It is impossible to deliver protein powder to all undernourished people 
in the world, as there a too many (805 millions in  
<SPAN class="sourceReference">2012-2014</SPAN><SPAN class="tooltip"><SPAN class="tooltipHeader">Source:</SPAN>
    (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2014: Hunger Statistics.
<A href="http://www.fao.org/hunger/en/" target="_blank">(Link)</A></SPAN>), and it would be very expensive. 
Furthermore, protein powder needs to be dissolved in a liquid media, which is often insufficient for poor 
people.
Our OneProt protein, which is produced in the Nutrition Generator, is produced by bacteria that can 
reproduce themselves. A Nutrition Generator only need to be delivered once and will afterwards produce 
protein and fat rich food, by cheap and easy accessible materials.</P><H4>Marketing - our promises to the costumer</H4><P><SPAN class="intro">The Nutrition Generator can supply</SPAN> the consumer with proteins and fats, food sources that all people  need. Everyone can be a consumer of the product, and it is usable with and without electricity, which 
gives the product multiple applications. 
We promise our customers a sustainable product that has a very low cost of operation by the use of 
materials that are non-degradable by humans and available all over the world. 
Furthermore the use is safe, as no living bacteria will ever escape from the tank, and as the media is 
autoclaved before the product is eaten. 
We see a great potential for the Nutrition Generator, an easy usable and cheap product that can save many 
lives.
