Dr. Yaa Difie-Osie from the National Biosafety Committee, Ghana.
</A><SPAN class="intro">Senior Lecturer in Biochemistry,</SPAN> Dr. Yaa Difie-Osei (Dr. Yaa), agreed to meet with our team member Anne, 
during her stay in the capital of Ghana, Accra, in August. The purpose was to talk about GMOs in relation 
to our Edible coli. The interview was held at the Department of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology 
at the University of Ghana in Legon. Dr. Yaa has previously worked at the university herself but is now retired 
from her position as lecturer. Dr. Yaa is still involved in 
the development of synthetic biology in Ghana as a member of the National Biosafety Committee of Ghana. 
The fact that Dr. Yaa has much experience regarding synthetic biology and at the same time is a member of 
the National Biosafety Committee makes her expertise significant to our project.<SPAN class="intro">When Dr. Yaa heard about</SPAN> our iGEM project she expressed great interest and there was a clear 
understanding and acknowledgement of the concepts of iGEM. Dr. Yaa spoke very passionately of 
GMOs and made it clear that GMOs would be a considerable solution to malnutrition, which is a recurring 
motif in Ghana. As a member of the Safety Committee, Dr. Yaa had recently contributed to the approval of 
four GMO projects in Ghana. The four GMO projects include protein rich sweet potato and cotton with 
pesticides integrated into the genom (BT-cotton). The projects have got permits to do research but the research 
will be subject to strict rules concerning biosafety, management of risks in biochemistry and national

By introducing GMOs this issue could potentially be reduced. However, the ethical aspects of introducing 
GMOs as relief-aid for hunger or malnutrition must be subject to consideration, according to Dr. 
Yaa. Personally, Dr. Yaa did not think of GMO as unethical if the purpose was relief of hunger or 
malnutrition. However, it would be necessary to educate the population so that they would have a foundation for decisions regarding the use of GMOs as a nutrition source.
Dr. Yaa mentioned the importance of considering indications producing genetically modified
organism. The hypothetical GMO should have relevance in a way that promises improvement of lifestyle or 
brings good quality to something.
Furthermore, it would be necessary to demonstrate the safety of the GMO. This would include risk 
assessments such as inspection of the organism when separated from its natural surroundings. It would 
additionally be crucial that the commercial releases were informative so that the consumers would receive 
the essential information.<SPAN class="intro">According to Dr Yaa</SPAN> the objections to GMOs seen from a religious point of view could be a problem in the
beginning but it would not persist. Consequently, development of GMOs would entail that the genes, which 
were used to modify the organisms, should be picked with concern. For instance, genes from a pig would 
cause a revolt coming from the religious community.</P><H4>Interview with Prof. George Armah</H4><P><A class="popupImg alignRight" style="width:320px" target="_blank" href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/5/50/2014SDUghana2.PNG" title="Professor George Armah (on the left) from the Noguchi memorial institute for medical research and Anne Katrine Kurtzhals (on the right) from our iGEM team.">
Professor George Armah (on the left) from the Noguchi memorial institute for medical research and Anne Katrine Kurtzhals (on the right) from our iGEM team.
</A><SPAN class="intro">Professor George Armah</SPAN> (Prof. Armah) was head of the Electron Microscopy &amp; Histopathology department 
at the Nuguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana, Legon. Currently Prof. Armah 
is the Master of Commonwealth Hall, University of Ghana, Legon.
Prof. Armah has a lot of expert knowledge about the health profile of the Ghanaians as well as the condition 
of life in Ghana. For this reason, Prof. Armah was an interesting scientist to interview in connection with 
applications of Edible coli in malnourished countries.<SPAN class="intro">Prof. Armah said that</SPAN> he believe that the Edible coli could have potential in Ghana. The main issue would be to
introduce the product as a new source of nutrition. According to Prof. Armah it would be crucial to include
the Edible coli in the Ghanaian gastronomy. He sees it as unlikely that people will change their way of life. Therefore, GMOs should be incorporated into food such as sweet potato, rice etc.<SPAN class="intro">Prof. Armah spoke of</SPAN> two important aspects of malnutrition in Ghana:
<UL><LI>The spoilage of food was mentioned as an issue. In Ghana the access to food is not a
problem. However, malnourishment is a persistent dilemma throughout the county. Depending on the geographical location, the people eat 
differently. In the southern part of Ghana, the population primarily eat fish and fufu. Fufu is a 
staple food made from the cassava plant and this is rich on carbohydrates. The population in the 
northern part of Ghana has lots of vegetables and chicken, and therefore they do not get the 
recommended ratio of Ï fatty acids.</LI><LI>The second issue Prof. Armah spoke of was the traditional and cultural practices of Ghana. As mentioned,
there are regional differences of food supply. Furthermore, human beings do not
necessarily prioritize out of common sense but rather act in accordance with tradition and delight.</LI></UL><SPAN class="intro">Prof. Armah illustrated his points with</SPAN> the two aspects by giving examples from the northern part of Ghana. Traditionally children are forbidden to eat eggs, which is a contradiction to the fact that children particularly need good nutrition to encourage their 

<SPAN class="sourceReference"> growth.</SPAN><SPAN class="tooltip"><SPAN class="tooltipHeader">Source:</SPAN>

This tradition was based on a general attitude about children becoming impertinent when they were given
nutrient-rich food. Another example from the northern part of Ghana was that most men would rather sell a chicken instead
of eating it with the intention of buying alcohol. <SPAN class="intro">Prof. Armah refered to the problems</SPAN> considering malnourishment as localized. Cultural and educational
practices where mentioned as issues in relation to the application of GMOs. According to Prof. Armah the 
rural areas of Ghana did not take interest in synthetic biology due to the lack of education.
Objections to the use of synthetic biology were not linked to religion or culture according 
to Prof. Armah. Thereby GMOs might not be rejected based on religious and social reasons, but on the fact that the population might not embrace a foreign initiative.</P><DIV class="imageGallery alignCenter">
