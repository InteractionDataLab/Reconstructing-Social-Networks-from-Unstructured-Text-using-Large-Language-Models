SOPs
We used a lot of different Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) during our project written by last years SDU iGEM team. It is very important that every person in the lab uses the same SOP to make sure that the experiments does not depend on the person executing them, but only on the methods used. Any changes made to the SOPs were agreed upon by the entire team, to make sure that everyone knew when and why a Standard Operating Procedure was changed. Below you can explore all our SOPs:
iGEM2013 SOP0001 v01 - ON culture of E. coli
iGEM2013 SOP0002 v01 - Table autoclave

Want more? Go to iGEM.org!
If you want to learn more about Synthetic Biology you should visit iGEM's homepage, which contains loads   on the subject. You can even visit other teams' wikis and take a look at what they accomplished. Or maybe   join a team yourself?
