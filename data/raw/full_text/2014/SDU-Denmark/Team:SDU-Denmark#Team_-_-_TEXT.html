Team Description
We are a very ambitious group of 10 students from five different disciplines: medicine, biomedicine, biochemistry and molecular biology, mathematics and chemical engineering. Because  we didn’t know each other before the team was formed, we expect to evolve as a group and learn to  use our differences -both professionally and personally- to achieve a synergic teamwork. We have  big expectations for the team, the competition and ourselves. We are prepared to use our holidays  (and the only sunny months in Denmark) to work hard on a meaningful project that will, hopefully,  be of use for someone. We want to do this in order to get more practical experience and have a good  time with other engaged students. Some of us have never been in the lab before, and other feel that  the scheduled lab-exercises in our studies are just too predictable. At this point, we wish to design a project that will span the subjects of synthetic biology, characterization, mathematical modelling and simulation of a biological system as well as a broader outreach to general public.
