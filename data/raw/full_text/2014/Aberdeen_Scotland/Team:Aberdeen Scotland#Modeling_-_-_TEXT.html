Introduction
Quorum Sensing
GFP Response
Assay Sensitivity
Modelling Aims
Purpose
In order to verify and characterize our diagnostic system we created mathematical models for each individual component. Modeling and simulations were essential      techniques that guided our approach from design to completion. As the main point of interest in our system was inter-cellular communication and its optimization, we      employed ODEs and PDEs as our main mathematical tools.
Quorum Sensing
We developed a spacial model for analyzing Quorum Sensing between cells and then studied it under our system desired conditions. This gave us insight into how      best structure our assay.
GFP Response
By simulating GFP response we made sure our system will react in a predictable manner and in an appropriate amount of time. We ensured that simulations agreed with      data so that we can rely on reproducibility.
Assay Sensitivity
As with any other test, sensitivity is a main factor. The test needed to be sensitive enough to detect HAT, but also tolerant to noise, so that false-positives      were minimized. We explored the process of antibody binding to make sure we meet those criteria.
