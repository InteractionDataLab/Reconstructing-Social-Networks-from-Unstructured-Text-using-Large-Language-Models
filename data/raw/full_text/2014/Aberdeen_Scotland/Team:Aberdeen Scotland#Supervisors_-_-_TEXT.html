We would like to thank our beloved supervisors who helped us on this journey and who made all of this possible.
Dr Susan Black
Recent Research
Structural and physiological study of the evolution of outer membrane porin mediated antibiotic resistance of E.coli strains during prolonged antibiotic therapy. Molecular dissection of the mechanisms by which proteins are able to transduce mechanical force applied to biological membranes into a physiological response. E. coli contains several examples of such mechanosensitive ion channels. By identifying the similarities and differences between these mechanosensitive channel proteins, a picture can be built of the requirements for mechanosensation, a universal and basic component of the sensory interface between the cell and the environment.
Dr Rey Carabeo
Ph.D., Oncology, University of Wisconsin-Madison
B.S., Microbiology & Molecular Genetics, UCLA
Research interests:
Cell biology of Chlamydia pathogenesis:
-  Signal transduction and actin dynamics during Chlamydia invasion
-  Modulation of host cell focal adhesions by Chlamydia
- Biological and computational modelling of early events in Chlamydia infection
Dr Alessandro Moura
Lecturer in Physics. Dr de Moura holds a PhD in Physics from Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Brazil.
Dr Moura has a background in dynamical systems and statistical physics. His research interests in these areas include transient chaos, nonhyperbolic chaotic scattering, and chaotic advection of flows. Since moving to Aberdeen, he has been applying physics and mathematics to understand fundamental biological processes, in collaborations with biologists in Aberdeen and elsewhere. Biological problems he is actively working on include: mathematical modelling of DNA replication, dynamics and regulation of protein synthesis in uni-cellular organisms, modelling the responses of pathogenic fungi species to combinations of stresses, homeostasis of bacteria, macromolecular dynamics in cellular membranes.
Dr Berndt Müller
Research Interests
The lab has a long-standing interest in the control of gene expression at the level of mRNA.  This started in 1993, when Berndt joined the University of Bern where he worked with Prof Daniel Schümperli.  Prior to that he did his PhD in the group of Prof Theo Koller at the Institute of Cell Biology of the ETH in Zürich, with Dr Andrzej Stasiak and Dr Elisabeth DiCapua, analysing the interaction of the recombination protein RecA rotein with DNA.  He then spent 5 years in the lab of Dr Steve West at Cancer Research UK studying the Biochemistry of Genetic Recombination. At Bern University, he identified factors that control the processing of histone RNA to mature mRNA.  This work was continued at the University of Aberdeen and has led to insight into the molecular function of these factors.
Dr Stefania Spanò
Research Interests
Salmonella Typhi is an exclusive human pathogen and the cause of typhoid fever, a life-threatening systemic disease that affects millions of people and kills more than 200,000 every year. The goal of my research is to gain insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Salmonella Typhi pathogenesis and its human-adaptation. We are using an advanced cell biological approach, where imaging and biochemical analyses are integrated by genetic, genomic and proteomic methods. These studies also intend to address fundamental questions in the cell biology of the host. One main question that we are focusing on is about the host mechanisms restricting S. Typhi from infecting non-susceptible hosts.
Prof Ian Stansfield
Biography
Ian Stansfield graduated from the University of Sheffield with a BSc (Hons) Microbiology in 1986. Post-graduate studies, on the subject of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were carried out under the supervision of Prof. Steve Kelly at the University of Sheffield. This work led to the award of a PhD in 1990. His post-doctoral research was carried out with Professor Mick Tuite at the University of Kent from 1990 to 1996. This work focused on studies of protein synthesis in yeast, investigating how the accuracy of protein synthesis is maintained, and the mechanism of translation termination. In 1996, he was appointed a Lecturer at the University of Aberdeen, was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2003, Reader in 2009, and Personal Chair in 2011. He is currently coordinator of the Systems Biology Integrative Centre within the Institute of Medical Sciences.
Dr Samantha Miller
Research Interests
I am currently a lecturer in the School of Medical Sciences.  My research career is focussed on structure and function relationships in two sets of ion channels in Escherichia coli involved in bacterial survival of changes in their environments.  My group is currently funded by a Wellcome Trust Programme Grant, in collaboration with Prof. Ian Booth and Dr T. Rasmussen (Aberdeen), Prof. Jim Naismith, (St. Andrews) and Dr S. Conway (Oxford), a BBSRC Research Grant with Prof. Jim Naismith, (St. Andrews) and a Marie Curie ITN Grant.
