Project Timeline
Responsibilities and activities during the course of the project over the summer.
Winning Project Idea
E. coli quorum sensing based system for detecting co-localized disease markers for Trypanosomiasis Diagnostic Set
Our lab activities were split into four major streams focusing on:
Ag43
INP
Quorum sensing
Detector device construction and mathematical modelling

Meeting with a specialist in the field of antibodies to discuss out project idea
Identification of relevant parts of the biological system for modelling
Preliminary modelling decisions (modelling software, approach, etc)
Week 2 30/6-6/7
Trial PCR
E. Coli growth curve assemby
Further characterization and write-up of three BioBricks we found not to be compatible with RFC10 assembly standard (Bba_K759001, Bba_K542009,         Bba_K346007)
Primer design for multiple site-directed mutagenesis to remove 6 additional PstI sites present in Bba_K759001

Transformations of plasmids of all rescued BioBricks into competent cells (XL-1 Blue); plating
Preparation of application to WHO, in order to request blood and serum samples from HAT sufferers at different stages of disease -> could not work         with samples due to Health and Safety concerns :(
Friday lab meeting to discuss project progress and evaluate aims of the project
Started work on spatial model of Quorum Sensing in order to decide on most appropriate cell-to-cell communication design
Week 3 7/7-13/7
Site-directed mutagenesis; two experimental conditions: with 3 pairs of primers and all 6 pairs of primers (PCR, DpnI digest, transformations into         XL-1 Blue competent cells, plating, choosing clones for further analysis (24), overnight cultures, plasmid mini-preps, restriction digest with PstI; data         analysis)
Further analysis of clones with XbaI+SpeI digest
Selection of two candidates with the least number of PstI sites remaining for the second round of SDM
iGEM track specification
Friday lab meeting to discuss project progress and evaluate aims of the project
Preliminary results of Quorum Sensing model in 2D (bad news for original design)
Started work on initial web design for Wiki
Week 4 14/7-20/7
Sending selected candidates from SDM no.1 for sequencing
SDM attempt no.2 with appropriate primers to remove remaining PstI sites from selected candidates (PCR, DpnI digest, transformations into XL-1 Blue         competent cells, plating -> no colonies :()
Re-transformations -> no success :(
group pictures taken for promotional materials
Friday lab meeting to discuss project progress and evaluate aims of the project
Further analysis of Quorum Sensing by 3D modelling (initial QS design needs to be adjusted)
Restructured Wiki design for optimization
Week 5 21/7-27/7
Investigation into artificial gene synthesis in order to replace part of the gene with remaining PstI sites
Repetition of SDM no.2 with increased template concentration and a temperature gradient; DMSO added to one condition
DpnI digest, transformations into XL-1 Blue competent cells, plating, choosing clones for further analysis (50!), overnight cultures, plasmid mini-         preps, restriction digest with PstI; data analysis)
Potential candidates with all additional PstI sites removed were selected for full restriction digest panel
Optimization of gel electrophoresis to achieve desired resolution
Graphic design of the project overview figure
Friday lab meeting to discuss project progress and evaluate aims of the project
Multi-cellular simulations of Quorum Sensing confirming the correction and improvement of cell-to-cell communication design
Started work on GFP production model
More work on Wiki design
Week 6 28/7-3/8
Restriction digest with unique cutters to investigate band pattern in order to detect whether significant insertions or deletions took place
Sending two potential candidates lacking all undesired PstI cut sites off for sequencing
In-fusion to insert FLAG flanked by multiple cloning sites into Ag43 PstI-free candidate; simultaneous insertion into ampicillin and chloromphenicol         backbones (gradient PCR, DpnI digest, gel electrophoresis, restriction digest of backbones+RFP constructs and gel extraction, PCR clean-up,         electrophoresis, in-fusion, transformation, plating, overnight cultures, candidate selection)
