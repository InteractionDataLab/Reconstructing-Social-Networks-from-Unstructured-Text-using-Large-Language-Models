Two 17 amino acids long beta hairpins were removed from Ag43 in order to eliminate native aggregation properties. We describe the design and construction of the new Biobrick, and its verification using restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. We show that removal of β-hairpins removes auto-aggregation capability of Ag43, creating a useful reagent that can be used for E. coli surface display. </P><H3>1.       Structure and function</H3><P> Antigen 43 (sometimes called Ag43 or fluffing protein) is a phase-variable outer membrane protein encoded by flu gene. It is native to E.coli K12 strain and is usually expressed at about 50, 000 copies/cell. Ag34 precursor is 1039 amino acids long and subsequently becomes cleaved into alpha and beta chains (499 and 488 amino acids long respectively). The beta subunit forms a β-barrel pore via which alpha-subunit translocates to the cell surface, and with which it remains non-covalently joined. The surface alpha chain can be released by a brief heat treatment at approx. 60oC. Ag43 is an autotransporter protein, therefore it possesses all information necessary for translocation to the cell surface in its coding sequence. Ag43 mediates autoaggregation, via a velcro-like mechanism (Heras et. al., 2014), and plays a role in E.coli biofilm formation. Interestingly, the alpha subunit is able to express foreign peptide sequences on E.coli cell surface if inserted just in front of codon 148 (Kjærgaard et. al., 2002).</P><CENTER><FONT size="2">Fig.1    Graphic representation of Ag43 autotransporter structure and process of autotransportation.

Rationale for beta-hairpins removal </H3><P> The shape of α-subunit of Ag43 resembles letter L (Fig.2). It consists of a 'β-helix domain [which forms] the stem of the letter L, followed by three rungs flanked by four β-hairpin motifs that bend the protein by about 110° and a C-terminal (...) parallel β-helix domain [which forms] the bottom of the letter L' (Heras et. al., 2014). It has been indicated that this unique shape plays a crucial role in cell-to-cell aggregation via velcro-like mechanism, in which α-subunits form a dimer by coling around each other. This interaction is strengthened by Van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges facilitated by the L-shape (Heras et. al., 2014). Recent research demonstrates that disruption of the bend and straightening of the shape by removal of two β-hairpin sequences eliminates self-association of Ag43 proteins (Heras et. al., 2014). Removal of β-hairpins does not interfere with protein translocation to the cell surface membrane.<CENTER>

It is composed of an Ag43 coding sequence with an in-frame FLAG epitope tag flanked by BglII and HindIII multiple cloning sites inserted within the alpha-subunit in front of codon 148 of Ag43. Two β-hairpin forming sequences were removed from the Ag43 coding sequence, maintaining ORF. Expression of Ag43 is under the control of the pBAD promoter; it includes a ribosome binding site as well as two transcriptional terminators.
Structure of the BioBrick was designed to allow easy insertion of foreign protein sequences of choice at codon 148 with a simple restriction digest with BglII and HindIII followed by ligation in cases where aggregation is undesirable.
Potential uses of  this BioBrick include surface display of foreign peptide sequences and synthetic vaccines production.</P><H3>4.       Template for foreign peptide insertion</H3> 
Depending on the length, desired foreign peptide sequence can be purchased as oligos or a synthetic piece of DNA. In order to keep the foreign protein sequence in-frame, a following template should be used:


5' <I>gct gtg</I><B>AGA TCT </B>(your sequence) <B><U>AAG CTT</U></B><I>aac acc</I> 3' [mote reading frame of Ag43 is indicated by nucleotide triplets]
<B>BglII recognition site</B>; <B><U>HindIII recognition site</U></B>; <I>sequence adjacent to foreign peptide insertion site</I><H3>5.       Making of the Biobrick and plasmid modularization</H3> 

Bba_K1352001 BioBrick (Ag43+FLAG+MCS) was a starting material for this construct. Two β-hairpins were removed via In-Fusion reaction (Clonetech). For more information regarding the construction of this BioBrick please see: https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aberdeen_Scotland/Parts

Since it contains β-hairpin sequences, two prominent bands corresponding to 2.5 kb and 4.1 kb are present confirming presence of one XbaI and one KpnI cut sites.

In addition, a range of single and double restriction digests was carried out in order to ensure that no major indels occurred in the process of In-Fusion and created BioBrick behaves as expected and yields desired band pattern.</P><CENTER><FONT size="2">Fig.6    Diagnostic restriction digest panel.

</FONT></CENTER><P>A clear difference is visible between aggregation levels of tested BioBricks. Ag43 clearly aggregates when induced with arabinose. Suprisingly, Ag43+FLAG+MCS does not display aggregation properties, even though it possesses β-hairpin sequences. We hypothesize that insertion of foreign peptide sequences, in this case FLAG tag epitope, slightly changes the shape of Ag43 at places critical for clumping and disrupts velcro-like mechanism of aggregation. Ag43+FLAG+MCS(-)β-hairpins also does not display any aggregation properties. Although we cannot confirm that this is due to removal of β-hairpin sequences and not presence of a FLAG tag epitope sequence due to lack of Ag43(-)FLAG(-)β-hairpins, literature evidence provided evidence that the lack of aggregation properties is due to removal of β-hairpins and would persist if FLAG+MCS were removed (Heras et. al., 2014).</P><P>Since the lack of aggregation properties in Bba_K1352001 may be foreign peptide sequence specific, created BioBrick Bba_K1352002 which lacks β-hairpins is still a useful construct which can be utilized in a range of projects where aggregation is undesirable. </P><P>Note: Further characterization is needed in order to determine whether removal of β-hairpin sequences does not interfere with foreign peptides expression on cell surface membrane.</P><H3>References</H3>
