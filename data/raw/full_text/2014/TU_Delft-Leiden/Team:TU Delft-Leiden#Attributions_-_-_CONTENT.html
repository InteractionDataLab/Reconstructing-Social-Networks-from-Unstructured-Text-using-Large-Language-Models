Has been setting-up the team, has created the timeline and had on overview on the main deadlines, established the communication channels for the team,  has facilitated the general meetings (more than 60 in total), ensured the communication flow between the team members, advisors and other related stakeholders and supervised the overall activity of the team. In addition, she was organizing the mid-term presentations of our project, took care of all the practicalities in participating in DIG-it event and other related iGEM  related events. 
She was a key member in the fundraising process (by contributing to the content of our booklet, contacted companies, departments and other organizations), and was actively involved in the Policy&amp; Practice department.
Next, she provided support in writing the safety report, coding wiki page and helped other departments (ie. measuring set-up for the curli resistance) and performed small lab tasks. </P><P><B>Anne</B> - Science Manager
Literature study on Electron Transport, Conductive Curli and Landmine Detection to make a general experimental set-up.  Develop cloning strategies including primer design for the Electron Transport, Conductive Curli and Landmine Detection modules.  Cloning of BioBricks, including the Golden Gate Assembly for the BioBricks in the Electron Transport and Conductive Curli modules.  Characterization of the Electron Transport BioBricks. 
 </P><P><B> Anton </B> - Modeling Manager 
My responsibilities were managing the modeling efforts of our team together with Mathijs. I did a lot of modeling myself as well, mainly FBA and Graph Theory. Also, I helped with fundraising and coding of our wiki. Besides that, I actively participated in a lot of discussions and actively co-operated with the life science department. Lastly, I edited a lot of texts and implemented them on the wiki. 
</P><P><B> Cristy </B> - Lab Manager 
My personal contribution in the beginning of the project was reading articles and help with the implementation of ideas. During the project, I was also concerned with the understanding of the experimental processes and experimental setup. In the lab, I was mainly focused on the ET module. For this module and partly for the other modules, I did a lot of cloning and transformations. I was also involved in the characterization of the ET module and the implementation of these results.  As a lab manager, one activity is taking care of the organization in the lab, so that everyone could work efficiently. Another activity was organizing labmeetings for the people who worked in the lab, to keep each other updated about the labwork. I also wrote a lot of protocols and wrote about the ET module for the wiki page. Outside the science and lab part, I also was involved in the fundraising process by contacting companies and organizations. 
</P><P><B>Debu</B> - Social Manager 
Initially I was involved with the modeling work and then during the summer my focus shifted towards designing the hardware and software for the potentiostat. With the help of Sim the potentiostat became a physical reality due to his extraordinary dexterity in recognizing /dealing with practical electronic hardware components .I assisted Sim with the design of the Drop Sens Micro-fluidic device more at a conceptual level while Sim mostly handled the actual fabrication. Me and Tomek were involved in performing experiments which proved the validity of the new microfluidic device along with various characterization experiments of the ET module. Finally I was involved in my own sort of 'fundraising' as I convinced AutoLab Metrohm to provide us (free of cost) with a box of DropSens screen printed electrodes which were later on embedded into the microfluidic device. In addition to this they also provided us with Gold plated Inter-Digitated electrodes (IDE) for the Curli resistance measurement and a commercial potentiostat which was used as the standard device used during characterization.

</P><P><B>Duco</B> – Policy&amp;Practice Manager
In my role as Policy&amp;Practice Manager, I conducted interviews with BDS,KMRD,EODD, and PAX and wrote the respective reports. Besides that, I’ve prepared, presented at, and reported on the RIVM meeting. I conducted the “Desk study concerning landmines” and I’ve written the Policy&amp;Practice wikipages Overview, ELECTRACE, Outlook, and Outreach (except “Dutch National Meet-up”). Also, I prepared the stand at the Zomerfestival. Besides my P&amp;P efforts, I’ve been involved in the modeling of the Landmine Module, the Deterministic Model of EET Complex Assembly, and, to a lesser degree, the FBA. I’ve also written the piece Techniques#DeterministicTheory. As for characterization, I’ve converted most of the raw data to figures. </P><P><B> Janna </B> - PR and Fundraising Manager
As PR and fundraising manager, I have worked on fundraising a lot during the initial months of the project. A large part of the fundraising was also the budget, on which I worked quite a lot. I also helped Duco with the preparations for the Zomerfestival and gave workshops for kids at the event itself. As soon as the labwork got going, however, I spent most of my time in the lab helping out with cloning of the three different modules. Later on in the summer, my focus shifted to the Golden Gate cloning and characterization of the Conductive Curli module. The labwork I did by myself was the collaboration with Wageningen, on which I spent some time in the lab as well. During the project I noticed that my PR job was not meant for me and therefore others mostly took over this job.</P><P><B> Joan </B> – Science Manager and Safety Manager 
Actively participated in the design of the BioBricks and in the development of the cloning strategies to obtain them. Primer design, including the primers for the Golden Gate Assembly method. Development of all sorts of molecular biology work required for the development of our BioBricks in the lab. Worked on the preparation and analysis of the sequencing samples of the received and created BioBricks. Kept in contact with former TU Delft iGEM students to prepare and send samples to collaborate with other iGEM teams. Development and performance of the Characterisation of the Landmine Detection module BioBricks (plate reader and FACS), as well as performance of some of the experiments for the Characterisation of the Conductive Curli module (plate reader and Confocal microscopy). Registered and provided a description of all the constructed BioBricks on the Parts Registry. Development of the Safety Protocol required for the permission of the Safety Manager of TU Delft Applied Sciences faculty to work with certain chemical compounds.</P><P><B> Mariëlle </B>
Personal contributions to the underlying project center on an exploratory literature study of carbon metabolism and protein chemistry with respect to (extracellular) electron transport as well as implementation of experimental techniques regarding, amongst others, cloning. These techniques include handling DNA and genes as discrete elements, put into practice by cloning within the Modules Electron Transport, Conductive Curli and Landmine Detection. Activities covered understanding experimental processes and subsequently improving experimental setup, transforming one species of bacteria to another followed by exploration of (new / gained) functions and overall: approaching challenges multidisciplinary. 
</P><P><B>Sim</B> - Gadget Manager
At the start of the project, I was responsible for facilitating brainstorming for project ideas. Graphic design for logos, posters, and other promotional material was also under my domain. As the gadget manager,  my main responsibility was for the design and exploration of the gadget - this included design and prototyping of the potentiostat, which was carried out with fellow team mate, Debu. A future concept for the application of the Electrace bio-sensor into a product-service system was also designed by myself. During later stages of the project, I was most heavily involved with microfluidics. This involved the fabrication of mother machines, as well as the design of a microfluidic device that includes electrodes along side fellow team mate tomek. Prototyping of the device was performed by myself. Finally, I also had a role in characterisation - this included co-design  and running (with Tomek) of the bio-reactor, and imaging of cells in the Mother Machines in the fluorescence microscope.</P><P><B>Tomek</B> – Science manager
In preparation for the summer I was involved in the study of literature on the ET and CC modules. I was involved in the design of the biobricks and cloning routes used to obtain them as well as the cloning-experiments themselves. I was responsible for the design and manufacturing of the Dropsens fluidics (DS) device, the paper microfluidics and for the manufacturing of the Mother Machine (MM) as well as the use of the MM and DS in experiments. I designed, wrote protocols, reported on and performed the bioreactor, congo red, crystal violet and Gold Nanoparticle experiments. I prepared and attended the RIVM meeting and the BDS interview together with Duco.</P></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
