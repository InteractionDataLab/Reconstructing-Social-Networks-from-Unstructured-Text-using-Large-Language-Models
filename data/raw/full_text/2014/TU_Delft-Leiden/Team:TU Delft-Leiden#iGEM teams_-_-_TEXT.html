Collaboration with other iGEM teams
When doing research every single help can make a difference. Therefore, sharing is caring and iGEM TU Delft Leiden team 2014 believes in this. Below you can find all collaborations we had this year with other iGEM teams:
Exeter iGEM 2014 Team
We were asked by Exeter iGEM 2014 Team to send them the biobricks BBa_K1022115 and BBa_K1022105 from TU Delft iGEM team 2013 and we did. We hope that this little support will help Exeter team to achieve great results.
2014 iGEM Team Linköping University Sweden
iGEM Team Linköping University Sweden asked us to fill in a survey on peanuts allergies. This was a very interesting survey and was a good occasion to take a short break from our experiments. We are looking forward to see the results of the survey
