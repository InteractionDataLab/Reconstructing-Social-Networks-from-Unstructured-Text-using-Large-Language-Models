Module Landmine Detection
Information with respect to literature consulted regarding the Modules is referred to under Context. Also, each of the three complementary Modules is equipped with an Integration of Departments, in which it is described how the Departments Modeling, Experimental Work and Microfluidics interact. Furthermore, each Module contains information on Cloning and results are presented under Characterization.

Keen to see our conclusions for this module?  See the list below!
The two best BioBricks for Landmine detection are LD5 (p[J] incl. N-enzymes) and LD4 (p[F] incl. N-enzymes). The N-genes contribute to sensitivity of the promoters.
The LD5 construct seems to be the most suitable construct for Landmine Detection.
Evidence suggests that the ybiJ and yqjF promoters are activated by 2,4-DNT, but it cannot be totally discarded the possibility that acetonitrile is the trigger of the response of these promoters.
Want to know how we came to these conclusions? Go to our Characterization page!
Interested in one of our other Modules? Navigate to the Module Electron Transport where you can find everything regarding the implementation of the MtrCAB conduit. Interested in living materials? Go to our Module Conductive Curli project and find out how you can combine the benefits of both living- and non-living materials.
