Collaboration with other iGEM teams
When doing research every single help can make a difference. Therefore, sharing is caring and iGEM TU Delft Leiden team 2014 believes in this. Below you can find all collaborations we had this year with other iGEM teams:
Wageningen iGEM 2014
The Wageningen iGEM team asked us to characterize 4 of their BioBricks (M1, M4, M5 and M17 according to the nomenclature of their protocol) in order to have a duplo of their own results. To accomplish that we had to prepare growth medium, grow the cultures, induce them and do a 24-hour plate reader measurement of 65 samples. For more information, read the protocol followed . The results can be found on their page: Wageningen iGEM 2014
In return we asked them to perform our Congo Red protocol for the characterization of our Conductive Curli BioBricks. The results can be found on this page
Exeter iGEM 2014 Team
We were asked by Exeter iGEM 2014 Team to send them the biobricks BBa_K1022115 and BBa_K1022105 from TU Delft iGEM team 2013 and we did. We hope that this little support will help Exeter team to achieve great results.
2014 iGEM Team Linköping University Sweden
iGEM Team Linköping University Sweden asked us to fill in a survey on peanuts allergies. This was a very interesting survey and was a good occasion to take a short break from our experiments. We are looking forward to see the results of the survey
University of Melbourne iGEM team
We were asked by Melbourne iGEM team  2014 Team to send them three biobricks from TU Delft iGEM team 2013. Below are some pictures after the samples arrived to Melbourne iGEM team in Australia.
Imperial iGEM team 2014
We had a Skype meeting with Despoina Paschu, member of the Imperial iGEM team 2014. They wanted to find out how the language  (English) affects the performance and participation of non English speaking teams. The results of this survey, can be found on their Policy&Practice page
