Module Electron Transport
Information with respect to literature consulted regarding the Modules is referred to under Context. Also, each of the three complementary Modules is equipped with an Integration of Departments, in which it is described how the Departments Modeling, Experimental Work and Microfluidics interact. Furthermore, each Module contains information on Cloning and results are presented under Characterization.

Keen to see our conclusions for this module?  See the list below!
The mtrCAB genes under control of the weakened T7lacO promoter were successfully BioBricked.
The ccm genes under control of the pFAB640 promoter were successfully BioBricked.
Expression of both our mtrCAB BioBrick and ccm BioBrick results in Extracellular Electron Transport.
Want to know how we came to these conclusions? Go to our Characterization page!
Interested in one of our other Modules? Navigate to the  Module Landmine Detection page and discover how we tweaked E. coli to let it respond on landmines. Interested in living materials? Go to our Module Conductive Curli and find out how you can combine the benefits of both living- and non-living materials.
