Media
Media outreach is one of the most important things that needs to be done to support your own public relations program of your project. This is a part of our PR program which also encompasses areas like public speaking and social media.
Many media representatives have been contacted in order to draw the public’s attention to our synthetic biology project.
Within the synthetic biology one makes use of genetic modification. But many people are scared of the term ‘genetic modification’, because they are not aware of what this actually means. However synthetic biology is a great possibility to modify organisms so we can use them in a useful way. With this iGEM project we are enable to create awareness of the importance of synthetic biology. That’s why the media outreach is a good way to let people know that genetic modification is not necessarily a bad thing!
The project of the TU Delft iGEM team 2014, Electrace, received a lot of media attention from several newspapers, scientific magazines and also biology & biotechnology associations.
Below you can find a list of our publications, please note that these are not translated since they stem from national/local newspapers, magazines and associations. We did not want to infringe on copyright laws.

Social Media
Facebook and Twitter are great examples of social networking options. It’s possible to draw the attention of a lot of people by inviting your friends to like your page. For this reason we have decided to have a Facebook and Twitter account, enabling us to keep our ‘fans’ up-to-date, during the project about the developments within the project, science and the latest publications.
We have managed to get a lot of likes on our Facebook as well on our Twitter account. Have a look on our pages and YouTube channel for video's representing different modules of our project!
