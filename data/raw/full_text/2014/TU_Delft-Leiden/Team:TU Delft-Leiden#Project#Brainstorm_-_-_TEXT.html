Brainstorming sessions
Our project is a result of a long brainstorming process, whereby the ideas became more and more specific. The brainstorming meetings took place from the very beginning of the project -early February until early May. It was very important for our team to work on an challenging topic, both from an educational perspective, but also to be a hot issue nowadays.  In this way, there is more enthusiasm and energy in the team to work productive for the iGEM project.
Initially we had more than 250 initial ideas. After doing a desk research and having various constructive discussions, we narrowed down our list and had a mid-term presentation where we invited all our advisers and other academic instructors, to ask for their feedback.
Our top eight ideas where:
1.   Electron transporting bacteria
2.  Cheaper drug testing in sports
3.  Recording images in a cell
4.  Microbial Fibres
5.  Desalination of water
6.  Bacteria that can remove chewing from the streets/ degrading rubber
7.  Post-translational modifications
8.  Graphene producing bacteria
Trough extensive desk-research in the following month we narrowed down our list to three main ideas: Electron transporting bacteria (The Winner and currently named "Using ELECTRACE to detect landmines"), Cheaper drug testing in sports and Rubber degrading bacteria. These three ideas were presented to a mass of scientists from TU Delft in order to ask for their feedback.
List of our other ideas
In the list of our ideas, there are no limits in creativity and our ideas can inspire future iGEM teams. We would be happy to figure our that one of our ideas was picked by future iGEM teams
Tooth plaque removal
