Want to know more about the Life Science aspects of the ELECTRACE project? Navigate to our different Modules!         In the Module Electron Transport you can find everything regarding the implementation of the MtrCAB conduit. Interested in conducting biofilms? Visit our Module Conductive Curli and find out how you can combine the benefits of both living- and non-living materials.Go to our Module Landmine Detection and discover how we tweaked E. coli to let it respond to landmines.
Information with respect to literature consulted regarding the Modules is referred to under Context. Also, each of the three complementary Modules is equipped with an Integration of Departments, in which it is described how the Departments Modeling, Experimental Work and Microfluidics interact. Furthermore, each Module contains information on Cloning and results are presented under Characterization.
