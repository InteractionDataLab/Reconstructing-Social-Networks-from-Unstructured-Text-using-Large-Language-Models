Gadget
The goal of synthetic biology is to turn biology from a science into a technology. In order to do this, it needs to be brought out of the lab to fulfil its full potential. A product designed around the electrace whole-cell biosensor would allow for real world application, outside of the confines of the lab.
Figure 1: Concept for a product environment combining the digital and biological worlds, with the Electrace biosensor system.
A concept which allowed for the meeting of the digital and biological worlds was imagined, with the Electrace cell at the heart. Electrace creates a modular system where biosensor "plugins" in the form of biobricks can be designed by "wetware developers". This would allow the electrical output of Electrace to be used with a range of different inputs - for example the DNT detection seen elsewhere in our project. Since each biosensor would have it's own set of requirements for data processing, software developers would create matching plugins for a digital Electrace platform. Via a web-based app then, the user would select the appropriate combination of software for the analyte in question. A wifi enabled potentiostat measures the electrical output of the given Electrace bio-sensor, which then sends this data to the mobile app for processing and display.
