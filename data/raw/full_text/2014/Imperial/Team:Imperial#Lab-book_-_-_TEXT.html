Introduction
We kept a record of our lab work across a variety of online documents as well as paper based lab-books. Access our online working documents on this page.
General Mixed LabWork
This document contains experimental details for some of the following parts of the project
Bulk cellulose growth and processing techniques
Coculture experiments
G. xylinus isolation and culturing
Initial cloning work for Acs operon
Preliminary work for isolating curli genes
Primer Inventory
Primers for sequencing, mutagenesis, Gibson Assembly, overlap extension PCR... here is our inventory
Functionalisation cloning
This lab-book is a break-away from the mixed lab-book and contains details of cloning the constructs used in the functionalisation part of our project.
This spreadsheet also details specific digestions and ligation set-ups for these constructs.
Interlab study cloning
Precise cloning reaction set-ups are detailed here
Gluconacetobacter xylinus
Lab-book exclusively for work on G.xylinus, with parts including:
Strain growth and isolation
Parts library and characterisation
Genomic DNA extraction and library preparation
