We improved the characterisation of parts
Language is an important part of science. We investigated the impact it had on iGEM and the competition
We explored the concept of sustainable water management and wastewater recycling as solutions to water stress. We uncovered key barriers to their implementation and addressed them in our project.
We simulated the bacterial cellulose 3D printing system for London Biohackspace
We experimentally validated our parts
We documented characterisation of our parts on the registry
We submitted new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry
We considered how our biomaterial could be used to address the problem of water purification and investigated the feasibility of doing so by talking with experts
We completed the Team registration
We completed the Judging form
A Team Wiki was designed and constructed
We have prepared a poster and a talk for the iGEM Jamboree.
We have attributed all work to the proper persons
We have submitted parts to the registry
