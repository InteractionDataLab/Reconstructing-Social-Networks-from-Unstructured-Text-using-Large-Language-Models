The ease of genetic engineering and the wealth of other characterized Biobricks increases the potential for exciting future projects</P></SECTION><SECTION id="engineering"><H2>Engineering</H2><P>The cellulose production operon in <EM>Gluconacetobacter xylinus</EM> is a 10kb genomic region, consisting of four main elements:</P><UL><LI>acsAB, known as cellulose synthase, is made up of two domains: acsA being the catalytic domain, and acsB being the cyclic-di-GMP-binding domain. This modular enzyme requires the second messenger cyclic-di-GMP in order to carry out efficient catalysis. (Lee et al., 2014)</LI><LI>acsC codes for an oligomeric element that gets embedded in the extracellular membrane and allows transport of the growing polymer across the cell membrane into the extracellular environment. (Lee et al., 2014)</LI><LI>acsD is believed to be a non-essential element, although it is a key player in the control of cellulose crystallinity and required for maximal cellulose productivity. (Lee et al., 2014)</LI></UL><P>The native operon is highly regulated at transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels. Cellulose production responds to a wide set of internal signals and environmental cues. The native ribosomal binding sites (RBS) are predicted to be weak by translation rate calculators (The <A href="https://salis.psu.edu/software/"> Salis Lab RBS calculator </A> and <A href="http://sbi.postech.ac.kr/utr_designer">  Postech UTR designer </A>). This is perhaps to reduce noise in gene expression (strong promoter, weak RBS is less noisy that weak promoter strong RBS). The promoter region has not yet been characterized in <EM>Gluconacetobacter xylinus</EM>, however. (Kawano et al., 2002)</P><P>The first step of our computational design engineering was to identify the coding sequences and extract them from NCBI. We removed some native regulation by codon-optimizing the sequences for expression in <EM>E.coli</EM> and replaced the native RBS’s with the strong B0034 sequence. The 6 base pairs either side of the B0034 RBS were edited with the Salis Lab RBS calculator design function to tune RBS strength output to better preserve the natural stoichiometry.</P><P>Finally, in order to allow for even more customizable fine-tuning of the system, the operon was divided and cloned into two separate expression vectors: the AcsAB element was cloned under the control of the inducible pBAD promoter contained within pSB1C3, a high copy plasmid that would contribute to higher expression of Cellulose Synthase. Alternatively, AcsC and AcsD, believed to be expressed at lower levels in <EM>G.xylinus</EM>, was put under the control of the pLAC promoter and was transferred into a low copy plasmid, pSB3K3 so as to maintain lower levels of expression. This approach provided the following advantages:</P><UL><LI>Reducing the size of the final expression vector avoids complications during assembly and vector take-up, and it also prevents a large construct from becoming a burden for cell growth and vector propagation.</LI><LI>By expressing the cellulose production machinery from two separate expression vectors, the following levels of control become available to us: the first being the changes in vector copy number, which directly affects gene expression levels throughout induction, and the second being the ability to activate the system using two different inducers. These key features of our system allow for a larger scope for fine-tuning and optimization of cellulose production levels.</LI></UL><FIGURE class="content-image"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 3: pSB-pBAD-AB and pLAC-CD</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><FIGURE class="content-image image-right"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 4: acsABCD fragments</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>With this approach, we allow for our system to be implemented in new range of hosts because a larger set of growth conditions, inducer concentrations and growth phases can be tested in order to achieve the required stoichiometry for the system to become functional.</P><P>In order to ease synthesis, the operon sequence was split into 4 fragments of similar sizes. We took advantage of the presence of two restriction sites: An NcoI present within the AcsAB sequence, and a PvuII site contained within AcsC. Furthermore, the BioBrick prefix and suffix were included and any additional sites removed elsewhere.</P><P>By standard cloning, these fragments could easily be put together to yield the following constructs:</P><FIGURE class="content-image image-small"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 5: acsAB and acsCD constructs</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Gene Designer served as a very useful tool for assembling constructs and predicting cloning outcomes before proceeding with the experimental procedure.

LB, soluble and non-soluble fractions were assayed.</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>Cellulose Production can be easily assayed using the diazo dye Congo Red. Congo Red specifically binds cellulostic fibrils, and this binding can be measured by spectral analysis, because it causes a shift on the spectral properties of the dye, which can be monitored with a spectrophotometer (Klunk et al., 1999). In addition to this, Congo Red also allows for visual, qualitative analysis: it causes a color change of any cellulose-producing colonies by binding to the growing fibres. Therefore, cellulose production can be easily detected by eye on LB Agar plates and liquid cultures (Jolanta Sereikaite and Vladas-Algirdas Bumelis, 2006).</P><P>We assayed cellulose production on LB Agar Congo Red assay plates. Colonies containing the refactored cellulose production machinery turned red within 24h, and presented a rougher composition and brighter red color after 48h. In contrast to this, colonies presenting empty vector (negative controls), presented no color changes and maintained the characteristics of standard <EM>Escherichia coli</EM> colonies (smoother composition and standard yellow colour).</P><P>To confirm this qualitative assay, a second qualitative assay was carried out, also based on Congo Red binding. This second analysis consisted of incubating overnight cultures (both cellulose producers and empty vector controls) with Congo Red as described in Materials and Methods. Cellulose producers will present growing cellulose fibres on their extracellular surface, hence will dye red in the presence of Congo Red, unlike non-cellulose-producing cells. After spinning down the cells, a red pellet was observed that corresponded to the cellulose producing colonies. In contrast to this, negative controls did not bind Congo Red and hence maintained the standard E.coli characteristics. We consider that this qualitative data supports our design and confirms that the cellulose production operon has been successfully refactored and transferred into <EM>Escherichia coli</EM>.</P><P>In order to gain a better understanding of the activity of the Acs elements in Escherichia coli, it was of interest to explore whether the AcsAB element alone would be enough to achieve cellulose production. AcsAB is embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane and transports the growing polymer through the membrane as it attaches the glucose monomers in the cytoplasm.  In the absence of AcsC and AcsD, no cellulose can be secreted into the environment and as a result, it was assumed that it would instead become accumulated in the cell’s periplasm. For this reason, during characterization we required sonication in order to get the cellulose (if any at all) out of the cells.</P><P>To widen our screening, we set up induced samples and uninduced controls and assayed samples at different temperatures (30°C versus 37°C) and different conditions (shaking versus static) in the presence or absence of 1% D-Glucose. Furthermore, 2 Biological replicates were assayed, and technical triplicates were also set up during plate reading to support any statistically relevant findings. Although we expected no cellulose to be accumulating in the medium, we still analysed all fractions originating throughout the procedure: LB fractions, soluble fractions and non-soluble fractions (called membrane fractions throughout this study).</P><P>All fractions were incubated in the presence of Congo Red (as described in Materials and Methods) and were later inoculated into a 96-well plate for absorbance measurements at 490nm. Free Congo Red has a maximal absorption at such wavelength. By setting up a control sample, containing solvent (PBS)+ Congo Red, it is possible to measure the total absorbance of the molecule whilst free in solution. When cellulolytic samples are incubated in the presence of Congo Red, less azodye molecules becomes available in the medium due to binding, hence absorbance levels will decrease. The total Congo Red bound will equal the absorbance of Congo Red Control minus the absorbance of our samples of interest. This approach gives you an idea of the amount of Congo Red that may have bound to the cellulositic fibres, but it does not provide exact values of cellulose present.</P><FIGURE class="content-image image-half"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 17: LB fraction - Congo Red Binding</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>As expected, LB fractions all presented similar, non-cellulolytic composition and hence displayed no changes in absorbance, indicating no CR binding. </P><FIGURE class="content-image image-half"><FIGCAPTION>Figure 18: Membrane Fraction - Induction of the pBAD-AcsAB</FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>It was observed that interestingly, membrane fractions that had been previously incubated at 30 C presented a dramatic change in Congo Red binding. This proves not only that the AcsAB is active (at least to some extent) in the absence of AcsC and AcsD, but also that it may be optimal for the cellulose synthase to be folded and functional at lower temperatures, as it occurs in the native host G.xylinus. </P></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="references"><H2>References</H2><OL><LI>Kawano, S.; Tajima, K., Uemori, Y.; Yamashita, H.; Erata, T.; Munekata, M.; Takai, M.
