Introduction
We approached cellulose production and modification with several key questions: Which conditions produce the greatest yields? When should we induce over-production? How efficient will our functionalised cellulose be? We performed in-silico experiments, informed by our wet-lab work, to study growth, cellulose synthesis and the activity of our biomaterial. The results were integrated back into our experiments to enhance the production and function of our biomaterial.
Induction Model
ATCC53582 is capable of inducible high yielding bacterial cellulose production controlled by IPTG concentrations. This model predicts the optimal time of inducing cellulose production during bacterial population growth in order to maximise yields.

CBD Kinetics Model
The kinetics of attaching cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) to cellulose can be modelled using differential equations. This model calculates the time required for a specified percentage of binding sites on bacterial cellulose to be saturated given an initial concentration of available CBDs.

Nutrient Diffusion Simulations
This approach simulates the growth and maintenance of cell population under satisfied nutrient condition as well as taking individual cell motility into consideration and attempting to capture the decision making and orienting processes of each cell.

BioHackspace Model
The collaboration is dedicated to provide London BioHackspace iGEM Team an easy approach to simulate the 3D shape of their bacterial cellulose (BC) sculpture.
