Introduction
We approached cellulose production and modification with several key questions: Which conditions produce the greatest yields? When should we induce over-production? How efficient will our functionalised cellulose be? We performed in-silico experiments, informed by our wet-lab work, to study growth, cellulose synthesis and the activity of our biomaterial. The results were integrated back into our experiments to enhance the production and function of our biomaterial.
