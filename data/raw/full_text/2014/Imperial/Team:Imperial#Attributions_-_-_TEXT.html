Introduction
Our project would not have been possible without the hard work and advice of a whole host of people. On this page you can find who has contributed what to the project.
The Team
The team consisted of bioengineers and life scientists. You can find out who we are here . We came up with idea for the project at the beginning of July through an internal brainstorming process and developed it independently. Unless otherwise stated, all the experiments, constructs, code and results documented on this wiki was performed and collected by us, the students. The wiki was designed and constructed by the team with a foundational homepage design by Nestor Azevedo Pestana (RCA).

CSynBi Instructors and Advisors
We would like to acknowledge the feedback and advice provided by our instructors and advisors from CSynBi . Special thanks to Ben Reeve, Catherine Ainsworth and Nicolas Kral who spent countless hours supervising us in the lab.
Acknowledgments
Many other people, from Imperial and beyond, contributed their expertise to specific aspects of our project.
Modelling
Dr Guy-Bart Stan (Bioengineering, Imperial College) advised us on modelling approaches and who to contact
Dr John Pinney (Life Sciences, Imperial College) advised us on modelling approaches
Functionalisation and Processing
Dr Andreas Mautner (Polymer and Composite Engineering, Imperial College) is a postdoctoral researcher who discussed his work on cellulose-based filters and the limitations of chemical functionalisation.
Dr Koon-Yang Lee (Chemical Engineering, UCL) shared his expertise on the production and processing of bacterial cellulose
Dr Angelo Karunaratne (Royal British Legion Centre for Blast Injury Studies, Imperial College) advised us on methods for testing of bacterial cellulose's mechanical properties and provided us with access to an Instron tensile testing machine (5866)
Water Treatment
Dr Michael Templeton (Civil and Environmental Engineering, Imperial College) talked to us about EU pesticide regulation and and current filtration processes
Dr Sandy Cairncross (London School of Health and Tropical Medicine) discussed with us the viability of point of use filters and led us to think about more industrial applications
Ray Heslop (Engineering Advisor, WaterAid) met with us to discuss the importance of sustainable, appropriate solutions.
Biserka Pop Stefanija (Water Sanitation Advisor, Médecins Sans Frontières) gave us insights into how our filter could be used by quick response agencies in bulk treatment for temporary storage
Dr Michael Chipps (Principal Research Scientist, Thames Water) and his colleagues informed us of industrial techniques including the use of cellulose acetate membranes in membrane bioreactors
Policy and Practices
Prof Constant Leung (King’s College London) advised us on the language study we conducted
Dr Claire Marris (King’s College London) advised us on the social dimensions of synthetic biology
Dr Catherine Jefferson (King’s College London) advised us on the social dimensions of synthetic biology
Art and Design
Nestor Azevedo Pestana (RCA) provided an initial homepage design for the wiki and the team logo
Victoria Geaney (freelance fashion designer) helped designing the cellulose garments
Phil Townsend (Sustainable Raw Materials Specialist, Marks and Spencers) discussed the use of man-made cellulosic materials as an alternative to cotton
Zuzana Gombosova (freelance design researcher) shared her experience on processing cellulose pellicles into different materials
Nico Ortiz (freelance photographer) took the official group and individual pictures of the team.
Outreach
Dr Emma Robertson (Imperial College) provided us with slots in summer school programmes for us to talk about synthetic biology and our project
Dr Jenna Stevens-Smith (Outreach and Public Engagement Manager, Dept. of Bioengineering, Imperial College) helped us plan the Year 10 Engineering Biology workshop
