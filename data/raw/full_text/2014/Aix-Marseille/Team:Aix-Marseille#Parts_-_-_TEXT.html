relA
Description
The relA gene encodes a ppGpp synthetase. In bacteria, ppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5-' diphosphate) acts as a signaling molecule that regulates a variety of cellular metabolisms in response to changes in the nutritional state of the cells. The relA sequence amplified from E. coli W3110 was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to remove the PstI site.

CusR box
Description
The CusR box allow the binding of the CusR regulator. In E. coli, the CusR/CusS two-component system induces expression of genes involved in metal efflux under condition of elevated Cu concentration. Phosphorylated CusR specifically bind to CusR-dependent promoters.
