Annealing Oligonucleotides
Make a reaction mix containing 5 μL of 10X buffer, 35 μL of H2O, 5 μL of Primer1 (10 μM) and 5 μL of Primer2 (10 μM).
Place tube in a standard heat block at 90-95°C for 3 to 5 minutes.
Remove the heat block from the apparatus and allow to cool to room temperature (or at least below 30°C) on the workbench. Slow cooling to room temperature should take 45 to 60 minutes (Can be done overnight).
Store on ice or at 4°C until ready to use.
Note :
If it doesn't work, try with 5 µl of the 100 µM primer solutions.
