Dr. Cardineau began his career in the field of Agricultural Biotechnology in 1983 as a Scientist at a small start-up company, Sungene Technologies, where he also served a short time as Manager of Market Development. He moved and then Director of Molecular Biology. He has 28 issued US patents and 19 published applications and over 140 patent and application worldwide. These works include; broad enabling patents describing the earliest production of vaccines in transgenic plants, the synthesis of genes to improve their expression in a foreign host and the only plant made vaccines approved by a regulatory authority for commercial release.
