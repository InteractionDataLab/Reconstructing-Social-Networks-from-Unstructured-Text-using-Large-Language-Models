He just graduated from BS in Biotechnology Engineering. Three times iGEMer, Camilo’s experience was helpful to help us sort out problems  in the lab. He was always there willing to give us some advice about technical and human issues. Also, he helped us contact some of the other Mexican iGEM teams to generate a better human practice.

Sergio is a researcher in the FEMSA Biotechnology Center, where he is currently working in his Ph.D. He obtained a major in Biology in the Autonomous University of Baja California. He enjoys listening to music, going for a walk, discovering new restaurants (quite a few vegetarian ones). He has great advice for our project although he also likes to teach us the hard way.

César is a graduate biologist from Baja California and is currently working at the Biotechnology Center at the Molecular Biology Division. He is a relaxed person who enjoys helping every possible time and way. He has a very critical and empathetic opinion to improve the work of the others while maintaining harmony. He kindly provided us with the phage M13 and the phagemid.

Luis Fernando just graduated from B.S. in Biotechnology Engineering from our Campus. Twice iGEMer, his involvement is part of the commitment with the team. This year, he helped us with the design the first module of the project, his feedback and ideas always provided us with some insight on our initial problems. Though he left us at the beginning of the summer, we know his heart and support are always with us.
