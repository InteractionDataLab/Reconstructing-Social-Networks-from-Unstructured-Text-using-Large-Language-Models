Rolando Zubirán
He was the main contact with the State government and helped us get a sponsorship from them.
Dr. Mario Moisés Alvarez
For all his support in the project, especially with the mini-bioreactor and the flow cytometer as well as the anti-igG antibodies.
M. Sc. Irasema Romo López
Gave us mammalian cell lines and kindly advised us in how to make the apoptosis tests.
B.S. Luis Mario Leal
One of our past team leaders, he gave us material and technical support.
Felipe López Pacheco
We are grateful with him for giving us the anti-igG antibody and helping us with the design of the experiment.
Carlos Alberto Silva Ruiz (Charlie)
Always lent us material from the lab.
Dr. Adriana Pacheco
Teached us how to use the fluorescence microscope.
Beatriz Moreno
Prepared for us a microplate with RAW cells, which was essential for the immune response test.
Erika Ortega
She was very helpful with all the material acquisition, and getting everything done.
Dra. Mary Rocha
For her advice regarding the project.
Marilena Antunes
Advised us in the apoptosis tests.
UANL team
Helped us clone our parts into the pSB1C3 vector and performed several mutagenesis PCR of the M13 phage genome for us.
Ana (Anita) Infante
We thank her for all her advice, encouragement and all the iGEM stuff she let us know.
Kitwa Ng
We thank him for sending the biobricks we asked for, although they couldn’t reach home. And also for being patient and answer all our questions.
Carlos Astengo Noguez, Dolores Coronado, Margarita Morales
For their help in the human practices.
Eloisa María Fernández Rangel, Donato Cárdenas
Advised us in how to present the reform for the importation of research material.

FEMSA Biotechnology Center Staff and Biotechnology Department
For giving us access to the lab, patience and advice in general
Lic. Luis Omar Peña Ortega, Director of the Division of Biotechnology and Food Industries
We appreciate his attention to our problems and quick solutions
Dr. Gilberto Armienta, Director of the School of Biotechnology and Health Sciences
For letting us know that we had all his support in the development of our project.
i4 Chair
For this project we were positioned under the scheme of this chair to administrate our funding and role in the school. The students chair (i4) is a opportunity offered by the Tecnológico de Monterrey in Monterrey, through its School of Biotechnology and Health Sciences, to students interested in biotechnology and food industries develop projects in the area. The concept is based on four core values:
Imagine.
Investigate.
Innovate.
Incubate.
Student teams, like ours, that want to apply your project may reach hatching their own business, running an article in scientific research, process your patent application and compete internationally. We are specally grateful with them for their generous sponsorship, that allowed us to get the genes and some material for the project.
School of Biotechnology and Health Sciences (ESCB: Escuela de Biotecnología y Ciencias de la Salud)
The School of Biotechnology and Health Sciences integrates talent, infrastructure and curriculum design to provide the best educational, research and knowledge transfer in Mexico and Latin America. Our school combines science and technology to create value and quality of life in society, and sustainable processes and performed with the highest degree of social responsibility. Thus, our motto "Integrating Science, Technology and Business" describes the vision of outcomes generated in every academic program.
FEMSA Biotechnology Center
The FEMSA Biotechnology Center in the Tecnológico de Monterrey integrates researchers from several academic departments to create interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary groups. Also, it's dedicated to generate research, knowledge transfer and business design models in food and biotechnology areas. It emerged 15 years ago as a response to the growing trend in scientific and technological innovation in the country and the whole world. Through time, the Biotechnology Center has developed lines of biotechnology research directed toward the innovation of processes, products, and services.
Tecnológico de Monterrey
Our institution Tecnológico de Monterrey located in Monterrey, Nuevo León, which was founded on 1943 by Eugenio Garza Sada and a group of businessmen formed a civil- and nonprofit partnership, named Higher Education and Research, A.C.
Based in Monterrey, Mexico, the Institute has 31 campuses in 25 cities throughout the countryand is known for becoming the first university ever connected to the Internet in Latin America, having one of the top graduate business schools in the region and being one of the leaders in patent applications among Mexican universities.
Today, the Tecnológico de Monterrey is a multicampus system with five common core values: innovation, global vision, team work, humanistic outlook and integrity.
