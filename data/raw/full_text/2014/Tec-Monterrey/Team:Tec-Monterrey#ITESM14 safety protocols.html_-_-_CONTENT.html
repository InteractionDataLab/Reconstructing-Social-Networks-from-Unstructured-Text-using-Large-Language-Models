			Within our institution is self-regulated and trains its researchers with biosafety guidelines without a formal online version of them, in order to work in the lab many of us have already received a basic training in charge of the main laboratory. The project needed approval from the equivalent group of an Institutional Biosafety Committee at our institution which is formed by Dr. Silverio García Lara, Dr. Rocio Diaz and Dr. Guy A. Cardineau, who is one of the advisors of the team. They gave us feedback regarding the mammalian cell lines and the bacteriophage that were going to be used, which are some of the most sensitive elements of our project. Thus, actions were taken at different levels to protect the people within the lab and other people who also use it because our job is to minimize the probability of being exposed to any danger.

			About the bacteriophages, we are needed to be extra careful when working because it has a peptide that enables the internalization when it finds the cancer-specific receptor (GRP78). This receptor is found in cells that have stress in the endoplasmic reticulum, caused by hypoxia and low glucose levels in the environment (tumor-like environment). According to various studies the amount of receptors in the normal cells is not enough to make probable the internalization. So the risk of handling the bacteriophages in controlled areas is very low.

			We desingned our bacteria to produce its recombinant bacteriophage under a quorum sensing system and also, it will only transfect cancer cell lines, which limits and lowers the possible risks. Also the strains that we are going to use cannot survive outside laboratory conditions for more than two weeks as they are derivated from E.coli K12, so the probability of producing bacteriophages outside the lab conditions is very low.

			To reduce these kind of risks we are going to work according to the safe lab practices and we are going to dispose the wastes correctly. In addition, we are using E. coli strains that cannot survive outside laboratory conditions for more than two weeks. So the risk of an accidental production of our therapy outside lab conditions is limited.

					In the sample preparation, ß-mercaptoethanol and SDS are needed, and both have toxic effects, especially ß-mercaptoethanol. To keep the biosafety standards, it was necessary to minimize the time of exposure to any of these materials, by using nitrile gloves and within the designated space.
					&lt;/br&gt;
					Coomassie Blue is a known flammable toxin that targets some of our organs. It is prepared in a “fixating solution”, which contains methanol, acetic acid and water. For the preparation of this solution, an air-extraction cabinet is needed. The dispose of all the generated wastes in a bin we labeled “PAGE wastes”, separated from the normal wastes.
