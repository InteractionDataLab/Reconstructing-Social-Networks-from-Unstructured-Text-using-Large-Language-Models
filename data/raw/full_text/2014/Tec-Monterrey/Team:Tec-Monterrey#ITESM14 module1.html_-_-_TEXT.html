Aim
<section id="column">
The project this year is a continuation of last year’s project <a href=" https://2013.igem.org/Team:TecMonterrey " target="_blank">iGem Tecnológico de Monterrey 2013</a> in which the team developed a modified Escherichia coli that was able to deliver a pro-apoptotic protein (Apoptin) to kill cancer cells. The aim of this module was to address one of the most relevant issues of our past project: the immune response caused by the introduction of bacteria to the blood. Thus, we attempted to remove a significant amount of endotoxins found on the membrane of E. coli in order to prevent and/or reduce the impact of the possible immunological response caused by the bacterial therapy. </b>

Background
Escherichia coli and cancer
<section id="column">
Last year our team developing a bacterial therapy, based on the fact that E. coli it’s able to colonize hypoxic environments, such as tumors.Nevertheless, the risk of causing septic shock was a significant issue. Thus, in this project we aimed to find a solution for this problem.
</section>
Endotoxins
<section id="column">
Endotoxins are outer membrane components native to gram negative bacteria, specifically, for project matters,Escherichia coli. Endotoxins are a primary concern in project design due to adverse reactions that these can trigger from the human system, in particular, septic shock [1].This module is focused on two different endotoxins: lipopolysaccharides and murein lipoprotein.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are composed of a membrane side in lipid, (Lipid A) and an outer polysaccharide (0-Antigen), these are joined by a core polysaccharide region [6]. LPS rests in the outer bacterial cell membrane and is known to cause most of the endotoxin-related inflammations in humans.
Murein lipoprotein (Braun’s lipoprotein) endotoxin consists of peptidoglycan and a lipid subsection, bound together by lysine. It serves a structural purpose within the cell, holding the rigid membrane together due to its strongly interacting bonds [1]. Furthermore, it induces a LPS-like reaction, due to toll-like receptor 2 recognition of Braun’s Lipoprotein [5]. Additionally, it works in synergy with LPS in septic shock rising events [10].
The immune system is able to detect Endotoxins through specific toll-like receptors [5]. LPS interacts with TLR4 and its coreceptor, myeloid differentiation protein 2. Braun’s lipoprotein binds with TLR2. Both Lpp and LPS induce toxic and biological responses within hosts through the receptor binding and consequent induction of innate immune system production of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, gamma interferon, interleukin-1-beta, and IL-6 [9], these of which are prone to trigger inflammation when produced in great amounts.

</br> Engineering E. coli’s membrane to remove LPS and Braun’s lipoprotein reduces the chance of toll-like receptors 4 and 2 to react abruptly. Decreasing the concentration of these endotoxins will inhibit the triggering of their corresponding toll-like receptors, subsequently reducing inflammation. This will reduce further impairment due to auto-immune complications in the individual receiving bacterial therapy. [2].
For the endotoxin removal, both genes, msbb and lpp will be deleted from E.coli’s genome. These genes are, naturally, the most relevant to the production of inflammation factors msbB for the impairment of meristic acid transporter formation crucial in LPS toxicity and lpp Braun’s Lipoprotein. The phage lambda-derived Red recombination system was chosen for the engineering of E. coli’s genome due to its highly specific sequence targeting and simplicity. For a detailed procedure of the experimental protocol of how the red lambda system works <a href=" http://cdn.b-bridge.com/products/K003_Protocol.pdf " target="_blank"> click here</a>.

Biobricks
Two constructs, C1 and C2, which are required by the red lambda system were designed for the gene knockout. These contain antibiotic resistance genes, and the LuxR or LuxI sequences flanked by 50 bp homologous to the genes msBb and lpp to be deleted.  The purpose of these sequences is detailed in <a href="#tab_module3" target="_blank"> Module 3 </a>.
C1 (<a href=" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1366101 " target="_blank"> BBa_K1366101</a>)
<section id="column">
This construct contains the sequence homologies of 50 bp to delete the lpp gene (Braun’s lipoprotein). It includes an ampicillin resistance gene and the sequences for the LuxR synthesis (when this protein is coupled with the homoserine lactone (AHL), it activates the transcription of genes controlled by the lux box). The flippase recognition target (FRT) sequences included are used to remove the antibiotic resistance with a specific recombinase. For more detail on the role of AHL and FRT, refer to <a href="#tab_module3" target="_blank"> Module 3 </a>.
Its general structure is as follows:
lpp // FRT // Amp Promoter // RBS // AmpR // Terminator // FRT // Promoter J23100// RBS// LuxR // Terminator // lpp
