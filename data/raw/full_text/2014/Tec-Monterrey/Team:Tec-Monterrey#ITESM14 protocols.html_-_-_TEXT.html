Steps 1. Select and cast the appropriate base (separating) gel. The amounts of reagents required for two gels with dimensions 0.07 × 14 × 14 cm and containing 10% and 16% acrylamide are given in the table that follows. Do not degas the gel mixtures, because the gel buffer contains SDS. Overlay the poured gels with several drops of water. Leave the gels for about 30 min to polymerize. The freshly prepared ammonium persulfate (APS) solution and TEMED should be added last, immediately before pouring the gels, because these polymerize the gels.

2. Overlay the polymerized separating gel (10% or 16%, or 16%/6 M urea) directly with a 4% sample (stacking) gel, except if resolution of proteins <5 kDa is desired. If resolution of proteins <5 kDa is desired, then use AB-6 instead of AB-3 for the separating gel and overlay the separating gel with a 1-cm 10% gel. The 16% separating gel and the overlaid 10% ‘spacer gel’ can be polymerized together if no glycerol is added to the 10% acrylamide gel mixture (the common role of glycerol in SDS gels is to increase the density of solutions and to facilitate gel casting; it has no obvious effect on protein separation). Introducing a 10% ‘spacer gel’ between 4% stacking and 16% separating gels considerably sharpens the bands for proteins and peptides of 1–5 kDa. 3. Adjust protein concentrations so that a suitable amount of protein can be loaded onto the gel. Concentrate samples, preferentially by techniques that do not increase the salt concentration (such as ultrafiltration). Roughly 0.2–1 µg of protein for each protein band (in 0.7 × 5 mm gel strips) is sufficient for Coomassie staining. Accordingly, the desired protein concentration in the sample is 0.1 mg ml–1 for each protein band. 4. Mix samples with SDS-containing sample buffers. The volume and buffer to be used depend on the origins of the samples. For low-density samples such as elution fractions from chromatographic columns, add 5 µl of reducing or nonreducing sample incubation buffer A or B to 15 µl of sample. For high-density samples such as fractions from sucrose density gradients, add 5 µl of sample buffer C or D to 15 µl of sample. For pellet samples, resuspend the pellet in 15–20 µl of buffer A/4 or B/4. 5. Incubate samples at 37 °C for 15 min or for up to 60 min for samples that were in pellet form. Avoid boiling samples, because membrane proteins can irreversibly aggregate in SDS at temperatures >50 °C. 6. Mount the gels in the vertical electrophoresis apparatus, and add anode buffer as the lower electrode buffer and cathode buffer as the upper electrode buffer. 7. Load samples under the cathode buffer. Apply 10-µl sample volumes to 0.7 × 5 mm sample wells. 8. Set running conditions appropriate to your type of gel; guidance on appropriate running conditions are given in the table below.

9. Protein can be visualized directly in the gel by Coomassie staining or silver staining. Both Coomassie staining and silver staining can be done providing Coomassie staining is done first. Both procedures are compatible with subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. Alternatively, the proteins can be transferred to a PVDF membrane by electroblotting. Waste disposal

Material
Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL)
Stop Solution
E. coli endotoxin standard
Color standards
0.1N sodium hydroxide
0.1N hydrochloric acid
Equipment & Apparatus
Endotoxin free tubes and tips
Spectrometer (Thermo)
Water Bath (Thermo)
Incubator (Tal Boys)
Previous steps
Dilute test specimen using LAL Reagent Water, adjust pH to 6-8 with 0.1N sodium hydroxide or 0.1N hydrochloric acid.
Prepare 1EU/ml endotoxin solution before making standard serial dilutions. In each assay, at least four endotoxin standard solutions covering desired concentration range should be prepared to generate a standard curve. If the endotoxin concentration for the test sample is expected to be in the range of 0.01 - 0.1 EU/ml, the serial endotoxin standard solutions could be 0.1, 0.05, 0.025 and 0.01 EU/ml, respectively. If the endotoxin concentration in sample is expected in the range of 0.1 - 1 EU/ml, the serial endotoxin standard solutions could be 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1 EU/ml, respectively.
Steps
1.
Dispense 100µL of standard or test sample into endotoxin-free vials. Mix samples for 30 minutes with a vortexer. Each test must include a blank as well as at least four endotoxin standards in duplicate. The blank sample vial contains 100 μl of LAL Reagent Water instead of test sample.
2.
Add 100 µl of reconstituted LAL to each vial. Cap the vials and mix well by swirling gently.
3.
If the endotoxin concentration in sample is expected in the range of 0.01 - 0.1 EU/ml, incubate the rack with all vials at 37°C±1°C for T1 using a water bath or heating block. If the endotoxin concentration is expected in the range of 0.1 - 1 EU/ml, incubate at 37°C±1°C for T2. T1 Time ranges from 40 to 60 minutes, and T2 Time ranges from 8 to 16 minutes.
4.
After proper incubation, add 100 µl of reconstituted chromogenic substrate solution to each vial. Cap the vials and swirl gently to mix well. Do not shake or vortex to avoid foaming. Incubate at 37°C±1°C for 6 minutes.
5.
Add 500 µl of reconstituted Color-stabilizer #1 (Stop Solution) to each vial and swirl gently to mix well. Do not shake or vortex to avoid foaming. Add 500 µl of reconstituted Color-stabilizer #2 to each vial and mix well. Finally add 500 µl of reconstituted Color-stabilizer #3 to each vial. Gently swirl each vial to mix well. Bubbles must be avoided.
6.
Read the absorbance of each reaction vial at 545 nm using distilled water as blank to adjust the photometer to zero absorbance.

10X Wash Buffer

Detection Reagent 1
Primary Antibody
Equipment & Apparatus

Previous steps
Prepare reagents:
Reaction volume
Restriction Enzyme
Fast Western 1X Wash Buffer
Mix 1 part of the Fast Western 10X Wash Buffer with 9 parts of water.
Primary Antibody Working Solution
Shake the Fast Western Antibody Diluent well before use. Dilute the primary antibody with diluent to a concentration ranging from 0.2 to10 μg/ml. Use ~0.125 ml of antibody per cm2 of membrane (e.g., 10 ml per 8 × 10 cm blot). The stability of diluted primary antibodies varies depending on the antibody. For best results prepare working dilution immediately before use.
Fast Western Optimized HRP Reagent Working Dilution
Mix 1 part of Fast Western Optimized HRP Reagent with 9 parts of Fast Western Antibody Diluent. Use 0.125 ml per cm2 of membrane (e.g., 10 ml per 8 × 10 cm blot). For best results, use this solution within 1 hour.
Detection Reagent Working Solution
Mix Detection Reagents 1 and 2 at 1:1. Use 0.125 ml Working Solution per cm2 of membrane (e.g., 10 ml per 8 × 10 cm blot). For best results prepare working solution immediately before use (Step 9). The working solution is stable for up to 1 hour at room temperature.
Transfer of proteins: Detailed instructions for the transfer process can be found on the websites of the manufacturers of transfer apparatus, and will vary depending on the system. The principle is the same in each case though. In wet transfer, the gel and membrane are sandwiched between sponge and paper (sponge/paper/gel/membrane/paper/sponge) and all are clamped tightly together after ensuring no air bubbles have formed between the gel and membrane. The sandwich is submerged in transfer buffer to which an electrical field is applied. The negatively-charged proteins travel towards the positively-charged electrode, but the membrane stops them, binds them, and prevents them from continuing on. A standard buffer for wet transfer is the same as the 1X Tris-glycine buffer used for the migration/running buffer without SDS but with the addition of methanol to a final concentration of 20%. For proteins larger than 80 kD, it is recommended that SDS is included at a final concentration of 0.1%. Steps 1. Remove blot from the transfer apparatus and place in a clean incubation tray. 2. Briefly wash blot in Fast Western 1X Wash Buffer to remove transfer buffer. 3. Add the Primary Antibody Working Dilution to the blot and incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT) with shaking. 4. Remove blot from the primary antibody solution and place it in a clean incubation tray. 5. Add the Fast Western Optimized HRP Reagent Working Dilution and incubate for 10 minutes at RT with shaking. Higher sensitivity can be obtained by increasing the incubation time to 15 minutes; however, one or more additional washes will be required to reduce background. 6. Remove blot from the HRP solution and place it in a clean incubation tray. 7. Wash membrane by suspending it in approximately 20 ml of Fast Western 1X Wash Buffer and agitating for 5 minutes. Repeat this wash twice. 8. Remove blot and place it in a clean incubation tray. Add the Detection Reagent Working Solution and incubate for 1-5 minutes at RT. 9. Remove blot from Detection Reagent Working Solution and place it in a plastic sheet protector or clear plastic wrap. Use an absorbent tissue to remove excess liquid and to carefully press out any bubbles from between the blot and the membrane protector. 10. Expose the blot to film or use your preferred imaging method. Waste disposal
