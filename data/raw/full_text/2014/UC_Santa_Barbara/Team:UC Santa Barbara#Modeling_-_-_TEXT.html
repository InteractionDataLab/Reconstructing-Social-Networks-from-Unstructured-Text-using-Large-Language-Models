We started a project to create a 3-D model that visualizes intracellular biological processes. We hoped to take advantage of UCSB's one of a kind Allosphere , a 3-story immersive audio/visual experience, to inspire young students to take an interest in molecular biological research. The challenge proved to be immense, and the project will not be completed in time for the jamboree. We look forward to possibly debuting it at next year's competition, and eventually to the scientific community as a whole.
