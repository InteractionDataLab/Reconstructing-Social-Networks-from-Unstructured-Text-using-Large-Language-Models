7/24/14 John + Hiro - Colonies formed! - We must check to make sure correct plasmid was transfected                        Take samples of colonies and grow them overnight in liquid LB medium                        *Add 2mL LB broth to test tube w/ 4uL of ampicillin (pTrc99A is Amp resistant)                        *Set in warm room to grow overnight
7/25/14 John + Hiro - Miniprep plasmid from cultures, digest and check for correct sized drop out band                          Miniprep protocol:                            *Take 1mL of overnight culture from heat shock, spin down at 15K for 2 minutes and remove all LB                              *Add 250uL P1 buffer, 250uL P2 buffer (to lyse cells), 350uL N3 buffer to precipitate proteins                                     NOTE: Be careful not to mix too hard or chromosome will shear and contaminate plasmids                            *Spin down at 15K RPM for 10-12 minutes                            *Transfer supernatant to miniprep column, put miniprep column on vacuum collection apparatus                            *Vacuum through, add 500uL PB, 750uL PE, 250uL PE again.                            *Take miniprep column off, spin at 15K RPM in waste collection tubes                            *Take out, transfer to eppendorf tubes, add 50uL elution buffer *Spin down at 15K for 30 seconds, collect DNA in eppendorf tubes.                     Once DNA is collected, run digest with EcoRI and PstI and run on a gel                              -CysK-T25 insert is ~1.8 kilobase pairs in size                            Results:
Insert in every lane was >1.8KBP, so incorrect plasmid was transformed. Possibly contamination?
8/4/14 John - Restart OE-PCR of CysK-T25 and re-transform into cells            Today: Set up overnight Overlapping-extension (OE) PCR - Use TAQ, PFU, and VENT polymerase this time, change to 5 minute extension period (72 degrees)
8/11/14 John + Travis - Digest PCR product from TAQ, check for PCR quality with gel, digest pTrc99A, gel purify DNA - Left overnight in 4 degree refrigerator.
8/12/14 John - Transform ligated PCR product into X90 cells, plate them out.            Set in 37 degree warm room overnight
8/13/14 John - Miniprep overnight cultures, digest, and check for proper plasmid transformation                          Results:
So it worked, although the blurriness indicates low quality PCR with many incomplete extension segments. Used lanes 1, 2 (TAQ), 4, 5 (VENT) for ligation step.
8/14/14 John - transform cells into X90 Cells, culture overnight in warm room
8/15/14 John - Miniprep cells, digest resulting plasmid and check for correct plasmid transfection.  Results:
Insert is >1.8KBP, must re-do PCR again.
8/16/14 John (Happy Saturday!) - Restart PCR, this time using VENT polyermase
8/18/14 John - Digest PCR product, Purify from gel, ligate
8/19/14 John - Transform PCR Product into X90 cells, Grow overnight
8/20/14 John - Colonies! Grow them up overnight in Liquid LB medium
8/25/14 John - Miniprep clones and digest with EcoRI and PstI, run out on gel.  Results:
Success! Lanes 1 and 6 display the correct ~1.8kbp dropout! It Worked!
8/26/14 Travis - Send plasmids to UC Berkeley for sequencing to verify correct insert                       Result: Indeed correct plasmid was inserted (yay!)
9/3/14 John - Subclone CysK-T25 from pTrc99A to pCH450 (pTrc99A is Amp resistant, pCH450 is Tetracycline resistant)                 Purpose is to make sure that plasmid backbone for our multiple plasmids don't have interfering antibiotic resistances.                     Result:
Success!
9/3/14 - 10/5/14 - Begin planning process for making cognate I-T18 plasmid                        I-T18 only existed as part of a larger cassette, so we must PCR off the section we want                    Also finals were this time and a 2 week vacation was taken.
10/6/14 John - Begin PCR to extract I-T18 sequence from plasmid. Also, subclone CysK-T25 into pSB1C3 to send to iGEM HQ for judging.        Subclone Results:
No success.
10/8/14 Travis + John - Digest I-T18 PCR product and ligate into pTrc99A (Amp Resistant)
10/9/14 John - Begin making CyA- knockout bacteria that will house all of our plasmids. To generate a reporter for cAMP production, we need to introduce a GFP downstream of a pPap promoter (respondent to cAMP)                We must use a phage to transduce GFP to the chromosome of our background cell line.                      -Start by culturing 3 GFP mutant strains overnight                Also today - Transform I-T18 ligation product into X90 cells, and miniprep CysK-T25 SB1C3 cell lines again to check for correct ligation.            CysK-T25 second subclone results:
Luckily one of the original colonies had the correct ligation - Just in time to overnight the shipment to iGEM HQ.
10/9/14               This is where our journal ends. We will continue the phage transduction and I-T18 cloning, and plan on presenting our full system to the iGEM 2014 International Jamboree. See you there !
