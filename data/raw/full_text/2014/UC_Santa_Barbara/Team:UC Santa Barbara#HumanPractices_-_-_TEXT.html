Team UCSB firmly believes that the best way to ensure the future of synthetic biology is to educate the general public on the nature of the scientific field.  People must be informed before they make profound decisions regarding the safety and possible benefits of synthetic biology.
Since its inception in late 2013, UCSB iGEM has participated in many community science events.  We partnered with "I <3 Nano” exhibit at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, introducing a new station focusing on DNA and molecular biology.  During the event, the team helped young students extract DNA from strawberries and build double-helical DNA models.   In doing so, we were able to pique young students' interests in biology and genetics.  Through conversation, parents of the young visitors were able to ask UCSB iGEM members questions about genetic engineering.  And in many cases, team members were able to debunk common myths about the genetic engineering field.
The group also hosted a discussion forum for middle school and high school students at the Santa Barbara County Science Fair.  A large focus of the forum was a slide show presentation that gave examples of applied synthetic biology and genetic engineering.  The goal of the discussion was to inspire young students to learn more about this relatively new field of science. Many students were inspired and are planning to participate in IGEM's high school competition in the upcoming year.
