Safety in the laboratory is a priority concern for all members of the iGEM team Bordeaux, this track is to remind everyone of the importance of safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety or environmental safety.
</P><H3>The risks of Elasticoli</H3><P>

Our project utilize engineered bacteria to produce proteins with plastic and elastic properties. Despite the precautions taken , there is a risk for bacteria to escape from the laboratory and may be found in our environment.
The team Bordeaux are looking at potential problems that could cause the spread of these bacteria. </P><H3>
Resercher Safety</H3><P>
The team work in a laboratory at the Institut Européen de Chimie et de Biologie (IECB: http://www.iecb.u-bordeaux.fr) with Biosafety Containment Level One. We only use the Bacteria Escherichia coli DH5a and BL21 which are commonly employed in a basic microbiology laboratory. Very low risk, not associated with causing disease in humans.</P><P>We are aware of specificities related to the IECB thanks to personal protection and safety training.
We are required to wear long pants, closed shoes, lab coat and long hair must be tied back. In every lab we work in at the IECB a fire extinguisher, emergency shower, eye wash station and first aid kit is readily available. Before entering some lab it is necessary to wear gloves to avoid contaminations. </P><P>
However there are some hazardous chemicals we need for our project
Ethidium Bromide: Harmful on contact when ingested or inhaled, is an irritant of the skin and eye. In the long term exposure can have carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects, and can cause developmental toxicity.
A part of the laboratory is bounded using red tape to identify contaminated areas.
Polyethyleneimine: May be harmful if inhaled. Causes respiratory tract irritation. May be harmful if absorbed through skin. Causes skin irritation. Causes eye irritation. May be harmful if swallowed.</P><P>
For our project this year we are working with competent E. Coli to produce proteins. In the production lab we carried bacterial cultures. For extraction cells are lysed while using the sonicator helmet is mandatory. Then proteins are extracted by successive centrifugations. Each time, waste potentially containing bacteria are treated with bleach. </P><P>
However for the case where the E.coli is able to contaminate other areas, UV light is used to kill any remaining debris and organisms in tools before the use in the lab.</P><P><CENTER><I>We strictly follow the protocol and avoid careless operation.</I></CENTER></P><H3>Public Safety</H3><P>
Experimenters are careful not to release any parts to the public even though our designs presents no safety issue if released by design or accident. However, we are conscious that as any bacterium, E.coli can be hazardous. For instance, all traumatic wounds, infected burns and any serious lesions can potentially be contaminated, but it is very rare. E.coli can be treated with standard antibiotics.</P><P>
Public safety is ensured, as no member of the public is permitted access within the labs unless approved by the director of IECB, and team members followed all necessary procedures like washing their hands with disinfectant before leaving the laboratory to avoid transmitting potentially harmful material to the public/environment.</P><H3>Environment Safety</H3><P>
The equipment in contact with the bacteria are thoroughly cleaned with bleach to destroy bacteria before disposal. 
Although it is unlikely that the bacteria survive outside their culture medium and after treatment with bleach, we assume that there is a risk of environmental contamination. 
It is generally supposed that E. Coli would be flooded by natural strains once it is outside of lab though any genetically engineered bacteria can be potentially dangerous if released in the environment. </P><P>
During the work, we protected the environment from waste contaminations by using biohazard container for all biological waste such as bacteria and special containers for chemical waste. 
All labware and tools are autoclaved before use. 
Team members learned molecular biology skills and aseptic techniques. Team members followed all the necessary procedures, such as washing hands with disinfectant before leaving the lab to prevent transmission of potentially harmful material for the public / environment.</P><H3>They are talking about Health and Safety…</H3><P>
