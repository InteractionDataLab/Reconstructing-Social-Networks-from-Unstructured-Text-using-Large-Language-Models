MAP of ELP-RLP in pSB1C3. The final assembling could not be performed because we did not have the time to do it.
The ELP presents specific properties: it precipitates at high temperature. This property can be used for thermal cycling purification for instance. By successive cycles of temperature, ELP can be purified from a mix of proteins. This special property has been used to create a composite part for the iGEM registry. It is a proof of concept of the use of this part as a tool for protein purification by fusing ELP to another protein. The protein used as an example is RFP, to ease vizualisation of the process.
This part is a composite part made of BBa_K1317003 and BBa_E1010 (highly engineered RFP)
