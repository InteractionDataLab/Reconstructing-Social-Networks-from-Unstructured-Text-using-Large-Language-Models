Molecular biology
We do a new PCR of VPGXG-20, VPGXG-40 and VPGXG-60 with new primers
Digestion, ligation and transformation of pSB1C3 with our inserts VPGXG-20, VPGXG-40 and VPGXG-60
Making new ampicillin aliquots : (100 mg/mL)
Dissolve 1 g of sodium ampicillin in sufficient H2O to make a final volume of 10 mL. If sterilization is required, prewash a 0.45- or 0.22-μm sterile filter by drawing through 50-100 mL of H2O. Then pass the ampicillin solution through the washed filter. Store the ampicillin in aliquots at -20°C for 1 year.
