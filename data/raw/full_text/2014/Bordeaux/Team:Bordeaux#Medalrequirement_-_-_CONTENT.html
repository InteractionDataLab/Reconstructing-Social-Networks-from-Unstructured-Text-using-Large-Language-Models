- Team registration <SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; OK</SPAN>
- Complete Judging form <SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; OK</SPAN>
- Team Wiki <SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; OK</SPAN>
- Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree  <SPAN style="color:#00FF00"><STRONG>=&gt; Planned</STRONG></SPAN>
- The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services <SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; OK</SPAN>
- Document at least one new standard BioBrickPart or Device used in the project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry <SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; We provided the registry with three new synthetic genes (BBa_K1317001, BBa_K1317002, BBa_K1317003)</SPAN></P><H1>SILVER</H1><P>
- Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected <SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; We sucessfully tested the functioning our part Bba_K1317003 with several experiments (production of the polymer, purification, testing in downstream processes with physico-chemical characterization (wet-spinning, mass spectrometry…). Our parts has also been sequenced</SPAN>

- Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry <SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; Bba_K1317003 was well documented, all the data is available in the registry and on our wiki</SPAN>

- Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry <SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; Our parts have been received by the iGEM registry</SPAN>

- iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted. 
<SPAN style="color:#00FF00">
=&gt; We successfully talked about this project by getting it known to a large audience, thanks to media (journal, TV news, radio, social networks). It allows us to discuss with many people about synthetic biology and sustainable methods to replace heavy chemical processes that use petrol</SPAN></P><H1>GOLD </H1><P>

- The growth of the Registry depends on having a broad base of reliable parts. This is why the improvement of an existing part is just as important as the creation and documentation of a new part. An &quot;improvement&quot; is anything that improves the functionality and ease-of-use of a part, so that it is more likely to be used by the community. &quot;Characterization&quot; is a measurement of a functional parameter of a part, preferably in absolute units, that can precisely and repeatably be performed in other labs. <SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; We successfully improved the biobrick assembly method for fusion protein by using NheI restriction site
=&gt; We successfully improved the biobrick BBa_E1010 (RFP reporter) by using our part BBa_K1317003 in a composite BBa_K1317004, allowing a rapid, easy and column-free purification method for RFP.</SPAN>

- Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution <SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; We were involved in the French meet-up organized with four other teams (Paris_Bettencourt, Paris_Saclay, Paris_Evry and INSA_Lyon). <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Paris_Saclay/Project/Workshop" class="external text" rel="nofollow">(Link)</A>          
=&gt; We collaborated with the iGEM team of Bettencourt with their project of collecting sweat samples. <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Paris_Bettencourt/Collaboration" class="external text" rel="nofollow">(Link)</A></SPAN>


- iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, Describe ,Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy &amp; Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.<SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; We were highly participating in making the team and synthetic biology known with a wide audience<SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; We developed a board game about synthetic biology<SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; We are present in different medias (Radio, Social Networks, Journals, TV News)<SPAN style="color:#00FF00">=&gt; We communicated with the audience, explaining the project and its sustainability for the future, and debating about its potential importance in replacing petrol-based materials</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
