From 2014.igem.org
We had the idea to add a new restriction site compatible with XbaI before the stop codon. This restriction site is NheI and allowed us to produce a fused protein if the 2 inserts were cloned together following this protocol:
Other advantages of NheI:
heated-deactivation
compatibility with most of the others Biobricks (RFC10, 21, 23, 25, 1000)
obtaining a fused protein and allowing to choose the order of the genes
Disadvantages of NheI:
Not compatible with RFC12 standard
