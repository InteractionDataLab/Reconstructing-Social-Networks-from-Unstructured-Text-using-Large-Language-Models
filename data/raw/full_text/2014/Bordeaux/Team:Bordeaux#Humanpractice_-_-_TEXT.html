From 2014.igem.org
Human practice was an essential part of our project. During this year, each week, we worked on team communication and sponsoring request from companies or acquiring help. By sending almost 300 emails to a lot of companies with or without a main activity in biopolymers, we have drawn the attention of some them and earn about one half of our estimated budget.
Essentially, we communicated by social networks such as Facebook and Twitter (images des logos et des pages, prenez au pire sur ce que j’ai fait pour le poster), posting some photos and actualities subjects about the team. Also we were solicited by famous newspapers and TV news :
iGEM Bordeaux has worked a lot on it mediatization. So, it participated to a lot of interviews from different regional and national media such as:
Thanks to our crescent notoriety, iGEM Bordeaux’s team had the great pleasure to discover a web article on the official site of the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology of Bordeaux where the team was received during all this adventure for its weekly meetings and its manipulations in laboratory during summer.
We had the idea to involve people in our project with a crowdfunding project on Indiegogo. The purpose was to sensibilize people about synthetic biology and our project about another alternatives of petroleum chemical to make some new bioplastics thanks to bacteria. Explaining our project with a singular manner, and proposing some counterparts such as t-shirts, mugs or simply our gratitude on our social networks, this crowdfunding campaign allowed us to earn 11% of our initial solicitation.
Finally, we tried to show, towards teenagers and people who do not have specific knowledge in sciences, the synthetic biology field and the iGEM competition thanks to our board game called « The iGAME », with the goal to elaborate an iGEM project by winning biobricks when questions about biology were answered correctly.
We wish to thanks all of our sponsors, communication supports and people who trust us on Elasticoli project.
