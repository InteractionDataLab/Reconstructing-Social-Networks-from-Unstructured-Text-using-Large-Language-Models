This is why our team required the help of others specialist in different domains.
The work lab was done by 10 members of the Igem Bordeaux team 2014 during the summer, we were subdivised into groups and each one was responsible for a particular task.


The students developed the project during several brainstorming sessions at the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology.
All of the designs, constructs, and experiments presented in this Wiki were performed by the students of the team.
The instructors and advisors were providing feedbacks and advice, when it was needed.</P><H1>Advisors and supervisors</H1><P><B>Denis DUPUY, PhD</B>
Denis is a group leader at the European Insitute of Chemistry and Biology (U869 - Inserm) and works on post-transcriptional regulation in <I>C.elegans</I>.
He supervises the iGEM team of Bordeaux for the 3rd year. His involvement allowed the team to work in his lab where most of the labwork has been done. 
At his side, we all came up with the idea of the « elasticoli » project.</P><P><B>Elisabeth GARANGER, PhD</B>
Elisabeth is a group leader at the European Insitute of Chemistry and Biology (LCPO - CNRS) and works on Peptide-based polymer assemblies. She was present every time to advise the team about Elastin Like Peptid synthesis and let us use different machines and solvents.</P><P><B>Marie Beurton-Aimar, PhD</B>
Lecturer at université de Bordeaux and reasearcher at the Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en Informatique. She was in charge of the Bio-informatics group.</P><H1 align="center">Host lab</H1><P>

  Bordeaux IGEM team was hosted at the European Institute of Chemistry and Biology(IECB), which allows many scientist to share and develop their projects. It is a multi-disciplinary institute focused on biology, chemistry &amp; informatics.

Several labs hosted in the IECB provided us all the machines necessary for microbiology and molecular biology such as centrifuges, thermocyclers, sterile hoods, freezers, incubators, microscopes, plate readers, glassware, spectrophotometer and so on. We were in charge of taking care of the stocks as well as ordering lab consumables such as gloves, plates, pipettes, tips, and tubes as well as chemicals and DNA.</P><P><B>Bertrand GARBAY (EA4135) :</B>
Professor and researcher in the University of Bordeaux, he allowed our team to manage the construction of recombinant DNA coding for the ELPs and the production of these proteins. This work is based on Bertrand GARBAY (EA4135) 
and Laure BATAILLE (LCPO/IECB) research.</P><P><B>Sebastien Fribourg’s Group :</B>
This group works on structural biology, the group leader let us use the sonicator to lyse our cultures before centrifugation, their different centrifuges and materials for protein production were very helpful.</P><P><B>Lionel Beaurepaire :</B>
Lionel Beaurepaire is a research engineer he advised us on the production and purification protocol, in order to get more product. he was very helpful for us, he is the boss of production proteins</P><P><B>Axel Innis group :</B>
The group led by Axel Innis (PhD) work on translational regulation of gene expression, Axel authorized us to use his lab equipment.</P><P>&quot;The German Power&quot; <B>Carolin SEEFELDT</B> (Graduate student) and <B>Britta SEIP</B> (Post-doc) gave us a lot of helpful advices about protein precipitation.
Our nighbours from the lab near to us, helped us by lending us an incubator, some tips, centrifuge and giving us some piece of advice about electrophoresis.</P><P><B> Martin Teichmann group:</B> 
He is a professor at the University of and a researcher at the IECB. His work is based on Gene regulation &amp; tumor research.</P><P><B>CRPP</B>
For the transformation of our proteins into threads we collaborated with the Centre de Recherche Paul Pascal, which is located in the same campus as our lab.
We heard about their work on a TV report. We met two scientists there who helped us to elaborate a succesfull way to form our fiber.
The CRPP allowed to us to transform our proteins from liquid state to fiber, we characterized our product by using a machine allowing measurement of elasticity and resistance of polymers.</P><P><STRONG>Wilfrid Neri </STRONG>: 
Called “Spider Engineer” he is a chemistry Engineer (ITA CNRS) and works on production of nanocarbone fiber which could replace Kevlar one day !</P><P><STRONG>Cecile Zakri</STRONG> : Professor at Bordeaux University , and researcher at CRPP on nanotubes and graphene.</P><H1>External organisms</H1><P><STRONG>GenScript</STRONG>
GenScript sponsored us by offering us a synthesis. In parallel of our own synthesis, we asked them to synthesize two of our coding sequences (for BBa_K1317001 and BBa_K1317002).
We used these sequences to assemble the biobricks because it was sequenced, and so we could provide the registry with the proper sequence without mutations.</P></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
