Team:Bordeaux/Results/Purification
From 2014.igem.org
Cells are lysed and the protein mixture is collected. The ELP is purified by ITC (inverse transition cycling)
Method overview:
- 2ml of polyethylenimine is added to the lysate, the mixture is centrifuged at 14,000rpm for 15min at 4°C.
- The supernatant is saved and brought to room temperature. NaCl (1 to 3M) is added while homogenising the solution.
- The mixture is then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15min at 37°C.
- Supernatent is discarded and pellet is resuspended with 2ml of cold PBS.
- First and second steps are repeated but NaCl 5M is added so the ELP precipitate.
- Third and fourth steps are repeated.
- A final centrifugation is performed at 4°C for 10min (14,000rpm)
- The solution is dialysed and the samples (pure protein) are lyophilized.
