Welcome !
Our iGEM project is integrated in the professionals projects of the participating students. This competition dives us in the heart of research, from exploring an idea to the conception of an ingenious and original project, allowing us to optimise our knowledge in biology and an interdisciplinary opening in this field. Our work is realised in autonomy within Biology and Chemistry European Institute, under the responsability of dedicated and qualified researchers and supervisors in adapted infrastructures.
