From 2014.igem.org
Project presentation:
Earlier this year we spoke about plastics and we agreed that plastics are useful for many reasons, they’re durable, flexible and can be molded. But plastics also are problems because of the destruction of ecosystems, pollution of some natural resources, and the reduction of dump area.
So we tried to make E.Coli produce elastic proteins, and this is our ELASTICOLI project.
We selected 3 elastic proteins, the elastin from mammals, the resilin from insects and the dragline silks from spiders.  The elastin is responsible for the elasticity of the skin and the muscles. The resilin allow insects to jump or pivot their wings efficiently to fly. Finally the dragline silk allow spiders to dangle because of the high tensile strength and extensibility.
