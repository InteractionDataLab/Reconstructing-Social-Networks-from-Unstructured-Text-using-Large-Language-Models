Molecular biology
We obtain three ELPs strains streaked on LB medium
A strain of ELP VPGXG-20
Strain A : pUC19-New-Met20 in NEB 5-alpha F'Iq Competent E. coli
Used for cloning or others
AmpR
A strain of ELP VPGXG-40
Strain B : pUC19-New-Met40 in Stbl3 E.coli (The Stbl3 E. coli strain is derived from the HB101 E. coli strain and is recommended for use when cloning unstable inserts such as lentiviral DNA containing direct repeats)
Used for cloning or others
AmpR
A strain of ELP VPGXG-60
Strain C : pUC19-GS60 in Stbl3 E.coli
Used for cloning or others
AmpR
Inoculation of 3 LB medium for store
Transformation by electroporation of our bacteria with low copy IGEM backbone pSB6A1(2014 Kit Plate 4, well 2L)
Production
We use BL21 E.coli for the production
