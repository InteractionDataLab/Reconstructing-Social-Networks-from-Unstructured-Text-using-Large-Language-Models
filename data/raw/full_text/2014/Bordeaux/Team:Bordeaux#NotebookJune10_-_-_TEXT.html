Molecular biology
We continue our experiments to have BL21 without plasmid.
Preparation of  LB + Amp and LB + Chlo plates.
Production
A600 preculture VPGXG-20 = 2,460 A600 preculture VPGXG-40 = 2,678 -> Culture of  VPGXG-20 and VPGXG-40 at 37°C
T=0, A600 VPGXG-20 = 0,139
A600 VPGXG-40 = 0,072
-> IPTG induction when A600 = 0,8 and culture at 25°C
Purification
Protocol :
Collection of cell lysate
Pour ELP cultures into 1L plastic centrifuge bottles
Centrifuge 15min at 3,000 rpm and 4°C
Discard supernatant into 4L flask and bleach before disposal in the sink
Repeat the latter steps if desired to consolidate cultures
Resuspend cell pellet in 20mL PBS
Transfer cell solution to a 50mL Falcon tube for sonication
Lyse cells by sonication on ice (3min: 10s on / 20s off – let sit on ice then repeat for a total of 2 sonication cycles)
Transfer lysate into clear centrifuge tubes
ELP purification by Inverse Transition Cycling (ITC)
Add 10% polyethylenimine (PEI) (2mL per 1L culture) and gently mix
Centrifuge at 4°C and 14,000 rpm for 15min
Decant supernatant into clean centrifuge tube and discard pellet
Allow solution to warm, add NaCl  (not exceeding 3M) and gently mix       - The solution should turn turbid with the ELP transition
Centrifuge immediately after the ELP transition at room temperature and 14,000 rpm for 15min (HOT SPIN 1)
Discard supernatant and resuspend ELP pellet in cold PBS(2mL per 1L culture)
Transfer solution to 1.5mL labeled micro-centrifuge tubes
Put tubes on ice 30min
Centrifuge at 4°C and 14,000rpm for 10min (COLD SPIN 1)
Decant or pipette supernatant into clear micro-centrifuges tube and discard pellet
Allow the solution to warm and if necessary add 5M NaCl solution until ELP transition occurs
Centrifuge at 37°C and 14,000rpm for 10min (HOT SPIN X)
Discard supernatant, add cold buffer, and resuspend pellet
Centrifuge at 4°C and 14,000rpm for 10min (COLD SPIN X)
Decant or pipette supernatant into clear centrifuge tube and discard pellet
Perform 3-5 rounds of ITC purification
Today we stop protocol after resuspend cell pellet in 20mL PBS and store at -80°C.
