Team:Bordeaux/Results
From 2014.igem.org
Production (click for more info)
We managed to settle the best conditions to produce the biopolymers in maximal amount. Different medium and production time were tested and a special BL21 strain was used.
Purification (click for more info)
The special properties of the ELP were used to purify the produced proteins by inverse thermal cycling (ITC), which is a quick, easy and column-free method for purification of this polymer
Characterization (click for more info)
Characterization was performed according to different physical and chemical methods. As the protein produced is a polymer, it was transformed into a fiber and its resistance and elasticity have been tested.
