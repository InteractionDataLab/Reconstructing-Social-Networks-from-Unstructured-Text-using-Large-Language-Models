We need BL21 E.coli without plasmid for have new competent BL21
We try a non-selective culture with our bacteria.
Plasmid extraction by QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit from QIAGEN of our ELPs.
Digestion by BamH1 and EcoR1, ligation and transformation by electroporation and by heat shock of our bacteria with low copy IGEM backbone pSB1C3 (2014 Kit Plate 4, well 4B)
Transformation by heat shock
Plate of LB and pSB1C3
Plate of LB + Chlo and pSB1C3
Plate of LB + Chlo without DNA
