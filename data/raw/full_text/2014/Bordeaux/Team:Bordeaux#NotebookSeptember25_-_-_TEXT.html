ELP characterization
Test of polymere formation
To get the thread of polymers we have tested in different polymers we observed the following results :
- Sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) to 320g / L fiber => a fluffy appearance that does not take.
- Diethyl ether (C2H5) 2O => no reaction because the drop is trapped we are finding that the solvent is immiscible.
- Acetone (CH3COCH3) =>we observe the formation of a white ring.
- Sodium chloride (NaCl 5M) hot => observation of a white cloud, which is due to a problem of cohesiveness.
- Calcium chloride (CaCl2 15%) => we do a mixture of 1.25% alginate and ELP 40 (10 mg / ml) => fiber forming a perfect white.
NB: test 0.75% of alginate PERFECT!
Test of transition
After obtaining the fiber ELP 40 it is necessary to wash with hot water and extract; fiber may dissolve cold.
- The control is transparent
- The fiber changes color on contact at room Temperature, passing from white to transparent
With the mixture Alginate ELP 40 + (10mg / L) we can observe the formation of the polymer and we can infer that :
- In the presence of salt = the product disintegrates
- In contact with water this contracts = warm
Wetspenning
Mechanical test :
The traction machine can measure the degree of resistance to the breakage of any material.
This experiment involves placing a small bar of the material to be studied between the jaws of a tensile testing machine that draws on the bar until it breaks. Elongation was recorded and the force applied, which is then converted into stress and strain.
Mechanical traction device
The mechanical tests allow us to say :
- Alginate is reproducible but ends up breaking after a time t
- Alginate breaks faster due to the fact that it was realized hot
- We see a similar pattern, just an anomaly on the curve of a slip of paper without doubts.
- Elasticity similar to that of Carbon nano which is due to the presence of polymers, so we have a very obvious ELP particular feature.
- Fragile fibers that break easily
Sample 10mg
Breaks quickly because there MAYBE too much material, so the sample 2-3, 10-1 are not taken into account for the results!
2nd mechanical tests
Different samples of ELP
Sample 1.2 = with more alginate  we don’t notice anything important, it breaks fast
1.1 => resisted longer before breaking but there is an anomaly that is the glue that gives this end there
1.1 B => Strange results due to different conditions of drying?
