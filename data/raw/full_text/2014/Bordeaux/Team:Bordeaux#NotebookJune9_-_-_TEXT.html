Molecular biology
We continue our experiments to have BL21 without plasmid.
Preparation of  LB + Amp and LB + Chlo plates.
Production
Protocol :
ELP VPGXG-20 and VPGXG-40
Take a single colony and inoculate 250 mL LB + Amp at 37°C overnight
Next morning, inoculate 1L LB + Yeast Extract (5 g/L) + Glycerol (1 g/L) + Amp (100 mg/L) in order to have A600: 0.2. We can use Terrific Broth instead of LB.
Grow cells until A600 : 0.7-0.9
Take out 10 mL of culture, centrifuge 5min at 14,000 rpm and 4°C, discard supernatant and store pellet at -20°C (this is the uninduced time point).
Add 1mM (final concentration) of IPTG
After adding 1mM IPTG, re-incubate remaining cultures at 25°C shaking with 180rpm during 21h.
Collect 1ml fraction for the A600 (at t=1h, t=2h, t=3h, t=4h, t=5h and t=21h after induction)
ELP VPGXG-60
Take a single colony and inoculate 250 mL LB + Amp at 37°C overnight
Next morning, inoculate 1L LB + Yeast Extract (5 g/L) + Glucose (1 g/L) + Amp (100 mg/L) in order to have A600: 0.2. We can use Terrific Broth instead of LB.
Grow cells until A600 : 0.7-0.9
Take out 10 mL of culture, centrifuge 5min at 14,000 rpm and 4°C, discard supernatant and store pellet at -20°C (this is the uninduced time point).
Add 1mM (final concentration) of IPTG
After adding 1mM IPTG, re-incubate remaining cultures at 25°C shaking with 180rpm during 21h.
Collect 1ml fraction for the A600 (at t=1h, t=2h, t=3h, t=4h, t=5h and t=21h after induction)
We do a 30mL preculture of LB + yeast extract 5g/L + 1 g/L glycerol + Amp of (VPGMG-20) and (VPGMG-40) at 37°C overnight.
