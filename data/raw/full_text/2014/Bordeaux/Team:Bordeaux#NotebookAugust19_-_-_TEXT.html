Molecular biology
Verification of our plasmid Miniprep  we haven’t any problems with the plasmid
Digestion of 1μg of insert
Ex : ELP = 460ng/μl
So 1μg (ELP) = 2,17μl
+ 7,83μl H2O
DNA
10μl
Xba1
0,5μl
Spe1
0,5μl
10X Buffer 4
5μl
H+O
qsp 50μl
Migration on agarose 1,5% gel (100V, 30min)
Test of pSB1C3 miniprep
Digestion : we want 1μg of plamisd
Ligation : [insert] = 6 [plasmid] => molar concentration
PCR: linearization of ELP-40
Molecular biology
Problem with our 1x500ml Erlenmeyer  bacteria grow slower than in 2x250ml erlen.
Preculture of ELP-60 in 2x250ml of TB+amp
Preculture of BL21 in 5ml of LB overnight
