Molecular biology
IPTG
Induction with 8ml IPTG
m=0,19g   qsp 8ml H2O for 1L
Oligos SLP
We try to synthesize SLP gene with oligos
Test with nanodrop :
[SLP1]=1036,6ng/µl
[SLP2]=1311,6ng/µl
[SLP3]=1430,3ng/µl
[SLP4]=1421,2ng/µl
[SLP5]=1494,5ng/µl
[SLP6]=1279,7ng/µl
[SLP7]=1515,8ng/µl
[SLP8]=541,4ng/µl
Protocol :
- Oligo (10ng)
- dNTP(1µl)
- mix enzyme (15µl)
We want a SLP concentration of 10ng/µl
We do a mix and put it at 50°C
Production
ELP-20, -40 and -60 in LB+glucose
Preculture inoculate the previous day
Purification
SDS-PAGE
10µl P2 + 10µl sample 2X   ->   5min at 85°C
6µl ladder
