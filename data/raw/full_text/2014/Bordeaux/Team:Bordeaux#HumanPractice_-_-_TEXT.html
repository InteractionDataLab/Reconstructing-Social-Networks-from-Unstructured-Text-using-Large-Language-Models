Let’s play to iGAME, the lab game realised by the iGEM team of Bordeaux !  When you start playing, a project is attributed to you. To make it completely, you’ll have to answer a few questions about biology (depending on your level of knowledge in the field). Playful, this game will make you discover the field of syntetic biology and also share it with friends !
For more informations on the game or to receive a copy, please contact us !
