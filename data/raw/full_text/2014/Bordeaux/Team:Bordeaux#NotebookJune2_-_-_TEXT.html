Molecular biology
We use DH5α E.coli for cloning and others manipulations
Terrific Broth : 1L
Deionized H2O
to 900 mL
Bactotryptone
12 g
Yeast extract
24 g
Glycerol 10%
4 mL
Shake until the solutes have dissolved and then sterilize by autoclaving for 20 min at 15 psi (1.05 kg/cm2) on liquid cycle. Allow the solution to cool to 60°C or less, and then add 100 mL of a sterile solution of 0.17 M KH2PO4, 0.72 M K2HPO4.
(This solution is made by dissolving 2.31 g of KH2PO4 and 12.54 g of K2HPO4 in 90 mL of H2O. After the salts have dissolved, adjust the volume of the solution to 100 mL with H2O and sterilize by autoclaving for 20 min at 15 psi [1.05 kg/cm2] on liquid cycle.)
SOB : 1L
2%
Bactotryptone
20g
0,5
Yeast Extract
5g
10mM
NaCl
2mL (5M stock)
2.5mM
KCl
2.5mL (1M stock)
10mM
MgCl2
10mL (1M stock)
10mM
MgSO4
10mL (1M stock)
pH media to 7 with NaOH, then autoclave.
Transformation Broth (TB): 1L
10 mM
Pipes
3.02 g
15 mM
CaCl2
2.21 g
250 mM
KCl
18.64 g
Mix Pipes, CaCl2 and KCl in 900mL of Millipore water. Add NaOH until pH 6.7 (Solution become uncolored). Add MnCl2 (See below), stir, adjust volume to 1L, then filter sterilize. Store at 4°C.
55 mM
MnCl2
10.89 g
DAY ONE : Grow 12 mL overnight culture of favorite strain of E.Coli in 2XTY (~LB) (We use a select gold Efficiency, which are comparable to DH5α according to Bioline). Make SOB and TB.
