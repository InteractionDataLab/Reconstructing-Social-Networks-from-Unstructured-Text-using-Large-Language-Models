SLP gene synthesis
We are going on another strategy as we have a problem when we add the fragments 56 with 78. We don’t have any migration or a really bad one. A hypothesis could be that the fragments stick together.
We are going to try by adding fragment by fragment.
Vtot = 50µL
2 tubes with 2AB +1, 45+ amorce 1,5 were prepared. One was put in the thermocycleur (2AB45°) and the other in the ice during this time (2AB45°°).
PCR Parameter:
92°C 1 min
35 cycles : 92°C 10s, Gradient 68°C delta 4°C : (2AB45°) (3) 67°C 30s ; (1, 67) (10) 69°C 30s , 72°C 10s
End at 4°C
