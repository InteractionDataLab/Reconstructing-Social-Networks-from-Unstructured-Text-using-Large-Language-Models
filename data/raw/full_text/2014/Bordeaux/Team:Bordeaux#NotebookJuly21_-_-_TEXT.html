SLP gene synthesis
We try by just adding the fragment 5 and we do a PCR in the same time (in order to avoid the equimolarity problem of the PCR fusion).
2 tubes prepared: one in the thermocycleur ° and the other not and without phusion °°
PCR Parameter:
98°C 5 min
35 cycles: 98°C 10s, 66°C 20s, 72°C 2min
Final extension 72°C 10min
