BBa_S05255: C0061:B0010
Construction intermediate.
BBa_K1421001: plux R+RBS+LacIM1+2TE
This device is comprised of plux R (BBa_R0062), RBS (BBa_B0034), lacIM1 (BBa_K082005) and 2 TE (BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012). The lux pR is a right promoter in the lux cassette of V. Fischeri, which gives weak constitutive expression while enhanced when binding to the complex of LuxR and AHL (acyl-homoserine lactone ). The LacIM1 is a LacI mutant, which can repress lac promoter. Thanks to the work of Tokyo_Tech 2010, it is confirmed that this mutant protein has a weaker function of repression to the lac promoter, compared to the wild type LacI.
BBa_K1421002: plux R+RBS+cI+2TE
This device is comprised of plux R (BBa_R0062), RBS (BBa_B0034), cI (Part:BBa_C0051) and 2 TE (BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012). The lux pR is a right promoter in the lux cassette of V. Fischeri, which gives weak constitutive expression while enhanced when binding to the complex of LuxR and AHL (acyl-homoserine lactone ). CI is from BBa_C0051 which is designed by Vinay S Mahajan, Brian Chow, Peter Carr, Voichita Marinescu and Alexander D. Wissner-Gross. The cI repressor from E. coli phage lambda is modified with an LVA tail for rapid degradation of the protein. It binds to the cI regulator.
BBa_K1421004:  pluxL+RBS+luxR+2TE
This device is comprised of pluxL (BBa_R0063), RBS (BBa_B0034), luxR (BBa_C0062) and 2 TE (BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012). Repressive protein LuxR in the lux cassette of V. Fischeri is controlled by the left promoter pluxL in the lux cassette of V. Fischeri.
BBa_K1421005:  pRPAI
In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris, there is a quorum-sensing system RPAI/RPAR, which is similar to the LUXI/LUXR system in V. Fischeri. RpaI is the acyl-HSL synthase to produce p-coumaroyl-HSL by using environmental p-coumaric acid. RPAR is a signal receptor with homology to fatty acyl-HSL receptors (such as LuxR) that responds to p-coumaroyl-HSL to regulate global gene expression including the promoter of RPAI, pRPAI.[1] In deed, there have already been numbers of quorum-sensing systems; usually, the signals of these systems are not unique and inter-influence the other. While, p-coumaroyl-HSL (pc-HSL), the signal of RPAI/RPAR system is unique to AHL. So, RPA system is independent on LUX system and a part of its homologies. This part, pRpaI, is the promoter of RPAI. It opens the expression of the gene behind and meanwhile, can be regulated by the complex RPAR/pc-HSL.

While, p-coumaroyl-HSL (pc-HSL), the signal of RPAI/RPAR system is unique to AHL. So, RPA system is independent on LUX system and a part of its homologies. This part RPAI is the coding region of protein RPAI, the acyl-HSL synthase to produce p-coumaroyl-HSL by using environmental p-coumaric acid.

While, p-coumaroyl-HSL (pc-HSL), the signal of RPAI/RPAR system is unique to AHL. So, RPA system is independent on LUX system and a part of its homologies. This part is comprised of promoter of RPAI and coding region of RPAI. To use this device, one should put 1mM p-coumarate in the plate and pc-HSL, the signal of RPA system, will be produced.

BBa_K1421008:  pCl+RBS+LacI+2TE
This device is comprised of pCI, RBS (BBa_B0034), lacI (BBa_I732100) and 2 TE (BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012).Protein LacI is controlled by the cI regulated promoter, pCI.
BBa_K1421009:  plac+RBS+RFP+luxI+2TE
This device is comprised of plac (BBa_R0010), RBS (BBa_B0034), RFP(BBa_E1010), luxI(BBa_C0061) and 2 TE (BBa_B0010 and BBa_B0012). Protein LuxI in the lux cassette of Vibrio. Fischeri and RFP is controlled by the promoter plac.
