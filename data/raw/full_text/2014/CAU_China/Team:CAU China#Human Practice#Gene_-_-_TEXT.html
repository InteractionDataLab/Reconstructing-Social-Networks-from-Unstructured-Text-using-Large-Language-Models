iGEM-Help with Gene
We believe it is not uncommon for iGEM teams to go through this: We read about a gene, a plasmid or a strain in publications, which is a perfect fit for, and is so much needed, in iGEM project. We reached out for help from the labs immediately, but received no response at all. This affects the progress of experiments, and also limits the source of innovation.
In order to solve this problem shared by many teams, we decided to build a mutual sharing platform called "iGEM-Help with Gene". The platform aims at posting information about plasmid requests and strain sharing information. We hope to make this platform acknowledged by iGEM organization, making it easier to invite more participants to help each other. It work like this:
1) Requests are posted online and realized by other teams. If any iGEM teams see the posts and have the access to the mentioned labs, they may offer help. For example, if students from CAU search for a strain from a THU lab, any THU team could help ask for it.
2) Requests are gathered by iGEM officials and send to relevant labs. This could help solve plentiful problems by many labs, all at a time.
Meanwhile, we realize that the success of this platform needs as many as possible teams to cooperate. Once the network is built, the platform would run much more efficiently. If possible, we also want to hand the information down to later iGEM teams in the future.
