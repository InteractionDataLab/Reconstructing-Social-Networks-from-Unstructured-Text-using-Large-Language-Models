WELCOME TO CAU_China!
We are the team of China Agricultural University, CAU-China. For iGEM 2014, there are more than 20 members in our family and they spread from freshmen to juniors in CAU. It is the interest of synthetic biology and the ambition to propagate it that gathers us together. Though it is the second time for our team to take part in this amazing international competition,  for most of us, it is the first chance to directly join in the big event. This year, our idea creator, Mengni Wang, comes up with an idea named frozen by E.coli, intended to realize a dynamic pattern of snow flake with red fluorescence growing up from a point automatically with E.coli.  Since last year, we have accomplished a series of tasks, such as Human Practice, Journal Club every week, e-book edition, team construction and so on. As members of our team, we get great pleasure from the process, especially from the activity of brainstorm.
To be a better team, there is still a long way to go, but luckily, we are all  adamant about and enthusiastic at that.
Project descriptions
We move the frozen power from Disney to E.coli. We construct E.coli to express RFP to draw a dynamic pattern of snowflake. Once we kindle a spot, the pattern starts and grows up gradually. According to our design, two kinds of E.coli with partly different genetic pathway align alternatively. The two kinds of E.coli interact through two independent quorum sensing systems, LuxI/LuxR/AHL in vibrio fischeri and RpaI/RpaR/pC-HSL in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, while neither of them influencing themselves. A plate for E.coli culture is divided into rectangular grids and every “cell” in the grid is occupied with a colon of E.coli. On-state shows as red fluorescence while off-state shows as nothing illuminating. To kindle the system, we only need to add correspondent signal molecular to the central 4 colons of E.coli in a plate. Finally, there will be a snowflake with red fluorescence starts to grow up from a point automatically.1
