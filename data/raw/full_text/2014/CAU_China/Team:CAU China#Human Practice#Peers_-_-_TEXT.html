We usually discussed projects, rules of iGEM competition and Synthetic Biology with NJAU_China iGEM team, and gave some advice to them both on dry and wet experiments. When we knew NJAU_China iGEM team needed to synthesize a 2.4kb gene, gshF, which would cost over ￥7,000 ($1,200) through gene synthesis company, we provided a protocal which can direct people to synthsize gene with short single DNA oligotides (about 50-60 bp). The method mainly consists of single DNA oligotides designing and synthesizing by company, assembly, PCR amplification, transformation, check, sequencing and point mutaion( sometimes necessary). It takes similiar time length and 1/3-1/2 times less cost than synthesizing through company.
