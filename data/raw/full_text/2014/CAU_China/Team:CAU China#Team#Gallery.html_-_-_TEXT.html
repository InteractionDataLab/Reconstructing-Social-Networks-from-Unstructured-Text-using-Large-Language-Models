Wang Mengni
I major in the science of biology in Agriculture University as an undergraduate and take up Applied Mathematics as a second degree. I dream to study biological science with the help of the essence of mathematics and do something big of innovation and originality in science. I am enthusiastic at volunteering and work as the captain of volunteers of the college biological science in my university in 2013-2014. My hobbies are watching movies, painting ,playing badminton and chess. What distinguishes me most-smiling.
Li Chen
Li Chen, a student of Honors Class in CAU, majoring in life science. With a great interest in biology experiments, she started to learn experimental skills in a lab about genetics and molecular biology at the beginning of the sophomore year. At the meantime, she became an iGEMer of CAU. Swimming, singing and drawing are her hobbies for relaxing. She always believes that everything done is worthy.
Qin Peng
Qin Peng, or Roc, not freshman for iGEM’s work. Appreciate this chance to apply the learned from course and books, acquire lab skills, develop scientific mind, meet great people and get the passion to drive me. Love to work on things interests or excites me without self-control, which means ignore the cost of time and energy.Synthetic Biology is an excellent tool to win the great power for mankind. All for human.
Chen Li
Hi, guys, I am CHEN Li, a student from China Agriculture University. I am happy to be a member of CAU_China, and I learned a lot from the big game. I make some good friends in this game. No matter how hard problems we meet, I hope we can enjoy it and make it! Wish CAU and CAU_China a bright future! Let’s make it!
Wu You
Hi, my name is You and nice to see you. Maybe I’m a mix of Wendy, Dorothy, Anne and Alice from those cute storybooks so every day I discover more and more beautiful things. And books, pictures and other artworks are always on my mind. I’m responsible for the art related works and other interesting missions (e.g. asking questions) in our team. It’s a joy to work in our team since everyone wants this summer to be special and We Are Smart :D
Li Kai
I’m Likai, from College of Biology, China Agricultural University. This is my second year in CAU-iGEM-team. In the first year, I learned some useful experiment skills which were used for the project this year. After varies of mistakes in experiment, I have become a skillful senior in biobrick construction. Our team will be more diversification when the freshmen participating in and it will blossom as its members grow to maturity. Reading and sports is my favourite in spare time and these benefit me a lot. “Never focus on short-run profit” is my principle when I am working.
Guo Shuchen
Hi, I’m Shuchen Guo, from CAU igem team. I study biological science and I’m now a senior student. Having joined in CAU igem for two years, I have enjoyed a happy time with my teammates. Sharing our ideas during journal clubs are inspiring and doing some human public activities are really fun. And finally, wish our team a good luck!
Wang Ke
Hi, I’m Ke. It’s really fantastic to participate in this team. The meetings between members give me much inspiration and courage to seek for my interest on biology science. I like the brain storms to design our project, it’s somehow hard but fun. The ideas of IGEM attracts me a lot, and I enjoy every efforts I contributing to our team. Although we’ve met difficulties, surely we had got and will get over them with enthusiasm. It’s really nice to meet all of you.

I'm a junior student in the China Agricultural University. I major in biological science and minor in applied mathematics. I love math and logical thinking. I want to build mathematical models to apply to those magical phenomena in biology. Synthetic biology and Systematic biology must be useful and reliable in the near future.

Chen Qijun
I am Qi-Jun Chen, a faculty from China Agricultural University. I am happy to have the opportunity as one of advisors of CAU_China iGEM team. I learned a lot about iGEM from the team, and shared a variety of wonderful ideas. I hope to provide more and useful suggestions, as well as technical supports, for the team in the future.
Wang Na
CAU_China is a family. Everyone learns, thinks, discusses, and has fun in this family. I learn fresh ideas from all members. Most of the time, I feel like a happy student more than an instructor. And synthetic biology brings me so much surprise and fun. As a teacher, I hope students to explore more fields and pay more attention to the effects on life.  Synthetic biology can change the world! But I have so much regret in this year. I don’t have enough time to talk with team members. I don’t pay more attention to the latest advances. But I will not change the belief that we can make more beautiful life by synthetic biology!
