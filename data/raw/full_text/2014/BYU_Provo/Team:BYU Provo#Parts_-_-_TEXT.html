BBa_K1356000
Alpha Amylase with Signaling Sequence and PstI Site Removed
DNA in pSB1C3 plasmid backbone
Created by: Jordan Berg
Description
The Alpha Amylase for this part was taken from part BBa_K1195001. Attached to it is a DsbA signaling sequence required in order to express the gene product extracellularly in N. multiformis in the break down of biofilm in wastewater treatment plants. Additionally, the PstI site originally found in the BBa_K1195001 part was removed using site-directed mutagenesis. The restriction site was changed from "CTGCAG" to "CTCCAG" in order to remove this site. This gene is contained within the standard iGEM pSB1C3 plasmid backbone.
Amylase is an enzyme naturally synthesized by bacteria, such as E. coli, fungi, and even in humans in saliva and the pancreas. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of starches into sugars and breaks down the components of bacterial extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), which contains extracellular DNA, polysaccharides, and proteins. These components are a primary part of most bacterial biofilms and it is hoped that the enzyme being expressed extracellularly will allow for more biofilm break down so that
can more effectively breakdown wastewater components to make wastewater treatment plants more effective. It has been shown in other studies that amylase is an effective degrader of several other types of biofilms and we hope to show that it is equally effective at breaking down wastewater biofilm.
Design Notes
The DsbA signaling sequence was synthesized using RNA primers overlap-extension PCR owing it the signaling sequence's large size. The mutation to remove the iGem-illegal PstI site was done through mutagenic PCR.

LMD-9 CRISPR 3 System
DNA in pSB1C3 plasmid backbone
Created by: Garrett Jensen, Mike Abboud, Michail Linzey.
Description
This is the Type II CRISPR3 system taken from Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9. It is the Cas9, Csn1, Cas1, and Cas2 proteins along with the tracrRNA but . It may be used with a novel spacer/repeat region to target bacteriophage, plasmids, or any other form of incoming DNA. Cas9 is an endonuclease/exonuclease type protein and is the agent that inactivates incoming DNA. Csn1, Cas1, and Cas2 are involved in additional spacer acquisition, though the method is unknown. Cas9 can be directed by specially designed spacers or by spacers acquired by the CRISPR. The adaptive nature of the CRISPR3 makes it useful as an adaptive immune system for bacteria. It has been shown to be effective in a diverse range of microbes and can be used in any microbe.
Design Notes
This part has many restriction sites present. We have removed 3 EcoRI sites and 2 SpeI sites from this CRISPR so that it can be used with the iGEM plasmid. This CRISPR has also been engineered with a BamHI restriction site in the third spacer following the CRISPR protein set. This can be used to insert custom spacers into the existing spacer-repeat region.

Dispersin B with DsbA Signaling Sequence
Created by: Jared McOmber
Description
Dispersin B is a hydrolase protein that aids in the degradation of biofilms. This part contains the Dispersin B gene from part BBa_K1195000, with a signal sequence attached for export from the bacteria Nitrosospira Multiformis for the purpose of aiding in the breakup of biofilms in waste water management facilities.   A biofilm is a complex matrix composed of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and bacterial cells. They are generated as a defense mechanism by certain bacterial species. Although researchers have had difficulty isolating and identifying specific components of various biofilms it is generally accepted that biofilms are composed of: polysaccharides, proteins and extracellular DNA.   Dispersin B is an enzyme that targets polysaccharides in the matrix. It specifically targets "the glycosidic linkages of poly-β-1,6-GlcNAc" for hydrolysis (Itoh,Hinnebusch, Preston, & Romeo, 2005). N. multiformis is an amonia-oxidizing bacterium common to waste-water treatment facilities. Using NCBI we blasted it's genome for a signaling sequence found on the DsbA protein, common to E. Coli., and were able to find a match. The sequence will enable Dispersin to be exported from N. multiformis and act to degrade problematic biofilm in the reactors.
Design Notes
The DsbA signaling sequence was attached to the Dispersin B gene using PCR. Due to the length of the forward primer, overlap extension PCR was used to piece it together prior to attaching it to the Dispersin Gene.

The Dispersin B DNA was aquired from part BBa_K1195000. The signaling sequence was simply ordered along with our primers. Dispersin B was originally discovered in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a pathogenic bacteria which causes gum disease. The bacteria uses excreted Dispersin B protein to disperse it's own biofilm formations, and enable it to spread to other locations (Kaplan, Ragunath,Ramasubbu,& Fine, 2003).

These sequences were changed to CTTCAG and CTACAG, respectively, using site-specific mutagenesis; the mutant sites were verified to code for the same amino acids. Mutagenesis was also confirmed using 454 Pyrosequencing (BYU).
