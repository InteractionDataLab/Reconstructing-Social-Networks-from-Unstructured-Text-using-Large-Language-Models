Currently we are addressing some of the difficulties faced by the working microbial community in the bioreactor. These include: the buildup of biofilm, the destruction of the &quot;working class&quot; bacteria by phage, antibiotic discharge into the wastewater, and nitrate production. We will be building our machine in the bioreactor bacterium <I>N. multiformis</I> and optimizing it to address the aforementioned obstacles. </P><H1>Project: Antibiotic Breakdown</H1><H3>Project Background: </H3><P>In the current sewage treatment processes antibiotics present a serious problem to the downstream environment. Many of these and other similar chemical compounds, because they are not regulated or easily degraded, are being released into the environment at a growing rate. We identified the most commonly prescribed antibiotics and chose to address the breakdown of such antibiotics. We identified amoxicillin based and erythromycin based antibiotics among the most prevalent. The enzymes beta-lactamase and erethryomycin esterase B were identified as candidates for the breakdown of our antibiotics. We used the <I>EreB</I> gene from the iGEM parts database, and amplified the <I>Bla</I> gene from the iGEM plasmid pSB1A3.</P><H3>Antibiotic Breakdown Team:</H3><P>Bri Keele and Julie Roberts</P><H3>References:</H3><UL><LI>http://www.chrt.org/publications/price-of-care/issue-brief-2011-02-antibiotic-prescribing-and-use/</LI></UL><H1>Project: Biofilm Annihilation</H1><H3>Project Background: </H3><P>Biofilm production by bacteria is a major concern in activated sludge processors (ASPs). The buildup of these bacteria in these processors inhibits the helpful bacteria from being able to effectively break down several components. Of main concern are the biofilms of bacteria such as <I>Nocardia spp.</I>, <I>Thiothrix spp.</I>, <I>Sphaerotilus natans</I>, and several others. In order to solve this issue we cloned the genes for Alpha Amylase and DispersinB, both which break down the polysaccharide matrix of biofilms, as well as the gene for AiiA, a quorum-sensor blocker, into <I>Nitrosospira multiformis</I>, one of the helpful bacteria in the activated sludge processors. Attached to these genes in their respective chassis is a signaling sequence which dictates the expression of these gene products extracellularly. With the expression of these genes outside the cells there should be a significant decrease in the amount of biofilm buildup by these biofilm-creating bacteria and bacteria such as <I>N. multiformis</I> will be less restricted in breaking down the interested components of ASPs.

Between the high titer of bacteriophage found in sewage, prophage incorporated into its genome, and its natural slow rate of growth, <I>N. multiformis</I> does not reach high concentrations in bio-reactors(7). To combat the prevalence of bacteriophage infection we have cloned the CRISPR 3 system found in <I>Streptococcus thermophilus</I> LMD-9 into <I>N. multiformis</I>(6). Using a novel spacer region we will specifically target three prophage that reside in <I>N. multiformis</I>' genome. The CRISPR 3 system has been shown to acquire additional phage spacers and will provide adaptive immunity to <I>N. multiformis</I>(1).

Web. 1 Feb. 2014. <HTTP:>.</HTTP:></LI></UL><H1>Project: Denitrification</H1><H3>Project Background:</H3><P>Nitrification is the oxidative pathway that converts ammonia to nitrite and then nitrate. This process occurs naturally in sewage bioreactors due to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) like <I>N. multiformis</I> that thrive in regions of anaerobic conditions. Since ammonia is toxic to many aquatic and terrestrial lifeforms, AOBs play a critical role in cleaning wastewater by effectively removing the majority of the ammonia that enters the treatment facility. According to chemical analysis performed on the influent and effluent at the Silver Creek Water Reclamation Facility in Park City, Utah, ammonia enters the facility at a concentration of 34.0 mg/l and leaves at a concentration of 0.50 mg/l. These values display that current practices in sewage treatment are quite effective in ammonia removal, cleaning out about 99% of the ammonia deposited and produced in sewage. At the same time though, nitrate, the end product of ammonia oxidation, is released from these facilities at high concentrations. Although not as toxic as ammonia, nitrate also has harmful impacts on the environment including the acidification of waterways, unbalanced expansion of primary producers in the ecosystem causing eutrophication (see photograph below), and even growth and developmental challenges for several organisms. The chemical analysis of the effluent from the Silver Creek Water Reclamation Facility revealed that nitrate and nitrite, a less prevalent but even more toxic compound, entered the environment at an average concentration of 23.9 mg/l. This concentration of nitrate over doubles the limit set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for safe drinking water (10 mg/l) and is sufficient to retard the development of multiple species of freshwater fish, illustrating just how harmful this water actually is as it first enters the waterways.</P><P>To prevent eutrophication downstream from water treatment facilities, we have designed a plan to engineer <I>N. multiformis</I> to also perform denitrification, the process of converting nitrate into nitrogen gas, as a means of removing nitrogen without negative effects on the environment. According to scientific literature (see below), denitrification can be accomplished by the proteins coded by the <I>nirS</I>, <I>norB</I>, <I>norC</I>, and <I>nosZ</I> genes from <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> PAO1. These genes convert nitrite (NO<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>) to nitric oxide (NO), then to nitrous oxide (N<SUB>2</SUB>O), and finally to nitrogen gas (N<SUB>2</SUB>). The nitrification pathway in <I>N. multiformis</I> converts ammonia (NH<SUB>3</SUB>) to nitrite (NO<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>) and then to nitrate (NO<SUB>3</SUB><SUP>-</SUP>), meaning that the denitrification pathway begins with an intermediate of the nitrification process; a diagram of both pathways can be seen below. The enzyme in <I>N. multiformis</I> that converts nitrite to nitrate in nitrification performs a reversible reaction, so Le Chatelier's principle suggests that the denitrification pathway will work because equilibrium will drive the reaction to produce nitrogen gas. Knocking out the nitrate reductase in <I>N. multiformis</I> will also ensure that our chassis is forced to proceed through the denitrification pathway instead of producing nitrate.</P><H3>Denitrification Team:</H3><P>Cameron Sargent and Julie Roberts</P><H3>References: </H3><UL><LI>J.

As a precaution, we have engineered our chassis to be dependent on the environment found in the bioreactor, thus preventing it from escaping and spreading uncontrollably. We found that the amino acid serine is abundant in the water of the bioreactor and is not present in the effluent. We also found that the <I>serA</I> gene is essential to <I>Nitrosospira multiformis</I> production of serine. By removing the <I>serA</I> gene <I>Nitrosospira multiformis</I> will be unable to produce its own serine, which is essential for growth outside of the bioreactor.

As well, we were able to help those at the facility become more aware of more improvements of wastewater treatment of nitrates and antibiotics which we hoped to address with our engineered biological machine. They appreciated our ideas and the questions and concerns we were addressing.
