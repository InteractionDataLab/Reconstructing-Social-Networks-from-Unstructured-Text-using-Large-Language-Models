See acknowledgment page
6. Completed: At least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device Submitted to iGEM Registry:
BBa_K1396000: pSB1C3: 2XStrep_Flagtag_LL-37_Mussel Foot Protein_sfGFP
BBa_K1396001: pSB1C3: LL-37_MFP
BBa_K1396002: pSB1C3: MFP-sfGFP
BBa_K1396003: Mussel Foot Protein 1-5-1
7. Completed: Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
BBa_K1396000: pSB1C3: 2XStrep_Flagtag_LL-37_Mussel Foot Protein_sfGFP
BBa_K1396001: pSB1C3: LL-37_MFP
BBa_K1396002: pSB1C3: MFP-sfGFP
BBa_K1396003: Mussel Foot Protein 1-5-1
8. Completed: Submit the above parts to the iGEM Parts Registry.
9. Completed: Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.
See outreach page
10. Completed: Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year).
BBa_K1396001: improvement on Utah State biobrick which consists of only the LL-37 biobrick
11. Completed: Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Held a Skype conference with Utah State on October 24th, 2014 so that we could share our ideas with the Utah State iGEM Team and also hear about their project. Since our projects both involve use of antimicrobial peptides, we thought this would be a great way to provide feedback and suggestions for each of our projects.
Submitted a 50 mL Water Sample taken from Mill River in New Haven, CT,  to Cornell iGEM to help with their project goals.
12. Completed: iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights.
