Project Support and Advice
All iGEM team members, as well as advisors Natalie Ma and Dr. Farren Isaacs, participated in the formation of the idea for this project, and the research required to design and carry out this work.
Lab Work
Three undergraduates - Ariel Hernandez-Leyva, Stephanie Mao, and Yamini Naidu - performed the lab work over the summer, as well as part-time help from Alex Buhimschi. Natalie Ma, Adrian Haimovich, Alexis Rovner, Edward Barbieri, Ryan Gallagher, Jaymin Patel, and Miriam Amiram all provided assistance in the form of instruction of numerous new techniques and guidance on how to proceed, with Natalie Ma being our point person. Dr. Farren Isaacs, along with Natalie Ma, provided invaluable feedback and guidance. Dr. Kenneth Nelson trained and assisted us in the use of the FACS machine.

Modeling
Joel Sher carried out the theoretical model to determine the optimal time to induce E. coli to produce the maximum amount of peptide.
Wiki Design
This wiki was co-designed by Edward Kong, Ananth Punyala, and Cameron Yick.
Funding and Resources
Edward Kong handled all of the team's expenses, while Amy Mulholland helped us with our purchases. All of our sponsors, listed below, provided either direct funding or helped through other means, e.g. discounts on products or services, free samples, presentation feedback, etc. Yale West Campus gave us a lab space to work in, and the Isaacs lab gave us access to their materials and strains, most notably the E. coli EcNR2 strain designed for multiplex automated genome engineering.
