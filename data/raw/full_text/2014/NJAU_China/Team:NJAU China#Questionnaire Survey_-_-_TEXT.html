The analysis of the statistics
According to the statistics, we can see that the main audience of our exhibition are college students and most of them major in biology. Some of them had known something about synthetic biology before our exhibition through surfing the Internet、consulting related books and so on. However, most of them know little about it and the students majoring in other courses even know less. Through our event, 68 percent of them enhanced the understanding of iGEM and synthetic biology, 16 percent changed the view of biology and thought this field was practical and fun, 16 percent expressed that if given chance, they would like to participate in iGEM next year.
