We use the software to describe the whole idea of the experiment.Experiment was divided into three parts, and finally combined into two paths. The first part consists of copA promoter ,GFP, GshF and T7 promoter,enhancing Escherichia.coli sensitivity to copper ion. Glutathione can be synthesized by GshF, which can unifies both necessary reactions in one platform. The second part is a sgRNA-dCas9 system to enhance the efficiency of chelate cupric and cuprous by repressing the expression of copA. Finally, an automatically and efficiently copper-preventing guard are hoped to built. An overview of the biochemical process is shown in Figure 1. The figure is drawn with CellDesigner2 4.4.
he Fire HD 6 goes anywhere with its pocketable design–featuring a beautiful 6" HD display, 2x faster quad-core processor, and unsurpassed reliability in its class.                 Powerful quad-core processor up to 1.5 GHz                  The new quad-core processor consists of two high-performance 1.5 GHz cores and two lower-power 1.2 GHz cores running simultaneously for optimal load balancing and power efficiency. With over 2x the speed and over 3x the graphics performance of the previous generation Fire HD, the new quad-core processor ensures faster app launch times, smooth games and videos, and better overall performance.
