Here we express our heartfelt thanks to Yang Bo, Xu Yakui and other staff working in the Student Office in College of Life Science, for their selfless supports for our team, such as communicating with professors owning unique instrument, connecting outstanding students in the art and designing fields, and help us during the progress of negotiation with the corporation.
In addition, we express our gratitude to Peng Hairong for her outstanding techniques of designing posters for iGEM popularization (Human Practice).
Thanks to the help offered by Student’s Association for Science and Technology in Nanjing Agricultural University, we successfully exhibited our project, conception of synthetic biology and iGEM to people in China Pharmaceutical University and communicated with them over concerning topics.
Attributions:
Project:
Instructors’ attribution lied in the fund and room for our experiment, and sometimes they may ask about the situation of our project and deliver their professional ideas about it. In addition, instructors delivered lectures to us about the security in the lab. Moreover, they helped us contact other professors to borrow some special instruments.
Advisors helped us to get the hang of the usage of some complex instruments such as florescence microscope and microplate reader for ELISA .
Nearly whole project was designed by us students and we were responsible for most of the experiments with the exception of primer synthesis by Genewiz. Following are the responsibilities taken by students:
Wang Kun was in charge of the construction and functional verification of promoter vgb. Li Huiyu and Jiang Zhenxiong also participated in this project.  Xu Xuan was in charge of the selection and characteristic exploration of three copper inducible promoters or generators. Zhou Peng also participated in this project. Zhang Xuan was in charge of the design and construction of CRISPRi system. Wang Yicheng also participated in the project. Hou Xianglong was in charge of the construction and functional verification of GSH coding gene: gshF. With the help of CAU-China, he successfully got the correct sequence. Xia Xianyou was in charge of the exploration of minimum lethal cupric concentration. Wang Weiyi was in charge of the algae’s sensitivity for the cupric. Wang Ruoyu was in charge the data analysis and model construction for all the team. Jiang Rui also participated in this project. Sun Zhi was in charge of the experiment for iGEM popularization. He incubated Escherichia Coli with plasmid containing GFP and RFP expression module transferred. Jiang Zhenxiong was in charge of the security of project and the safety of operation in the lab . In addition, a great filter band model was come up by Wang Ruoyu.
Our thanks to:
Yang Bo, Xu Yakui and other staff in the student office helped us to contact professors who have special instruments.
Genewiz helped us with DNA synthesis service at a low price.
Policies and practices:
Zhou Jie was in charge of the iGEM exhibition inside and outside campus with the help of Student’s Association for Science and Technology in Nanjing Agricultural University who helped to contact students in other schools. Other teammates also joined this activity. Li Huiyu, Wang Kun, Wang Yicheng and Jiang Rui flied to Taiwan participating in the communication conference. Jiang Zhenxiong arranged a workshop activity along with the help of Li Huiyu. Other teammates participated in this activity. Zhou Jie was in charge of the questionnaire survey and other teammates participated in it.
Our thanks to:
Yang Bo helped us contact with departments in charge of the management of room for activity.
Genewiz helped us with financial aid for our exhibition, and provided us with team-shirts. Researcher Jiang Weihong in the key laboratory of synthetic biology(Chinese Academy of Sciences) helped us to clarify the usage of CRISPR-Cas system, and contact her partner to mail us a sample of gene cas9.
WHU-China helped us by mailing us a sample of dead cas9(Although some sites had mutated.) CAU-China helped us by offering us a protocol about synthesizing gshF gene.
Art and Website construction:
Xie Xiaoyu and Zhao Chaoran was in charge of the art design for our brochure, website and posters used in both exhibition and Giant Jamboree. Zhou Jie also participated in the art design on wiki.
Liang Feng was in charge of the design and construction of team wiki. Li Hui, Zhou Jie, Xu Xuan and Jiang Zhenxiong participated in the arrangement of wiki content.
Our thanks to:
Peng Hairong was invited and helped us with the poster for exhibition.
