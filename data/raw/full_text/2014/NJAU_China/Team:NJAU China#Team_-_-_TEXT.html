Advisors
Chen Xueting
Zhang Long
Zou Shenshen
Here we express our gratitude to the great support from the three advisors for their selflessly and nobly aids when students were caught in plight during experiment or were ignorant about the usage of some apparatus. In addition, thanks to their connection and communication with many professors can we successfully borrow some apparatus which is not open for undergraduate usually. Finally, we say "thanks" again for the room they left us to carry out many experiments.
Students
Li Huiyu
She is the team leader of NJAU_China who is in charge of the arranging all team work, ensuring all works effectively. In addition, she participated in the experiment about the part BBa_K1555003 and its data analysis. Moreover, she participated in the construction of our team wiki, and flied to Tai Wan join a communication conference held by National Chiao Tung University.
Xu Xuan
He is one of the core members of NJAU_China. The original idea of our project came from this intellectual guy. He participated in the design and construction of our CRISPRi system, selecting the most suitable biosensor part among three copper inducible promoters through experiments, and spent a lot of time helping others on experiments.
Jiang Zhenxiong
He is one of the core members of NJAU_China. This guy participated in the design of CRISPRi system and experiment about the part BBa_K1555003. Moreover, he was in charge of the communication and collaboration with sponsor Genewiz. In addition, he took the full responsibility for the Safety of our team. Finally, he participated in the construction of team wiki.
Wang Ruoyu
He is a key member for NJAU_China because he is the group leader of model construction. Besides, He also participated in data analysis. Moreover, he came up the idea of the safety module: utilizing the filter band to prevent our microbes escaping to outer environment.
Wang Kun
He is an important buddy in NJAU_China who was in charge of the construction of the composite part BBa_K1555003 and added a great number of data for promoter vgb which is one kind of basic part submitted by team ZJU-China in 2011. Besides, he joined the group flying to Tai Wan for a communication conference.
Zhang Xuan
She is an important teammate in NJAU_China who participated in the design of our facilitating system and was in charge of the construction of the it. Besides, she spent a lot of time on the iGEM popularization inside campus.
Hou Xianglong
He is an important guy of NJAU_China for his contribution to the construction of the most important coding gene gshF by himself. It was pretty common seeing him assisting others on the experiments.
Zhou Peng
He is an essential buddy of NJAU_China because he helped to choose the potential copper sensor and complete the most basic part: copper inducible promoter with Xu Xuan. And most of the experiment of this group was carried by him.
Xia Xianyou
This guy was in charge of the experiment designed for measuring the lowest lethal concentration of the cupric for E.Coli DH5α. And he helped to find and communicate with the participants responsible for wiki construction.
Zhou Jie
She is a key teammate of NJAU_China for her great contribution to the policies and practices. She was in charge of the communication and collaboration inside and outside campus and with the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shang Hai.
Jiang Rui
He is an important team member in charge of the model construction. And he contributed to our policies and practices by flying to Tai Wan for the 2014 iGEM Conference organized by National Chiao Tung University.
Wang Yicheng
She participated in the construction of facilitating module and helped others on experiment. And she flied to Tai Wan participating in the iGEM 2014 Conference as one of the representatives for our team.
Wang Weiyi
He is an important team member in NJAU_China because he designed and carried out experiment to prove the toxicity to algae. His experiment allows us to know the harm of cupric through naked eyes.
Sun Zhi
He is an important team member in NJAU_China. He participated in the experiment measuring the lowest lethal concentration of cupric for E.Coli DH5α. Moreover, he did well during the iGEM popularization inside campus. He was always willing to help others on experiment.
Xie Xiaoyu
He is one of the key team members for NJAU_China. He was in charge of the art work of the team wiki. This talented guy brilliantly designed and created the team logo and other pictures used on the wiki.
Liang Feng
He is one of the key team members for NJAU_China. He was in charge of the wiki design and wiki construction. This buddy showed his talent on website making.
Zhao Chaoran
She is an important team member for NJAU_China. She had shown her talent in the design of brochure used for iGEM popularization and poster used for Giant Jamboree.
