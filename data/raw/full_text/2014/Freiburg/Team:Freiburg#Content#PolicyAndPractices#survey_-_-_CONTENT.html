Although 56.6% declare to have an educational degree in the field of science, only 41.8% say that they know what synthetic biology is.

Figure 3 illustrates how consulted persons rate the risks that are associated with genetically modified organism. Risks that might harm the environment are perceived to be higher than risks concerning health aspects. Overall, risks are mainly ranked between ‘moderate’ and ‘high’.

				</P></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-6"><P><EM>Demand for more information about Synthetic Biology</EM></P><P>Despite all these concerns,  people generally express great interest for synthetic biology and wish to be informed about advantages and possible applications,  about ethical questions, such as who will benefit of new technologies and about financing. 
				</P><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><P class="header">Figure 4: Aspects concerning Synthetic Biology.</P><P class="desc"> When asked what aspects concerning synthetic biology people would like to learn more about, respondents were mainly interested in advantages, possible applications and in risks that might arise.

	</H2><P>It can be summarized, that there are significant concerns about safety and security issues in the population. However, people do see the potential of synthetic biology and show interest, especially regarding safety measures and novel applications. In general, people are open-minded and unbiased, which should be seized as an opportunity for gaining more acceptance by informing about safety measures and assuming more responsibility for biosafety aspects.
