Our Project
The AcCELLerator facilitates one central process in mammalian cell culture: Gene delivery.
It provides you the possibility to stably insert and express multiple genes with high spatio-temporal resolution. The two component system combines the advantages of optogentics and viral vector based gene delivery.

Results
To validate our system we used different experimental methods including FACS-analysis, immunoblotting and confocal microscopy.
