      During the first phase of our project we had fierce discussions about possible projects.
      Our members collected information about current research and did some brainstorming,
      resulting in long and interesting debates. In summary, we had a lot of fun in our
      finding phase. Yet most of us never competed in iGEM or even heard about it before,
      thus having no idea what iGEM is all about. Therefore, we examined previous
      iGEM projects of other teams as an inspiration. While we analyzed a lot of these projects,
      we noticed that by far most of the teams favor bacterial systems over mammalian cells
      for their projects. Especially <EM class="highlight-kursiv">Escherichia coli</EM> and
      <EM class="highlight-kursiv">Bacillus subtilis</EM> are the number one organisms in iGEM
      history, and this year’s competition will make no difference.  
    </P><P>
Mammalian cells can form multicellular patterns and are of much interest in clinical applications.      
So we asked ourselves: why are there so few iGEM teams working with mammalian cells?
      Why do most teams prefer to work with bacterial systems? And: <EM>can we develop a
      system that facilitates dealing with mammalian cells, so that more future iGEM teams 
      consider to work with mammalian cells?</EM></P></DIV><DIV class="col-sm-6"><FIGURE><FIGCAPTION><P class="header">Systems used at iGEM 2013.</P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row category-row"><DIV class="col-sm-6"><P>
      There are several obvious reasons for this: First, working with mammalian cell lines 
      is normally far more expensive than working with bacteria or algae and plants. That starts 
      with medium and goes on with special equipment and labs, which often are required. Next, 
      <EM class="highlight-kursiv">E. coli</EM> and <EM class="highlight-kursiv">B. subtilis</EM> 
      are the best described, categorized and established system in the iGEM competition. Finally,
      prokaryotic synthetic biology is right now the largest field of synthetic biology. Consequently
      many supervisors are specialists in prokaryotic methods, thus leading to a stronger
      focus on prokaryotic projects. 
    </P><P>
      However, another big problem is the time consuming and often complicated handling of
      mammalian cells. Particularly the generation of stable cell lines is a major obstacle for many teams. 
    </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row category-row"><DIV class="col-sm-6"><P><EM>But why is the generation of stable cell lines that necessary?</EM></P><P>
      For synthetic biology, controlled and sustained expression of multiple genes is
      usually required. In most cases, the different genes will be introduced into the target
      cell via several plasmids. Bacteria with sustained propagation of several different plasmids
      can be generated fast and easy, but transfections, the “normal” way to introduce plasmids
      into mammalian cells, suffer from lack of control over expression levels and the inability
      to introduce three or more plasmids at the same time.
    </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row category-row"><DIV class="col-sm-6"><P>
      Therefore, it is necessary for synthetic biology projects with mammalian cells to generate
      stable cell lines, where the genes of interest are stably integrated into the genome.
      Although this is possible with transfections and subsequent selection with antibiotics,
      it is very time consuming because only one gene can be introduced at a time, and integration
      events are very rare, leading to long times (weeks) of cell line expansion before the next step.
    </P><P>
      The solution to this problem is the generation of stable cell lines via viral transduction,
      where the gene of interest is stably integrated into the host genome. Due to the high efficiency
      of this process, the cells can be sorted very soon after gene transfer, and the resulting stable
      cell line is ready for the next step after only one week. In addition, the high efficiency
      of gene transfer makes the simultaneous introduction of several genes within a single step possible.
    </P><P>
      The most common viral system for transduction is the lentiviral system. However, due to
      its promiscuity to infect mammalian cells of many species (including humans), working with
      lentivirus requires an S2 biosafety standard. For some iGEM teams this may be just an
      additional inconvenience, but for others it can mean the end of the project. 
    </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row category-row"><DIV class="col-sm-6"><P>
      To overcome these limitations, our team searched for an alternative to the lentivirus
      that can be used under S1 biosafety standard. The requirements for this virus are:
      easy preparation, large cargo, high transduction efficiency, but a very high specificity
      towards a defined non-human cell type. After consulting with virus specialists we found
      a virus that perfectly suited our demands: the Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV).
    </P><P><EM>
      The MuLV offers the following great advantages:
      <UL type="disk"><LI>only infects murine cells</LI><LI>carries up to 8 kB of DNA</LI><LI>easy generation in Phoenix cells</LI><LI>high transduction efficiency</LI><LI>not patented</LI><LI>can be used with non-murine cells (!) after transfection of a single protein</LI></UL></EM></P><P>
      We, the iGEM team Freiburg 2014, established the MuLV for the iGEM community.
      We optimized the protocols for working with the MuLV and indeed generated stable cell 
      lines with several genes. For use by other teams,
      the Phoenix cell line can be obtained by ATCC, and the plasmid for virus production
      has been deposited as a backbone to the iGEM repository. Have fun cloning!
