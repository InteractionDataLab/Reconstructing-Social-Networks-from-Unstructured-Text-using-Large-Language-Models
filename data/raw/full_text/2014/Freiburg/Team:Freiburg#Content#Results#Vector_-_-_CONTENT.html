		Our viral vector derives from the murine leukemia virus and since this virus is a retrovirus, it stably integrates our gene of interest into the target genomes. Any gene of interest can be delivered. We transferred genes for different fluorescent proteins into murine cell lines (Fig. 1).
		</P><FIGURE class="fig-full-width"><FIGCAPTION><P class="header">Figure 1: Murine NIH3T3 cells infected with our viral vector</P><P class="desc">The vector contained different fluorescent markers: (A) EGFP, (B) mKO, (C) mKate that were stably integrated into the genome. <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Notebook/Labjournal#Mouse_colours">Labjournal</A></P></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE><P>
		In addition, we demonstrated the capability of stable gene integration by creating an EGFP cell line and assessing the fraction of fluorescent cells over several passages. Two days after virus infection, we selected for cells displaying green fluorescence by a cell sorter. Afterwards, we analyzed the EGFP cell line for several weeks by flow cytometry. Sustained expression of EGFP indicates stable integration into the genome of the original cell line (Fig. 2).

		For optimal integration of the target gene, we tested how long the viral vector need for transducing murine cells. We incubated murine cells (NIH3T3) with the virus for different time intervals, washed the virus away, and counted fluorescent cells after 48 h. A high transduction rate was already reached after incubating the cells for five hours with the viral particles (Fig. 3).

		To sort the cells that stably integrated the gene of interest into the genome, the viral vector contained a marker, e.g. the gene for a fluorescent protein. But for future experiments, an additional target gene would be placed into the virus cargo, separated from the marker by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) for selection or sorting. We tested the expression strength of EGFP in pMIG constructs containing only the marker in comparison to constructs containing the target gene upstream of an IRES and EGFP as a marker (Fig. 4). In the construct combining the target gene with the marker, EGFP expression is lower; a possible explanation is the lower rate of translation initiation by the IRES compared to the cap at the 5' end of the mRNA. If only the IRES but no additional target gene is present upstream of EGFP, expression of EGFP is high because the first ATG after the 5' end of the mRNA is the start codon of EGFP.

		</P><P>
		Protocols for virus production and target cell transduction were optimized. As producer cell line for viral particles we used Phoenix cells which stably express most of the viral genes. Before transfection with pMIG, the final plasmid to initiate virus production, we split the Phoenix cells several times to increase viability and push them into the exponential growth phase during production of the viral vector. In addition, supernatant containing the vector was harvested at distinct time points optimized for high viral titer. Target cells were infected by viral supernatant with polybrene which increases the probability for particles to reach their target cells. Since murine leukemia viruses only infect dividing cells, the phase of maximum division rate of the target cells was matched to the time point of infection. 
		</P><P>		
		Under these optimized conditions, the efficiency for transducing murine cell lines with our viral vector was over 80% (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Since we had only 16% transduction efficiency at the beginning of the project, we would consider this a significant advance. To our knowledge, an optimized infection protocol with murine leukemia virus has not been published to date. The exact procedure can be found here (<A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Freiburg/Notebook/Methods#Notebook-Methods-Cell-Culture-Virus-Production">Methods</A>).

Concentration was acheived by incubating the viral supernatant with hexadimethrine bromide (polybrene) as well as with chondroitin sulfate, leading to formation of complexes that were big enough for pelleting by centrifugation. Pellets contained the viral particles and were resuspended in a small volume of growth medium. Infecting murine cells with the concentrated vector lead to a higher transduction rate compared to the unconcentrated virus or the diluted virus (Fig. 7). 
			</P><P>In addition, we determined the decay curve of the viral particles. Incubation at 37°C leads to a strong decrease of the infection rate with a half time of approximately 6.5 hours (Fig. 8). This short half life provides an enhanced safety regarding work and handling of our viral vector.
