Link-It - Gaining Acceptance by Overcoming Fears
Link-It is our approach to reach out to the public and to address questions beyond the bench, which arise from our project. It describes the connection between public education and handling of biosafety issues.  We see concerns regarding safety risks as the main reason for scepticism among people towards new technologies. Hence we are convinced that gaining acceptance towards new scientific fields, such as synthetic biology, is only possible by assuming responsibility for biosafety and security, by responding to concerns and by educating about security measures. This will pave the way for trustful communication and unbiased debates about limitations and benefits of synthetic biology.
