BioBricks
On this page, you will find our new designed BioBricks and also our plasmids used in the experiments.
Here you can get an Overview of our BioBricks. If you want to see more details especially for certain BioBricks, you can click on the BioBrick definition and explore the registry entries.
BBa_K1470000 : mCAT-1
mCat-1 is the receptor we introduced to human cells to be able to infect them using the MuLV. The first of our favorite parts! :)
BBa_K1470001 : Puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (PAC)
Puromycin N-acetyl-transferase is an enzyme which we used for selecting stable eucaryotic cell lines. Because of the blocked protein biosynthesis more than 99% of uninfected cells will be dead within two days.
BBa_K1470002 : Galactose-induced gene 4 (Gal4BD)
Galactose-induced gene 4 (Gal4BD) is used to investigate gene expression levels.
BBa_K1470003 : Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element (WPRE)
Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element (WPRE) is a regulatory RNA sequence, which promotes viral gene expression.
BBa_K1470004 : Secreted Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP)
Secreted Alkaline Phosphatase (SEAP) is used in cell culture assays to quantify gene expression. The second of our favorite parts! :)
BBa_K1470005 : engineered PDZ domain (ePDZ)
engineered PDZ domain (ePDZ) is an important part of the blue light system.
BBa_K1470006 : The Viral Vector (pMIG)
The Viral Vector (pMIG) is the plasmid which is used to tranfect Phoenix cells with the gene to be packed into viral particles. It contains two LTRs and a multiple cloning site. The third of our favorite parts! :)
BBa_K1470007 : Cas9-Nickase
Cas9-Nickase is a Cas9 without iGEM restrction-sites but full catalytic activity.
Plasmids
mCat-1 Plasmids
Constitutive Expression
p14rz_003: pcDNA_SLC7A1_GFP
mCAT-1 fusion protein tagged with a C-terminal GFP (green fluorescent protein)
used for fluorescent imaging
p14rz_004: pcDNA_SLC7A1_HA
mCAT-1 fusion protein tagged with a C-terminal HA (hemagglutinin)
used for Western Blot studies
p14rz_005: pcDNA_SLC7A1_mCherry
mCAT-1 fusion protein tagged with a C-terminal mCherry fluorescent protein
used for fluorescent imaging
p14rz_006: pcDNA_SLC7A1_HA_p2a_mCherry
mCAT-1 tagged with a C-terminal HA and mCherry
the HA and the mCherry are separated by a P2A sequence that results in 2 separate proteins, mCAT-1-HA and mCherry
p14rz_007: pcDNA_SLC7A1_HA_mCherry
mCAT-1 tagged with a C-terminal HA and mCherry
the HA and the mCherry are linked by a GGSGGSGGSGGSGG-linker resulting in a doubled tagged mCAT-1 fusion protein
Red Light induced Gene Expression
p14rz_010: TetO13_CMVmin_SLC7A1_HA_p2a_mCherry
inducible vector encoding mCAT-1 fusion protein under control of a modified Tet promoter (Ptet) harboring a spacer between the 13mer tetO operator and the minimal promoter (TetO13–CMVmin)
the HA and the mCherry are separated by a P2A sequence that results in 2 separate proteins, mCAT-1-HA and mCherry
p14rz_011: TetO13_CMVmin_SLC7A1_HA_mCherry
inducible vector encoding mCAT-1 fusion protein under control of a modified Tet promoter (Ptet) harboring a spacer between the 13mer tetO operator and the minimal promoter (TetO13–CMVmin)
the HA and the mCherry are linked by a GGSGGSGGSGGSGG-linker resulting in a doubled tagged mCAT-1 fusion protein
Blue Light induced Gene Expression
p14rz_008: Gal4_SLC7A1
inducible expression vector encoding mCAT-1 under control of a galactose-inducible promoter (Gal4UAS)
in the dark the expression of mCAT-1 gene is off
to induce expression of the mCAT-1 gene the pKM292 + pKM297 plasmids are needed
p14rz_009: Gal4_SLC7A1_HA
inducible expression vector encoding the mCAT-1 fusion protein (tagged with a C-terminal HA) under control of a galactose-inducible promoter (Gal4UAS)
in the dark the expression of mCAT-1 gene is off
to induce expression of the mCAT-1 gene the pKM292 + pKM297 plasmids are needed
Light System
Blue Light
p14ls_002: Gal4_mCherry
inducible expression vector encoding the reporter gene mCherry under control of a galactose-inducible promoter (Gal4UAS)
in the dark the expression of the reporter gene is off
to induce expression of mCherry the pKM292 + pKM297 plasmids are needed
