Thawing of eukaryotic cells
New Phoenix cell stocks were thawed:
cryotube was thawed at 37°C water bath until almost defrosted
stock was filled in 9 ml warm completed growth medium and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 2 min
medium was removed and refilled with 10 ml warm completed growth medium
cells were seeded on 100 mm plates
Testing optimal cell density of mouse fibroblasts
NIH 3T3 have a really fast growth so that we tested the optimal cell number for seeding NIH 3T3 for having around 60% cell density on the next day. NIH 3T3 cells grow very fast; therefore we have tested the optimal seeding cell number to obtain 60% cell density on the next day. Results indicate that the optimal cell number is 1 &ndash 1.5x10^5 cells per well ( = 0.5 – 0.75 cells/ml)

Transduction mouse cells (different incubation times)
NIH 3T3 cells (60% density) were transduced with MuLV IRES EGFP and incubated for 8, 16, 24 and 2 x 8 hours. Virus was taken from different supernatants (an older one and a newer one) to see, if it makes any difference. Cells were infected with supernatant (500µl viral supernatant, 500µl completed growth medium + 1µl Polybrene/ml) harvested at different time points. Results indicate that there was no difference between older and newer virus; best results were given with an infection time of 2 x 8 hours.
For testing, if centrifugation brings better transduction efficiencies, mouse cells were infected with the different viral supernatants and centrifuged for 45 min, 1800 rpm, 32°C. In two wells it was tested if the double amount of Polybrene brings better transduction efficiencies. However, we found out that cells were death after centrifugation.

Cells were transfected via PEI in suspension (3 x 10^5 cells/ml, 100 µl transfection mix/ml, 1,5 µg DNA/ml). Cells were incubated for       5 h at 37°C before centrifugation (900 RPM, 3 min, 24°C). Cells were resuspended with fresh DMEM to a final concentration of 1,5 x 10^5 cells/ml) and seeded (0,5 ml/well).
Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°C and the illuminated with blue light for 1 h (not the dark control).
Cells were infected with 250 µl virus supernatant (+0,5 µl Polybrene) per well. Medium was changed after 4 h of incubation at 37°C.
After 24 h and after 48 h of incubation 200 µl supernatant was taken and used for SEAP assay as described before.
Since, SEAP is already produced by Phoenix cells during generation of viral particles, SEAP was detected in every negative control.

HEK cells were transfected with the blue light system (PKM292 and PKM297) and the light induced receptor (p14ls_003). The receptor was labeled with mCherry. Cells were infected with MuLV EGFP afterwards; (left) incubation in the dark, (middle) after illumination with blue light, (right) cells expressing the light induced receptor were infected with MuLV.

Figure 4: Generation of a QR code on a 384 well plate.
HEK293 cells were transfected with the blue light system (PKM292, PKM297) and light induced SEAP as reporter (PKM084). Single wells were covered with a photo mask to prevent cell from light exposure using a photo mask for a QR code (made by iGEM Team Aachen 2014). 24 hours after illumination with blue light a SEAP assay was performed leading to colour changing of wells containing SEAP. Only a part of the plate was used. (A) Photo mask for QR code generation, (B) Picture of the 384W plate after the SEAP assay, (C) the same plate with contrast of the colours increased at a computer.

Kinetik of the blue light induced receptor
HEK293 cells were transfected using PEI with the blue light system (PKM292 and PKM297) and the light induced receptor (p14ls_003). 24 hours after transfection cells were illuminated for 5 hours with blue light. At distinct time points (after 10h, 12h, 15h, 18h and 24h) cells were analysed with fluorescence microscopy and lysed with RIPA buffer for analysis with Western blot.
Kinetik of the blue light induced receptor.
HEK cells were transfected with the blue light system (PKM292 and PKM297) and the light induced receptor (p14ls_003, mCherry labeled receptor). Pictures were taken after 12h, 15h, 18h and 24h.

We detected fluorecence in all experiments.
The light induced receptor was induced by light scatter.
HEK293T cells were transfected with the light system and the light induced receptor (p14ls_003) labeled with mCherry. Cells were illuminated using a photo mask that covered parts of the cell culture and prevented them from light exposure. However, the receptor expression was activated also outside of the pattern.
