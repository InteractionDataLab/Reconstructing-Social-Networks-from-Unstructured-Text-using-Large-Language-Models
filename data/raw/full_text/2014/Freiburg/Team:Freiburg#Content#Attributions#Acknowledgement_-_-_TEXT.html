Ms. Dr. Nicole Gensch
We'd like to thank Ms. Dr. Nicole Gensch, head of BIOSS' Toolbox. The Toolbox is a BIOSS internal provider of plasmids, agar plates, buffer, LB media, cell lines or antibodies. She's one of our instructors and provided us always with knowledge and lab materials. Not alone she gave us great advices but had the creative idea for our logo! With her alert mind, she had a strong influence on our weekly meetings and lab methods.
Mr. Dr. Max Ulbrich
Max Ulbrich, head of AG Ulbrich at BIOSS, is our main source of advice. His proposals and critiques showed us many times, where we had to improve our experiments, what aspects were very important or in which direction the project should go on. Furthermore he used his connections to other university groups to get us plasmids or contact persons. As the lab time began he equiped us missing stuff. Later on he lent us almost everything what we had need of helped us in the lab.
Anne Müller, Patrick Gonschorek, Lisa Schmunk (AG Weber), Natalie Louis (AG Warscheid)
