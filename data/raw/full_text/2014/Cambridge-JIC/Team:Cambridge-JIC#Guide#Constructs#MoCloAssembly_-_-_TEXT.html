MoClo Assembly
For protocols and outline of MoClo, see "Engler et al.:A modular cloning toolbox for plant cloning or RFC 105 .
If using MoClo, it is recommended that you use the selection casette as the first of your level 1 parts.
After cloning into a level 1 construct, and amplifying the plasmid in E-Coli, it is suitable for direct electroporation into agrobacteria
Parts from other sources
If you're using Level 0 parts not from MoClo plasmids, you need to:
1. Make sure they don't have Bsa1, Bpi1 and BsmBI restriction sites
2. PCR Amplify them using primers:
Forward: AAAAGGTCTCANNNN_your_binding_forward_primer
Reverse: AAAAGGTCTCA[MMMM]'_your_binding_reverse_primer,
where NNNN denotes the according PlantSyntax/RFC105 code for the 5' end of the part, and [MMMM]' the reverse complement of the code for the 3' end.
3. Clone them into the appropriate acceptor.
See RFC105 for further details.
