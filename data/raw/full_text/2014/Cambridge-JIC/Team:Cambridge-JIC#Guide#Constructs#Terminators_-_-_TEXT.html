Executive Summary
Keep in contact with us...
Unfortunately, there is a lack of terminators in MP. The only one to find consistent use is the nopaline synthase terminator .
This is a terminator found on the wild-type A. tumefaciens T-DNA!
This makes sequencing multi-gene constructs difficult. Slight variations to the sequence can be introduced via PCR, and mutiple repeats of the terminator can be added.
