Physical Equipment
Marchantia
Growth
You will need a room/compartment at room temperature under full illumination. Ventilation is also recommended, but not essential
Transformation
For transformation using cocultivation , you will need a shaker under full illumination capable of shaking 200ml conical flasks.
Otherwise, a ventilated illumination space at room temperature is sufficient.
Other
Porous tape to seal plates from fungal contamination, but enabling gas exchange, is essential.
Agrobacteria
Growth
You will need a 30degree incubator, as well as a room temperature shaker for growing liquid cultures.
Transformation
You will need electroporation equipment capable of delivering at least 1.25kV (if using 1mm cuvettes). Do not build your own unless you have the prerequisite safety qualifications!
