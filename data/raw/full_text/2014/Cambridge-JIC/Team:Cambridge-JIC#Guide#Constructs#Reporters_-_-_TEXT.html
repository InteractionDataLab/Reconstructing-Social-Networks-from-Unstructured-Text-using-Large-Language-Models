Reporters
Fluorescent proteins
The following fluorescent proteins have been used with consistent results in Marchantia: Venus YFP , MRFP1 and eGFP.
If you have no choice but to use fluorescent proteins with overlapping spectra, consider using one of the localisation tags
Marchantia also has considerable autofluorescence when stressed. Be sure to use a control when analysing fluorescent constructs to ensure that what you observe is indeed what you were looking for.
Localisation Tags
A range of localisation tags can be added to enable to distinguish sources of expression and to visualise individual cells and nuclei. These include: N7 and LTI .
These can be added instead of the stop codon for the reporters. They are incredibly useful when trying to distinguish individual cells, or different fluorescence channels.
These are clearly visible under fluorescence/confocal microscopes. Sample images include:
LTI:
Fluorescent dissecting scope. Excitation:UV, Leica filter set GFP1
N7:
Confocal Microscopy image of eGFP n7. Excitation:488, Detection range: 520-540.
Fluorescent transformants are visible first from 3-5 days after transformation.
Other reporters
GUS staining has been successfully used to characterise expression, as seen in in this paper
