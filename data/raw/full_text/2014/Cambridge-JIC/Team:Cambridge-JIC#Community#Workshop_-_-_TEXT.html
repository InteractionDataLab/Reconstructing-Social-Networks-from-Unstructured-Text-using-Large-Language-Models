2014 Jamboree Plant Workshop
PlantSyntax going global
We have the pleasure to announce that along with the Valencia and UEA team, we will be holding a workshop during the 2014 iGEM Jamborees. The workshop aims to introduce and explore the potential of Plant Synthetic Biology. We will present the cohesive standards across the field, new transformation techniques and introduce the novel organism Marchantia polymorpha. We hope you will be able to attend.
There will be three stations:
A- Standardized Plant Syntax
held by Valencia
B- Transient Expression in Plants
held by UEA
C- Marchantia polymorpha, a model organism
held by Cambridge
Station A: Standardized Plant Syntax
Outline
1- A common Type IIs Grammar for Eukaryotic transcriptional units
2- Introduction to Golden Gate Standards
3- Part Standards
4- Assembly Rules
5- Multi-genic constructs
6- Applications
Valencia will be presenting and share the unified standards of Eukaryotic Synthetic Biology as described in our RFC 105. The station will explain the concept behind Type IIS restriction enzyme cloning via systems such as GB2.0 or MoClo. You can find more information about the systems via: https://gbcloning.org/ or visit Valenca’s Wiki at 2014.igem.org/Team:Valencia_Biocampus
Station B: Transient Expression in Plants
The UEA team have been using an Agrobacteria- mediated transient expression system in N.benthamina. They will explain and present the associated protocols and share their experiences with this technique.   Visit UEA wiki to find out more: 2014.igem.org/Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich
Station C: Marchantia polymorpha
Outline
1- Background and Biology: Why Marchantia?
2- How to grow Marchantia polymorpha: A to Z guide.
3- Transformation Techniques: An step by step Protocol
4- Current developments in the Field: What’s coming up?
5- Our experience with the chassis and mythes debunking
6- Expanding Marchantia’s Toolbox
7- Questions!
Our team will be presenting Marchantia polymorpha, the novel chassis we have been working with. We will discuss its biology, transformation techniques, protocols and recent developments in its field. We hope to familiarize researchers and future Synthetic Biologist with this model organism and give them the tools and information they need to get started with this multicellular system.  Questions that arise from the session will be addressed, may these be practical, ethical or biological. Assisting us will be our two supervisors who are currently working on Marchantia. They will be able to provide answers to more advanced or technical questions that may arise.  We also hope to share our own experiences with the chassis; how our views evolved over the summer. Finally, Marchantia polymorpha is still an emerging chassis. We hope to investigate the tools that could be brought to the field and present the ones we have elaborated over the summer.
