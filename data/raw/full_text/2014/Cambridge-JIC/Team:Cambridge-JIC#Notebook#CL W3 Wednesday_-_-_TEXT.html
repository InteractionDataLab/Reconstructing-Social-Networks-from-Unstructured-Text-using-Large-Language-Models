Hugh
Background reading; work on the wiki; took minutes for group meeting.
Trang-Anh
Finalisation of basic chromoprotein construct design, background reading on data mining.
Ginny
Established contact with the wrong Tokyo Lab group.
Resent mail asking for Unageee antibody to the right Miyawaki group (yes, they had exactly the same name!)
Contacted a consultant nephrologist to get his opinion and some details on bilirubin detection.
Started designing oligos to assemble from scratch Unagee with Gos's help. Only to realize that the whole gene block can be synthesized from IDT and shipped for £70...
other random non-important 'stuff'
Angelina
Made potential wiki design schematics. Together with Salil and Trang-Anh, looked into methods for identifying promoter regions from the genomic and transcriptomic data we have on the marchantia polymorpha cam strain. Devised a rough plan of how we would select regions of interest and transform spores to identify promoters we can use.
