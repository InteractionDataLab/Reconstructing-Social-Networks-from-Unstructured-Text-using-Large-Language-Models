Our Tracks
1- New Application
2- Foundational Advance
3- Information Processing
New Application
Mösbi uses Marchantia polymorpha
Foundational Advance
Innovative ideas are needed to make Synthetic Biology cheap and more open to access. We have taken up the challenge to tackle this core limitation. Our unconventional solution is to modularise plant strains which can then be crossed by simple Mendelian genetics.
Information Processing
Information Processing in iGEM covers a diverse range of projects. Like the Foundational Advance track, IP teams are not trying to solve a real world problem with practical applications, but to tackle an interesting problem that might otherwise not attract attention. Teams enter this track if they are attempting projects such as building elements of a biological computer, creating a game using biology or working on a signal processing challenges.
Engineering ways to make biological systems perform computation is one of the core goals of synthetic biology. We generally work at the DNA level, engineering systems to function using BioBricks. In most biological systems, protein-protein interactions are where the majority of processing takes place. Being able to design proteins to accomplish computation would allow for systems to function on a much faster timescale than the current transcription-translation paradigm. These are some of the challenges that face teams entering projects into the Information Processing track in iGEM.
New Application teams work to create novel, forward thinking projects and innovative ideas that don't fit into conventional paradigms.  It is the novelty of ideas and approach in investigating a question that may never have previously been examined that qualifies a project in the New Application track.
