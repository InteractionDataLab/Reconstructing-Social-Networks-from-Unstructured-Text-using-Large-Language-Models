Promoters
The two most reliable constitutive promoters in MP are the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S and MpEF1a . They have different expression patterns on the thallus, which are summarised in this paper .
The parts above in the registry include the 5'UTRs. If using one of the above, simply have your ATG adjacent to the promoter.
Other plant promoters may or may not produce results in Marchantia.
When trying to express any protein new to Marchantia, it is recommended that you use one of the above in at least one of your constructs. Expression seems to be different in Marchantia from other model plants, so it is important to have a control with a reliable promoter.
Other input possibilities
Another option is the Gal4 Amplification cassette , which can be used to amplify your signal, when used in conjunction with a promoter.
The annotation of the Marchantia genome is underway, so there are other possibilities for promoters being tested currently.
