Enhancer Trap
Prologue
As a relatively new chassis for synthetic biology, Marchantia polymorpha has few promoters and enhancers. The viral promoter '35S' and the '?' are the only highly tested promoters for each. Consequently, we are randomly integrating a plasmid with a minimal promoter driving a GFP gene into the Marchantia polymorpha genome, and observing expression levels. After screening several thousand transformants for sex-specific/developmental-specific/highly strong promoters, we will reverse PCR several kb upstream from the inserted genes. These shall then be released as parts, if successful.
Lab Notebook
Objective: randomly integrate a plasmid with a minimal promoter into the Marchantia genome, using a Venus flo-protein reporter. Then screen, and establish enhancer lines which are tissue or developmental stage specific, or of great strength.
