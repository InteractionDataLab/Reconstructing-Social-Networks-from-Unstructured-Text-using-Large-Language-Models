Outside the Lab
Getting the word out
Opening the Lab to the public
23rd-24th July. We invited groups of international summer exchange students to our department.  We took the opportunity to introduce them to Synthetic Biology and iGEM, shared our lab experience and organized small demonstration session. The sessions sparked a lot of interesting questions, enthusiasm and potential future iGEMmers!
Cafe Synthetic
August 4th. Cafe Synthetic is a monthly science meetup at the local Panther Arms pub, open to anyone interested in Synthetic Biology. We signed up to present our iGEM project and get some critical discussions going. The event was attended by scientists from diverse fields and Salil's presentation captured everyone's attention. The fish n' chips were also very welcomed! http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-Synthetic-Biology-Meetup/ ADD LOGO OF CAFE SYNTHTIC
Sainsbury's Lab Poster Presentation
August 15th. We took part in the University-wide Summer Plant Project day organized by the Sainsbury's Lab. This propelled us to finalize our poster and clarify our core project focus. We presented ___name of Project__ amongst another 30 groups. Explaining our project and getting feedback from people outside our lab helped a lot in highlighting what we should keep or better in our presentation. You can never get too much practice for the Jamborees!      http://www.slcu.cam.ac.uk/ ADD PICTURE OF POSTER
Departmental lunchtime talk
_th September. Still to do. We set up a lunchtime talk in our Department to present our work. It was a good practice presentation and a chance to meet and gain advice plant scientists working next to us. http://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/seminars
YSB2.0
1st-2nd September.
The Cambridge Science Centre
Meeting and Collaborating with other iGEM teams and alumni
Oxford iGEM Conference
19th June. We kicked off the summer by joining the Oxford iGEM conference organized by the Oxford iGEM team. It was a great chance to meet other teams. We connected especially well with the Irish team working on Cystic Fibrosis and look forward to seeing them again at the Jamborees! The buzz of the conference was energizing and revealed the collaborative philosophy of iGEM as opposed to individualistic competition. https://2014.igem.org/Team:Oxford/ouridea
Assisting the Virginia iGEM team
30th June. Having seen Virginia's call for collaboration, we took part their team public awareness project and got to know about their project on biological filters. https://2014.igem.org/Team:Virginia
Alumni Reunion
11th July. Old Cambridge-iGEM team members were kind enough to come by the lab and share some words of wisdom. It was striking to here how their iGEM summer had changed their career path. Theo Sanderson from the E.Glowli 2010 iGEM team gained a pHD post in part thanks to his experience. https://2010.igem.org/Team:Cambridge Matt Jones got a summer internship and other placements. https://2011.igem.org/Team:Cambridge/Team/Students Hannah Copley, also from the 2010 team also stayed local to Cambridge.
Collaborating with the UEA Team
8th Augut. The UEA 2014 iGEM team are also pioneering plants in the iGEM competition. We met up in Norwich to discuss what common standards we should follow and set for future teams. Together we submitted a new RFC promoting a new plan specific vector backbone compatible with both MoClo and BBa standards. https://2014.igem.org/Team:NRP-UEA-Norwich
Meeting with secondary school iGEM teams
19th August. We got in touch with St Paul's 2013 iGEM team, who Will knew, and shared iGEM anecdotes and top tips. https://2013hs.igem.org/Team:St_Pauls_London Through them we met the current St Paul 2014 iGEM team and worked towards collaborating with them.
