Growing Marchantia
Marchantia has a lifecycle, but if you follow these tips, it is very easy to grow, and each plant will reproduce itself asexually for longer than you are willing to keep an eye on it.
Protocol
1. Sterilise and germinate spores following this protocol. Plate them on Marchantia plates and leave them under full illumination (white light) in a ventilated space.
2. Repropagate plants weekly to ensure optimal health.
3. To amplify transformants, harvest gemmae .
4. Avoid using high power lasers/UV light for extended periods of time. Plants will usually recover, but take time to grow!
