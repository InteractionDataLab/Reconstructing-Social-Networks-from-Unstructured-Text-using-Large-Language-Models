Harvesting Gemmae
Marchantia usually forms gemmae around 2 weeks after repropagation. These grow from a single cell, and are isogenic.
Protocol
1. Working in a laminar flow hood, using either a 1ml pipette tip or a cut [with sterile scissors] 200ml tip, squirt 50ul of sterile water into the gemma cup.
2. Pipette up and down, and plate on Marchantia plates
3. Gemmae are visible to the naked eye, so it should be clear when extraction has been successful.
4. Repeat the above until a sufficient amount of gemmae have been harvested.
