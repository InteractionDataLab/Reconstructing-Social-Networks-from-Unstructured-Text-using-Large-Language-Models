Meet the Team
Students
Angelina Munabi
Incoming fourth-year bioengineer, Ange deciphers the Marchantia's genome in search for promoters and is totally amazed by the wonders of genetics. An exercise-junkie and lover of the outdoors, she can often be found out by the river Cam or on it in a boat.
Fergus Riche
Having completing three years as an engineer, this Arduino master designs and manufactures our famous Marchantia Growth Facility (MGF). He enjoys making his own bow ties and keeps his spare components in a colourful lunchbox.
Ginny Rutten
A vet-turned-medic, Ginny is always full of ideas. She brings her enthusiasm and classical music to the wetlab. She is a fan of strawberries (and pretty much everything) with mustard.
Guy Lewy
This incoming second-year biologist works hard to make marchantia smell of raspberries. Sometimes also lured by shiny or colourful things, his constant good mood and friendliness make him a great sponsor hunter. He sees beauty even in miniprep-gunk and likes growing plants at home.
Hugh Wilson
A fourth-year physicist, who saw the summer as a first step into the unknown. He was keen to work on the wiki and tried his hand in the wetlab, showing moderate perseverance in the face of firey incidents.
Miha Pipan, Lab Guru and Team Chef
A third yead biochemist, biotech enthusiast and our Don Draper (Disclaimer: Physical looks may differ in person.). He can usually be found in the wetlab teaching people how to use a pipette, complaining about how messy the lab is and ensuring the day-to-day wet work runs smoothly. Once he cooked a 7 course meal for 30 people
Salil Bhate
A fourth-year mathematician, Salil is the advocate for the modular plug-in framework in Marchantia. He likes knowing how everything is going and where everything is in the lab. He is currently planning an eleven-part construct.
Trang-Anh Nghiem
An incoming third year physicist, Trang-Anh codes to decode Marchantia's genome, does drywork, plays around with the wiki and with graphic design. She can also sometimes be seen trying to pipette. She once designed 90 primers in a row.
Will Kaufhold
Having completed a first year in physics with a cell biology module, Will is the wetlab wizard. He likes grinding plants in liquid nitrogen.

Anton Kan
Anton is one of the big brains in Jim's lab; despite being quite elusive, he helps us nearly continuously debugging experiments and lending us his equipment. (Thank you Anton!)
Bernardo Pollak
A Chilean señor, who collects rare species of fluorescent organisms while surfing; this Hacker is your Marchantia expert...
Christian Boehm
Cha-cha, Ballroom or Waltz, Chris knows them all. This professional dancer also takes the time to swing by to see how we're coping and give us useful advice.
Advisors from previous iGEM teams
Matt Jones, le magnifique
A Cambridge iGEM 2011 Bactiridescence Alumnus who still holds the iGEM spirit.
