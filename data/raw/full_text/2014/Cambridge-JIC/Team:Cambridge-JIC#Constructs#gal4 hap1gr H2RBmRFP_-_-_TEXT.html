Gal4 - Hap1GR - H2BmRFP
Design
Aim of the construct
We'll try out 35s->GAL4->HAP1GR->H2BmRFP.
Since H2BmRFP has not been tried in Mp, we'll also try 35s->H2BmRFP. A positive control for lab technique will be 35s->Venus N7
We'll also use FF's original plasmid to try 35s-Hap1GR-mRFP, as a control for the Hap1GR. I expect low transformation rate as in the original plasmid, we're using 35s as promoter for HygR selection marker.
Not sure whether 35s->Gal4 has been tried (check with BP), so 35s-Gal4-venus n7 is doable with BP's construct as a control
As another control, we'll try 35s-Gal4-H2mRFP

E-Coli transformation

Start date/time: 25/07
Comments:
Negative control negative, positive control positive.
Selection
Attempt 1:
Start date/time: 28/07
Comments:
Selected initially just 3 colonies. Grew them in LB and miniprepped on 27/07. Performed digest with SalI to check for template carryover and see that assembly was done. DEXX3, pb>RVe each have a unique site. Following digest with Sal1, we should have a 12kb fragment and a 2kb fragment.  After digest, 2kb fragment was visible, but 12kb fragment was not. Very mysterious.
Some error in the digestion protocol is likely to have occurred.
To insert a promoter, a digest with Kpn1 was performed. Gel was illegible, although a faint band at 13kb may have been visible. No extraction was made due to poor quality of the gel.  Attempt 2:
Start date/time: 30/07
Comments:
Grew up in LB 8 more colonies. Attempted colony PCR using inoculation loop in dry PCR tube - will wait to see results from GEL. Expect an 8kb fragment: unlikely that this will show results. Will perform a SalI digest with correct protocol on 31/07 following miniprep from colonies.
