Poster and a talk for the iGEM Jamboree ready
We built, characterized, and documented several new and existing BioBrick parts
SILVER MEDAL
We experimentally validated our newly designed device and expression of parts in our the new chassis we have introduced to iGEM.
We documented the characterization of these parts in the "Main Page" sections of those Parts/Devices Registry entries.
We submited those new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Our project, which could have a commercial output, has implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics as well as ownership and sharing. We described how we considered the broader implications and how these considerations were taken into account during the design and execution of our project. The result of these discussions and considerations can be found on our Human Practice and Safety pages.
GOLD MEDAL
We improved the function of an existing BioBrick Part, entered this information in the Registry, created a new registry page for the improved part, and submitted this part to the iGEM Parts Registry. In addition to this, we added spectrum absorbance analysis data to pre-existing parts. We also created a growth chamber prototype.
We collaborated with two other iGEM teams in writing an RFC. We worked with other teams from the EU and US on human practices project. We also helped a high school team.
We outlined issues raised by our project, and looked at how our project fits into the wider context of synthetic biology. We also investigated what 'safety' means in the 21st century and how as a community we evaluate and minimize risk.
Through our presentations, interactions, Human Practices and Outreach projects, we actively promoted Synthetic Biology to a broad range of audience. We also investigated the differences between high school and university level iGEM competition.
We submitted an RFC in collaboration with two other iGEM teams unifiying the grammar of Plant Synthetic Biology: PlantSyntax.
