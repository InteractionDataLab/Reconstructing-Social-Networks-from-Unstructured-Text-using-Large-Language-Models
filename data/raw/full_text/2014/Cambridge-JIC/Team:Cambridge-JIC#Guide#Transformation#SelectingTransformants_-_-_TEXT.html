Selecting Transformants
If using the Marchantia selection cassette , plate spores onto 1/2 B5 + 100ug/ml cefotaxime + 10ug/ml hygromycin + 1.2% agar plates , and leave under full illumination at room temperature to grow.
Always do a negative control for the transformation to grow. Within 3-5 days, the difference between the transformation plate and the control plate is apparent.
Negative control approximately 1.5 weeks after plating
Fluorescent transformants start appearing from 3-5 days onwards
Notes
- Plates often dry out within 2-3 weeks. You will need to repropagate the transformed plantlets to get continued growth of isogenic gemmae.
- Products of Agrobacterium Mediated Transformation are usually chimeric, since insertions of the T-DNA occur randomly. To get isogenic transformants, you need to harvest gemmae after repropagation.
