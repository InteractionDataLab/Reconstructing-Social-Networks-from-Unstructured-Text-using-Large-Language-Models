Today I finalised my spreadsheet of genes for which we’ll be hunting for sequence homologues in the marchantia genome as a way to find promoters we can pull out as parts. I did some preliminary searches using Geneious and realised the limitations of doing this sort of thing on a laptop (slowwwwwww) – especially when combined an approach to running searches that still needs some work. My current thinking is to go about this by doing alignments – so I’ll look into the available plug-ins, and I know I really ought to put some time into getting familiar with the software if I’m going to get anywhere fast. I also spent some time brainstorming about outreach, working on a project description to help with that, and sending networking e-mails to find people who might be interested in collaborating. I’m really keen to do something interactive…. Plus, the policy & practices, ethical and sociological side of plant synthetic biology is pretty interesting….
