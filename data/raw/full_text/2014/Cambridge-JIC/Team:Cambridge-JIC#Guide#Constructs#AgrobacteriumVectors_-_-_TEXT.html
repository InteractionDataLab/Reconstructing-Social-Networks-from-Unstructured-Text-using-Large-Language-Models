Agrobacterium Vectors
Ti Plasmids
The Ti plasmid contains the genes required by Agrobacterium to transfect plants.
Commonly used Ti plasmids are the pSoup plasmid. These are available from GenBank, or from any plant lab. Some of the Ti plasmids are commercial, so can't be submitted to the registry. Please contact a team member if you're having trouble sourcing the Ti plasmid.
T-DNA plasmid
The T-DNA plasmid contains your DNA between the Left Border and Right Border of DNA transfer:
Level 1 + MoClo acceptors  are T-DNA plasmids. You can also consider pGreen2. If you are having trouble sourcing a plasmid suitable for transfection, consider contacting Patron, the author of the Modular Cloning Paper ,
Make sure your Ti plasmids and T-DNA plasmids have different antibiotic resistance markers, else you will not be able to select transformed Agrobacterium!
For Marchantia plasmids, many parts have yet to be domesticated for the registry, or for MoClo. Contact Haseloff Lab for some DNA.
