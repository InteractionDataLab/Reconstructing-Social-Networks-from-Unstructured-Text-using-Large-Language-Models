Ginny's day
wonders whether there's any point in filling this in...  got familiar with the new MoClo Standards and designed chromoproteins in the new biobrick compatible MoClo format
designed primers for the above constructs ready to send tomorrow read some cool stuff about potential symbiotic origin of TB worked on wiki following Matt's reminders :P realized how quickly time can pass...
Forgot to book flights... and played classical music to the lab to help us all stay sane
salil
Miniprepped DNA from ecoli transformation. Messed up - added 100\mu l of buffer P2 but all was okay and DNA was successfully extracted. Good enough concentration to sequence. Ordered primers for the construct. Made wiki page template for recording construct progress on the wiki. Organised DNA library/updated with concentrations of new things. Pestered others to upload progress onto the wiki.
Trang-Anh
Played around with the monster and looked at the results of the Blast run that compared Marchantia candidate proteins and Arabidopsis proteins.
Wrote C++ code to build a codon usage table from the sequences I extracted yesterday. Encountered a variety of compilation errors, segfaults and hearts, spades and smileys in my terminal.
Enjoyed Ginny's classical music.
Hugh

Looked at good wikis from previous years for inspiration
