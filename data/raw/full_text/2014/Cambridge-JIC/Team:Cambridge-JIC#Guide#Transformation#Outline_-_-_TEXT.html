Outline
Agrobacterium mediated transformation is extensively used in many plant and fungal chassis. For Marchantia, two main protocols have been developed to optimise speed and efficiency of transformation:
-the cocultivation method. This requires a shaker capable of shaking a 100ml conical flask at 130rpm under full illumination.
-the agar trap method. This requires only a ventilated space under full illumination at room temperature.
Timing
The cocultivation method requires spores to be (at least) 5 days old prior to cocultivation with agrobacterium, and the agar trap 3 days old. Agrobacteria takes 3 days to grow after transformation .
For each method, your timing will be optimal if you prepare spores and transform agrobacteria on day 1.
