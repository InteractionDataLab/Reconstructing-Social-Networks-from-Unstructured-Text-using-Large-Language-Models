Coding Sequences
If possible, codon optimise your sequence for use in plants, or preferably for use with Marchantia polymorpha. A codon table for Marchantia produced from predicted ORFs is available on this wiki.
There is evidence of a considerable number splice sites in the MP genome, so there is no guarantee that a coding sequence that works in other chassis will be correctly translated in Marchantia.
Best to try!
