Strains and Living material
Marchantia
The Haseloff lab uses the CAM1 and CAM2 strain. Other researched strains are the TAK1 strain.
To create your own stock of Marchantia, you can also use a local strain. Marchantia can be found widely in damp areas, or in plant nurseries as a weed. Cultivate these in soil - they require very little attention - and follow sexual reproduction to gain your own spores.
Agrobacterium
GV2260 works, and other strains probably do also. You can either purchase these directly, or get a stab sent to you by any plant lab.
You will need to prepare electrocompetent agro in order to use it for transformation protocols.
E-Coli
Use any strain you have access to! They just need to be able to grow microgram quantities of plasmid DNA!
