Ginny's day
escaped catastrophe: primers made yesterday were pretty wrong...
remade new set_phew. MoClo_Biobrick compatible.
wetwork: co-cultured Marchantia spores with Agoro (RFP & GFP)
pursued secret side experiment___hold your breath
Trang-Anh's day
Got the codon counter to work (yay!) and ran the analysis on the monster. Obtained marchy codon table.
Looking at codon table: c preferred at the end of codons and c-g sites frequent, as in Arabidopsis.
Wrote up on the bioinformatics progress so far.
Will
Enhancer trap experimental design. Vector for random integration of minimal promoter into Marchy genome designed, and primers acquired. Jim gave me his vector for amplification of the minimal promoter (NB: it's an Arabidopsis promoter- although surely there must be some degree of homology between Eukaryotas, and *definitely* among plants). Ideally need Bernardo's vector as well. Primers arrive on Friday; will make vector then.
