July
We had a meeting with SZU-China on 19th July just after deciding the project. They made a banner especially for us and gave us a warm welcome. We presented two projects in sequence and gave each other valuable suggestions.
It’s their first time to join in the whole iGEM family, so we then talked about the experience in establishing an iGEM team and doing project.
August
The Second Conference
We attended the 2nd iGEM Conference held by NCTU_Formosa. In the conference, every team had 20 minutes to present their projects and 10-minnute Q&A section. The professors and iGEMers present gave many suggestions to the team which was doing presentation. And we also had poster section to explain our projects to iGEMers who are interested face to face. We had a great time there and learned a lot from other teams. We developed deep friendship with other teams and kept in touch closely since then.
Meet up in SUSTC
SCUT and Shenzhen_SFLS (High School Division) came to SUSTC on 26th August. Everyone had an opportunity to introduce himself briefly. We did presentations and communicated a lot about team running. Then we showed them our lab and went for a short tour in our campus.
