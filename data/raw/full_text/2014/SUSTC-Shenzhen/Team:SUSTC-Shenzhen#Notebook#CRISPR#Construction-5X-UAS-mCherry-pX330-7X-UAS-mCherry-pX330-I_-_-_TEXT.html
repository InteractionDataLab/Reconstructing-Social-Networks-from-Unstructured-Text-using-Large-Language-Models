Transformation
Till now,
Ligation reaction I without digestion: 6.5ul
Ligation reaction II with digestion: 15.6ul
We transform bacteria with Ligation reaction I & II, respectively.
[5ul reaction to 50ul competent cell]
Results
There were no colonies growing on the plate transformed with Ligation reaction II (digested).
There were decades of colonies growing on the plate transformed with Ligation reaction I.
So, we suspected that the failure of ligation reaction II transformation was caused by the still activated digestion enzyme EcoRI which interfered with the transformation process, since we didn’t perform heat-inactivation before transformation.
