Why Do We Come Up With This
While many other teams go to high schools to introduce synthetic biology by presentation, we choose to have some great time with kids because it brings us sense of achievement when we provide them new ideas and see their eyes full of yearning even it is comparatively challenging. It’s difficult to explain synthetic biology or iGEM to young children by telling them the concepts. But we think the exact comprehension is not important for those kids. What matter most are their curiosity to the new objects and their “unrealistic” thoughts.

How We Did This
We gathered the students who were interested to draw together during their drawing classes. They are all very excited about designing their own creatures. Some students devoted three classes to completing their work. Take home drawings are also admitted, as there is a seven-day holiday from Oct. 1st. These children got some help from their parents (writing introduction for the drawings). We also asked communities to help us contact the kids living in the neighborhood. They posted the posters and collected drawing for us.

What We’ve Got
To our great surprise, we receive many works which are beyond our imaginations. There are flowers that have the function of clock, hippo that can test the temperature and colorful fishes that can be seen in the deep sea. These creatures are so much like the engineering bacteria in previous iGEM projects and one of the students used geometric figures to form his imaginary creatures which is very similar to the concept of biobricks. Besides these, there are still many other creatures they invented waiting for us to explore. One of the most wonderful design is a plant named ‘Eye-ear Flower’. It got two kinds of fruits, one named ‘eye’ and another named ‘ear’. The juice of ‘eye’ can help blind people see things by dropping into their eyes. And the ‘ear’ can help the deaf people hear things in the same way. ‘Eye’ and ‘ear’ have five and four colors respectively and people use them according to the color of their eyes and ears.

Significance of the Contest
We use another way to inspire students’ imagination and guide them to focus on the originality of their work while their teachers usually emphasize skills. We also arise their interests in creating and exploring. The competition shows their unique perspective of seeing things. And their masterpieces provide more possibilities when we are thinking of new projects.
