Determining the appropriate concentration of puromycin for cell selection
2014/8/17
Prepare for selection
Introduction
The plasmid for the stable transfection of Cas9 gene encodes puromycin resistance. So the minimum level of puromycin to be added to the culture medium to prevent the normal HeLa cells growth needs to be determined for the following cell line selection. The recommended concentration of mammalian cell lines is 1-10μg/ml. And for HeLa cell it is 3μg/ml (from Antibiotics gene transfection) and 2μg/ml (from Invitrogen).
Materials
HeLa cells.
Puromycin (10mg/ml).
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
24 well plate.
Procedures
8.17. Morning
Preparation for the test of puromycin concentration. Seed cells on a 24-well plate, seed 100,000 cells in every well and 12 wells in total.
8.18 Morning
The cells grow well and uniformly, the confluence was almost 100% before adding medium with puromycin, a small ratio of cells turn round (It might result from the extremely high confluence).

Table 1. The puromycin gradient
Add 0.5mL of complete medium with different puromycin concentration according to the table above.
10 h after adding puromycin, there was no obvious change of the morphology of the cells.
30 h after adding puromycin, the medium was discarded and the cells were washed with PBS and added new medium, and the cells were observed again.
The control group growed well. The higher the concentration of the puromycin, the less living cells could be observed. It is obvious that the most cell in 3 or 4ng/μL puromycin died.
8.20
The concentration of puromycin(μg/mL)
Description
0
The confluence is very high, and part of cells become round
1
High confluence, part of cells are suspended
1.5
Many cells are suspended
2-2.5
Most cells are suspended
3-4
Almost all of the cells are dead
Table 2. The observation after 2-day’s puromycin treatment
8.21
The concentration of puromycin(μg/mL)
Description
0
The confluence is very high, and part of cells become round
1
High confluence
1.5
There are still some living cells
2-4
Few living cells can be found
Table 3. The observation after 3-day’s puromycin treatment
8.22 AM
The concentration of puromycin(μg/mL)
Description
0
The confluence is very high, and part of cells are suspended
1-1.5
Many cells are suspended
2- 4
Almost all of the cells are suspended
Table4. The observation after 4-day’s puromycin treatment
The result
2.0 μg/mL puromycin is enough to kill all of the normal HeLa cells within 4 days
3.0 μg/mL puromycin is enough to kill almost all of the normal HeLa cells within 2 days
