1.Add as table describes
2.incubate for about 0.5 hrs
3.use the spectrometer to get the data
4.compare the sample with the principle data
Select the 1st elution protein as the sampling sample
TEG: for 50uL, A=0.198-- c=2.66ug/L
GD5: for 50uL, A=0.129-- c=1.01ug/L
Evaluation
The concentration of protein is too low for us to us, especially after the recovery, the concentration will be less than 1ug/L. (we must have at least 10ug/L’s protein, or we can’t get enough useful protein)
Method
1. use the protein we made lately. 2. try to use the precious protein
