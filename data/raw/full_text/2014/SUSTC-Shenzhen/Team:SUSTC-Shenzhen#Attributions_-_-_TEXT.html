Students
Yicong Tao-Team leader
He led us in experiments design and gave advice. Biobricks characterization was his main work.And he participated in  gRNA plasmids design.
Fan Jiang & Mingmeng Geng
Fan Jiang is primary in modeling and bioinformatics. gRNA for HIV was designed by him. He and Peng Peng designed gRNA for HBV together. Mingmeng Geng helped him with modeling.
Jinglin Wang
She is primary in Human Practice. And she communicated with other teams on behalf of us. Yicong Tao helped her a lot.
Lidan Zeng & Lin Le
They did Hela cells culture. Plasmid of Cas9 was also constructed by them.
Longze Su & Yongkang Long
They did GAL4 protein purification.
Mengqi Xu & Sijia Liu
Plasmids of gRNA were constructed by them. And they participated in the construction of biobricks with Rifei Chen.
Rifei Chen
He and Yushan Zhang participated in Inter-lab Study. And he also did the work of constructing biobricks for our projects.
Yushan Zhang
She participated in Inter-lab Study and biobricks design with Rifei Chen, and helped Yicong Tao in biobricks characterization.
Instructors
Jiankui He
He prepared for team establishing and helped us in bioinformatics.
Wei Huang
His laboratory located in Hong Kong helps us a lot in plasmid construction. He also gave us important advice on performing wet-lab experiments.
Advisors
Fangxing Jia
He led us in experiments training and gave a lot of advice on experiments.
