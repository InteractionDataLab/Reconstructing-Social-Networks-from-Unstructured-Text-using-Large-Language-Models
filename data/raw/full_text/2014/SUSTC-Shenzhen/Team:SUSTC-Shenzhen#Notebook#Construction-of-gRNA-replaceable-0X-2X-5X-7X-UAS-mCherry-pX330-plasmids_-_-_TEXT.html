Protocol
a. incubate at RT for 15min
b. heat-inactivation at 65C for 10min
c. Transformation
Performed as protocol…
5ul ligation reaction to 50ul competent cell
Results
Except 0X group, all the other groups have colonies grown out!
Since we still have 15ul ligation reaction remaining for each group, we just transformed bacteria with 0X ligation reaction again. [10ul ligation reaction to 100ul competent cell]
Further results
Luckily, this time there were one colony growing out on the 0X plate!
