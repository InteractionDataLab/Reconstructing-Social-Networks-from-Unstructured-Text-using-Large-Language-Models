Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts. Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
All of parts we submitted
SILVER
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
Parts: BBa_K1431101 , BBa_K1431301 , BBa_K1431812 , BBa_K1431813 , BBa_K1431814 , BBa_K1431824 ,

Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.

①With SZU-China
In our communications with SZU-China in July, we gave them several suggestions such as involving suicide system in the circuit design to enhance safety. Since it’s their first time to attend iGEM, we shared the experience about team building and registering and helped them to get familiar with metal requirements.  We consulted them how to use of flow cytometry and freeze-dry machine.
②With SJTU-Software
We helped SJTU-Software to test their software, recorded the testing video and took the photos. And we also gave the suggestions as following: a.Improve server response speed; b.Add log output; c.Grateful Shutdown and Exception Handling; d.Use native code in GUI components, which should be significantly faster and more flexible in comparison to Swing;
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM).
