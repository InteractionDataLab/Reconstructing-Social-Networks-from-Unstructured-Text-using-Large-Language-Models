Endotoxin Free plasmid purification for pX330+mCherry, pX330+mCherry+GAL4
2014/8/21~2014/8/22
Materials
EndoFree Plasmid Kit (TIANGEN)
Methods
1. Picked up 2 monoclones from each plate (pX330+mCherry12ml&pX330+mCherry+GAL4)
2. Incubate:
Incubate in 18ml ampicillin medium for pX330+mCherry plasmid, and 22ml for pX330+mCherry+GAL4 plasmid. Put in shaker at 37C for 14h [8.12 6:45pm~8.22 8:45 am]
3. Endotoxin Free plasmid purification for pX330+mCherry, pX330+mCherry+GAL4 Performed as the usual protocol provided by TIANGEN plasmid Kit, except that we eluted for three times at the last step with 100ul EB solution.
