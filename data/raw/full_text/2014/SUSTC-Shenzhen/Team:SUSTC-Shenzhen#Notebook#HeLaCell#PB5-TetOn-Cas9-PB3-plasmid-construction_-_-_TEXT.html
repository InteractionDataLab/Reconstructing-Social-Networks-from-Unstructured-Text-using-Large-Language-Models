Figure 2. The image of electrophoresis of digestion product of px330 and pBx-083 with NotI, AgeI, AflIII. The first three columes are px330 react with AgeI and NOtI, The other columes are pBx-093 digest with AgeI and NotI and AflIII(additional cut for fragment seperation). Both the first row are strips we need.
The image of electophoresis shows that all strips are beautifully bright and clear and straight, moreover, on the exact position relative to marker. Which means that the endonuclease digestion and electrophoresis are successful.
The first two steps are perfect for next step.

Step5. Transformation DH5α, Extract plasmid
Objective
Materials
Ligation production 3 groupes
Ice box
EP tubes
Competent cell: DH5α
LB agar plate with Amp. antibiotics
42°C waterbath
LB media
Plasmid mini extract kit(TianGen)
Pipette tips
Method
Transform the Ligation production into competent cell. All the linear DNA will not have any impact to cell and curcular plasmid may transform into competent cells. Those cell with plasmid can express the resistence to Amp. because the vector PB5-TetON-PB3 has a resistence gene of Amp.
After bacteria on plate grows into a colony, we pick up the colony inoculate into LB and incubation over night to amplificate the plasmid.
Protocols
Procedure: Transformation
Thaw competent cells on ice and then pre-chill by placing the tubes on ice.
Pipet 50μl of competent cells into 3 EP tubes.
Pipet 1μl of ligation product DNA into each tube. Flick the tube gently to mix.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes.
Heat-shock the cells, 42°C waterbath, 1 minute.
Immediately transfer the tubes back to ice, and incubate on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 300ul of LB media per tube, 37°C, 45 min at 180rpm.
Prepare 4 argar plates marking 4 different groups (One without plasmid)
Pipet 20ul from each tube, spread the mixture evenly across the plate.
We also did a control . Except for not being transfected by plasmid, other Protocolss were all the same with those experimental groups.
Incubate these agar plates at 37°C overnight.
Procedure: Plasmid Extract
Pick monoclones with tweezers and a sterile white pipette tip.
Put the tip into 3ml LB in test tube.
Incubate test tube at 37°C over night
Extract plasmid following the protocol of plasmid extract kit
Concentration test with nanodrop
Supposed Results

No clones on Group3 and blank.
Can extract correct plasmid from monoclones.

Figure 5. The strange result of negative control, supposed to be no colonied. But the plate has 18 colonies.
Discussion
There are 18 colones on the negative control plate. But all the DNA ligation ractant are recover from gel. So the fake positive result probably comes from the complemental last two nucleus tide of sticky end of AgeI and NotI.
To avoid picking the fake positive plasmid we choose 6 monoclones 2 form group 1 and 4 frome group 2. Then it is almost impossible to fail to extract the correct plasmid.

Laboratory note
Figure 6. All six plasmid has digest. The strips of 1422 1351 1212 are the characteristic strips. Digestion can generate such strips only if Cas9 is inserted into TetON vector.
The image of electrophoresis of PstI digestion of first amplicated. Six plasmids of different six monoclone are form two test group insert with Cas9 proterin into TetOn vector. The image shows that the strip of electrophoresis is kind of dim, but straight and clear, which is at the position it suppose to be relative to marker.
Some strips went out the gel, so we can not see those from the image. The cause of out range may be high voltage and too long running time. So we low down the voltage and cut the running time in the following futhur verification.
Endo-free plasmid verification
