Running conditions：130V, 30min
Results
Supposed results: Two bands: 4200, 800bp Actual results:
There was no band appearing on the position that aligned to 800bp pointed by marker, and the bands of 4200bp were also very indistinct, all of which might be caused by the low concentration of our DNA sample loaded for electrophoresis.
