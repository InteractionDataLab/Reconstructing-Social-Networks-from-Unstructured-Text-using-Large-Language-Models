Point-mutation PCR for UAS
2014/8/20
Materials
Q5TM High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (DNA polymerase, dNTPs, Mg++, buffer)
Forward primer
Reverse primer
Template DNA (PB5-PolyA-5xUAS-mcherry-lin-oct4-Neo--GpA-GpA-PB3)
dd H2O
Methods
Point-mutation PCR for UAS
1. Centrifuge the primers 12000 rmp for 5 min.
2. Dissolve the primers into dd H2O to the concentration of 50p mol/μl. Subpackage the solution for about 50 μl per tube to avoid repeated freezing and thawing.
3.Add 1μl template DNA into 9μl dd H2O to dilute the template DNA.
4. The total volume is 250μl, including 125 μl Q5TM High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (dilute it from 2X to 1X), 2.5μl forward primer, 2.5μl the first kind of reverse primer, 1 μl diluted template DNA and 119μl dd H2O. And divide the 250 μl solution into 5 PCR tubes in average. Attention, the operation should be finished on ice.
5. Set the PCR machine and run:
Stage1: Initial denaturation: 98°C，30s.
Stage2: Denaturation :98°C，10s
Anneal: 57°C，59°C，61°C，63°C，65°C，respectively.15s.
Extension: 72°C, 10s.
30 cycles.
Stage3: Final extension：72°C, 5 min.
Hold: 4°C.
6. Check the product by gel eletrophoresis.
7. Keep the product in -20°C.
Electrophoresis for the product of PCR
According to gel eletrophoresis, the PCR is successful under all anneal temperatures.

Results of electrophoresis
From the picture, we can see that, the position of digested PCR fragment aligned with that of the fragment cut down from the original plasmid, which indicated the success of our point-mutation PCR.
