Assumption
Successful situation:
gRNA sequence has been replaced by a fragment which carries BbsI site. So, there is a BbsI site on each plasmid now.
Plasmid became linearized when digested by B only. [the same as digested with A only]
Plasmid was cut into two fragments by A & B.
Failed situation:
gRNA sequence hasn’t been replaced. So, there is no BbsI site on each plasmid now.
Plasmid had no change when digested with B only. [the same as original plasmid]
Plasmid just became linearized by A & B. [the small as digested with A only]
Actual results
Obviously, all of the for plasmids matched the successful items above.  Thus, we can pronounce that our construction of gRNA replaceable 0X/2X/5X/7X UAS-mcherry-pX330 plasmids has succeeded!
