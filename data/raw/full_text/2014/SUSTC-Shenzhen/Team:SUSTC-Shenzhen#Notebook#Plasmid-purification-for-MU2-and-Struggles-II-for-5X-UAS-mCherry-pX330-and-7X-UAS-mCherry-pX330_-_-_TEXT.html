Plasmid purification (no endotoxin) for M+U2
Since we have confirmed that M+U2 is a successful one, we performed plasmid purification (no endotoxin) for it.
Method
Performed as protocol
Results
Concentration :130.5ng/ul
Struggles II for the first-time construction of 5X-UAS -mCherry-pX330 & 7X-UAS-mCherry-pX330
Till now, we still haven’t got one successful M+U+G monoclone. Thus, we then performed restriction digestion for the remaining undigested 6.5ul ligation reaction I, and transformed…

Transformation
Performed as protocol
[10ul DNA to 100ul competent cell]
Results
For the newly digested-and-transformed group, there were no colonies growing out on the 5XUAS+mCherry-pX330 plate (It doesn’t matter, since we still got one successful M+U monoclone). And there was only one colony growing out on the 5XUAS+GAL4-mCherry-pX330 plate.
