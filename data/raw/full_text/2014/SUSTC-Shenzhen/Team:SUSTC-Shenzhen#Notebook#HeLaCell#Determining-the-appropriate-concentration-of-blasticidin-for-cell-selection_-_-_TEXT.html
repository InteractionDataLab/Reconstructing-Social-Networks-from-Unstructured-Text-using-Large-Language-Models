Prepare for selection
Introduction
The plasmid pBX-083 for the stable transfection of EGFP gene encodes blasticidin resistance. So the minimum level of blasticidin to be added to the culture medium to prevent the normal HeLa cells growth needs to be determined for the following cell line selection. The recommended concentration of mammalian cell lines is 1-10μg/ml. And for HeLa cell it is 1-3μg/ml (from Invitrogen).
Materials
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1x Penicillin-Streptomycin
HeLa cells.
Blasticidin(bla) (10mg/ml).
24 well plate.

Procedures
Aug.27 Seed plate 10,0000 cells per well
Wash cells with PBS, trypsin digestion, add complete medium to stop digestion
Transfer the cell suspension into 15 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 1000rpm for 5 min.
Discard the supernatant and add 2 mL complete medium to suspend the cells.
Dilution and count the cell concentration with blood counting chamber.
Take 2,400,000 cells and add medium to get a total volume of 24mL, mix well.
Add 1mL cell diluted suspension got in step 5 to each well.
Shake the plate to make cell distribution uniform.
(On the evening of 28th Aug) Culture cells in the medium containing blasticidin:
Add 100μL 5mg/mL Blasticidin to 50mL complete medium, mix well to get medium containing 10μg/mL Blasticidin.
Get medium of different concentration of Bla. By adding different volume of medium containing 10μg/mL Blasticidin and corresponding medium without antibiotic. (Eg: 1.6μg/mL = 160μL 10μg/mL + 840μL medium without antibiotic.) Mix well, discard the old medium and add 0.5ml to the well of responding concentration.
Observe the morphology of the cells in the following day. And the replace new medium with corresponding concentration of Blasticidin with the old medium every 2 or 3 days.
Results
31th Aug.
The concentration blasticidin
No more than 4.0μg/mL
No obvious morphology changes
5.0μg/mL
Half cells are suspended
6.0μg/mL
About 20-30% cells are still adherent
1st Sept.
4 days blasticindin treatment
<2.4 μg/mL
No obvious morphology changes
>=2.4μg/mL
Many cells are suspended
>=3.6μg/mL
Large amount of cells are dead
2nd Sept.
3rd Sept.
4th Sept.
5th Sept.
Conclusions
Conclusions:
4.0μg/mL Bla is enough to kill all HeLa cells within 4 days.
3.6μg/mL Bla is enough to kill all HeLa cells within 6 days.
3.2μg/mL Bla is enough to kill all HeLa cells within 7 days.
2.8μg/mL Bla is enough to kill all HeLa cells within 8 days.
