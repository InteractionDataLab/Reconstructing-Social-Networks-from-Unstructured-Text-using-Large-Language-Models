</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Abstract"><B>Abstract</B></SPAN></H2><P>There are <B>three types</B> of gRNA-carried related plasmids. Each type carries out a different function. </P><P><B>The first four</B> plasmids which carry the <B>gRNA for EGFP</B> aim to <B>check</B> if <B>the CRISPR-Cas9 system</B> we create in human cell can work well, which might be the foundation for the further experiments. <B>The following three plasmids</B> carried no gRNA sequences but <B>two BbsI sites</B> are capable for the <B>insertions of any wanted gRNA sequences</B>. As for <B>the last nine plasmids</B>, actually they come from the type two plasmids, but have <B>been inserted with gRNA for HIV/HBV</B>. Thus, they can be used to target for HIV/HBV gene sequence that has been integrated in human chromosome specially. </P><P>However, although each type with different missions, they still have plenty of components in common. You can see, nearly all of them carry <B>at least one UAS sequences</B>, since UAS sequences are necessary for <B>binding with the non-viral DNA delivery vehicle</B>. And also, <B>mCherry-3*NLS</B> is another DNA sequence which appears in all of the 16 plasmids. This is because this part plays an important role in <B>efficiency test</B>, both for gRNA transportation and cut-off ability of CRISPR-Cas9. </P><P>Following are three profiles of plasmids, served as  <B>examples</B> for each type:
</P><CENTER>Figure 1. This picture shows the profile of plasmid gRNAforEGFP-mCherry-NLS-5XUAS, in which each part with different features has been labeled with different colors. For mCherry sequence, which belongs to a type of RFP, we choose red, while the repeated five UAS sequences are shown in rainbow. The tiny cyan bar on the top of the profile is the protagonist of this plasmid, gRNA for EGFP, which is used to guide the Cas9 protein to the specific locus in human cells.</CENTER><CENTER>Figure 2. This is one of the four kinds of gRNA carried plasmid backbones with 5XUAS sequences [the other three has 2X, 5X, 7XUAS, respectively]. In addition to UAS and mCherry-3*NLS sequences, there are also two BbsI enzyme sites on this plasmids, which are prepared for the insertion of any gRNA sequences we wanted.</CENTER><CENTER>Figure 3. Plasmid gRNAforHIV/HBV-mCherry-NLS-5XUAS is a member of the nine plasmids that have been already inserted with specific gRNA for HIV/HBV sequences. Thus, they can be directly used to target for the HIV/HBV genes integrated in human chromosomes.</CENTER><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Part_I_Plasmid_construction_Design:_Why_do_we_construct_them.3F"><B>Part I Plasmid construction Design:</B> Why do we construct them?</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Why_do_we_design_plasmids_that_only_carry_gRNA_sequence_without_Cas9.3F"><B>Why do we design plasmids that <FONT color="blue">only carry gRNA sequence without Cas9?</FONT></B></SPAN></H3><P><I><B>One main thought of our project is to achieve the transferring of Cas9 system and gRNA sequences into human body separately at different period of time.</B></I></P><P>As you know, there are two parts in our CRISPER system, one is the Cas9 proteins, and the other is the gRNA. To begin with, Cas9 system will be stably transfected into human cells firstly, remaining inactivated and just waiting for orders. While the transportation of gRNA will not be performed until the diseases have developed, and types of retrovirus that cause these diseases are confirmed. Then, since the type of the pathogenic retrovirus has been known at this moment, we can design a gRNA that can specifically recognize the very type of retrovirus, and transfer it into human body. Finally these gRNA will combine with activated Cas9 proteins, guiding them to the genome sequence of retrovirus, at last destroying it. </P><P><I><B>By this way, we can achieve a more specific introduction of gRNA into human cells, specifically targeting for the very type of retrovirus that caused the disease. The separated transportations of the two parts may also partially overcome the difficulties of radical cure, always met in usual treatment, due to the high variability of retrovirus. </B></I></P><P>That’s why we constructed these plasmids, and each of which are used to carry gRNA sequence into human cells. Among them, four have already carried gRNA sequences, thus can be transferred directly [gRNAforEGFP-pX330-mCherry-NLS-0XUAS, gRNAforEGFP-pX330-mCherry-NLS-2XUAS, gRNAforEGFP-pX330-mCherry-NLS-5XUAS, gRNAforEGFP-pX330-mCherry-NLS-7XUAS]. While the other three are only designed with BbsI site, preparing for the specific gRNA sequence insert [BbsISiteForgRNA-pX330-mCherry-NLS-2XUAS,BbsISiteForgRNA-pX330-mCherry-NLS-5XUAS, BbsISiteForgRNA-pX330-mCherry-NLS-7XUAS].

Thus, by replacing A subunit of A-B toxin with GAL4, we will get a chimeric fusion protein that can transfer plasmids with UAS into host cells specifically. </P><P><I><B>Therefore, it is necessary for our plasmids to carry at least one UAS sequence, so that they can be recognized, and at the same time combine with the DNA delivery shuttle, and finally be transported into human cells.</B></I></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Why_do_we_construct_plasmids_with_different_number_of_UAS_sequences.3F"><B>Why do we construct plasmids with <FONT color="blue">different number of UAS sequences?</FONT></B></SPAN></H3><P>When GAL4 binds with UAS carried plasmids, their binding affinity may differ among plasmids that carry different number of UAS sequences. <I><B>To test the binding efficiency of GAL4 part in our DNA delivery vehicle, we totally constructed four plasmids, each of which carried 0X, 2X, 5X, 7X UAS sequences respectively. </B></I>By comparing their binding results with the GAL4, we can screen out the most efficient one with the optimum UAS number for binding. Therefore, in the following construction of specific gRNA carried plasmids, we can use this number as a standard, to achieve the most effective transportation.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Why_dose_each_of_our_plasmids_still_carries_a_mCherry-3.2ANLS_sequence.3F"><B>Why dose each of our plasmids still carries a <FONT color="blue">mCherry-3*NLS sequence?</FONT></B></SPAN></H3><P>Although it seems that the mCherry-3*NLS sequence in our plasmid has little contribute to our CRISPR-Cas9 working system, this part of DNA sequence dose make sense, when we plans to test the working efficiency of the whole system.</P><P>Before using our non-viral DNA delivery system, we need to test the delivery efficiency of this chimeric protein system at first. So, we add the mCherry-3*NLS gene sequence just behind a human U6 promoter in our plasmids. If our plasmids have been successfully transported into human body cells, the 3*NLS sequences will lead these plasmids into the nuclei. After a series of processes like transcription, translation and modifications, mCherry red fluorescence protein(RFP) will finally be expressed and excitated a bright red fluorescence under the fluorescence microscope. <I><B>In this way, we can visualize how many plasmids on earth are transferred into nuclei, just by detecting and counting the number of red-fluorescence-emitting cells. </B></I></P><P>What’s more, with this RFP expression mechanism we are able to roughly <I><B>estimate the cut-off efficiency of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, by using the ratio between amount of green fluorescence reduced and quantity of red fluorescence generated.</B></I> [Please see Cell Culture part for more details about CRISPR-Cas9 system efficiency test]</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Why_do_we_also_construct_plasmids_with_no_gRNA_sequences_but_two_BbsI_restriction_enzyme_sites.3F"><B>Why do we also construct plasmids with <FONT color="blue">no gRNA sequences but two BbsI restriction enzyme sites?</FONT></B></SPAN></H3><P>Since we want to achieve a specific introduction of gRNA that can specifically target for the very type of retrovirus, it is reasonable to come up with the idea about constructing a plasmid which is convenient for various sequences of gRNA insertions. This plasmid will act as a backbone that carries the appropriate restriction enzyme sites for gRNA insertion and all the other necessary parts (except gRNA sequence) in the former plasmids. </P><P>For this reason, we replace the gRNA sequences in our former plasmids with a DNA fragment that carries two BbsI sites, to achieve the insertions of any gRNA sequences we wanted. <I><B>With this gRNA carried plasmid backbone, we can introduce any gRNA sequences exactly for the specific retrovirus at any time, partially overcoming the difficulties of radical cure, which are always met in usual treatment, due to the high variability of retrovirus.</B></I></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Part_II_Method:_How_do_we_construct_them.3F"><B>Part II Method:</B> How do we construct them?</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="A._Construction_of_gRNA-for-EGFP_carried_plasmids"><B>A.
