Stably Transfected HeLa cell line construct
2014/8/15
Construct stably transfected HeLa cells!
Introduction
In our project, we have to get rid of gene and DNA that lentivirus has integrated into ours genome by Cas9 protein.
So we select green fluorescent protein gene to simulate gene of lentivirus such as HIV and HBV. Then we stably tranfect GFP into HeLa cells, which represent that the lentivirus genome has integrate into human genome. Then we stably transfect Cas9 gene into HeLa cell, which represent we modified Hematopoietic stem cell and integrate Hematopoietic stem cell with Cas9 gene.
In the experiment we use piggy bac transponase to integrate gene into HeLa cells. Next we integrate Cas9 gene and EGFP gene by PB transposon. Cas9 is under control of Teton 3G promoter, so we can induce expression of Cas9 by treating cells with doxycycline.
When cells have expressed Cas9 protein we deliver plasmid encoding gRNA targeting EGFP to help Cas9 specificly cut DNA of EGFP. As a consequence, EGFP will be slience after HeLa cells have been treated with Doxycycline and gRNA.

Microscope Observation
[2014 Aug 16th 9:00am]
The first day after transfection
We change to medium into complete medium at 10%FBS 12 hours after transfection according to protocol. And take picture under microscope.
Laboratory note
The transfected cells are observed before we change the medium.
Figure 1. Pictures are captured by phase contrast microscope. We can see clearly that some cells has suspended and became round. Strangely the G3 well 1 has a apparent amount of cells at abnormal status.
It is found that part of the cells round and suspended, and part of cells just become round. But the morphology of most of the cells are normal.
Passage cell to dish
[2014 Aug 16th 15:00pm]
The first day after transfection
Passage part of cells to the 10cm petri dish (for picking monoclonal later except G5), and the remaining cells are still seeded on the previous 24-well plates (about 500μL cell suspension per well). (15:00 pm – 18:00 pm)  For every group, two dishes with 5,000 cells seeded and two dished with 50,000 cells seeded.

Discussion
When counting cells, some dead cells were observed, and those cells were not included. The second day morning, some of the cells on the petri dish are round and suspended. Cells were few and scattered. For dishes with 5,000 cells, only several cells can be observed in one field under 4X objective lens. For dishes with 50,000 cells, near 10-20 cells can be observed in one field under 4X objective lens.

The forth day after transfection
Passage cells
[2014 Aug 19th 00:00am]
Passage cells of every Groups from wells to petri dishes. Use antibiotics to kill cells without resistance. Only those with resistance can survive, can express gene we transform both resistance gene and gene we need.
Cells left after passage to the petri dish for monoclones are passage to another petri dish to construct a pool of all kinds of cells expressing resistance.But less stable and less homogeneous than monoclones.
Procedures
Wash cells with PBS for 2 times
Add trypsin 1ml and discard to digest for 2min at 37°C.

Seed plate for second transfection
[2014 Aug 22th 18:30pm]
Prepare for the second transfection.
We think that the first transfection may not be good enough, as a result, we prepare for the second time transfection. Just the same as the first time, we schemed to transfect HeLa cells with 3 different combination of plasmid.
Tree combinations
Group A
EGFP:Piggybac = 1:1
Group B
Cas9:EGFP:Piggybac = 1:1:1
Group C
Cas9:Piggybac = 1:1
We seed HeLa cells in 6-well-plate (6wells at total), 100,000 cells per well. For tansfection
Procedure
Wash cells with PBS, trypsin digestion, and medium to stop digestion.
Discard the supernatant and add 8ml complete medium to resuspend the cells.
Add 1ml PBS to every gap between well
1:10 dilution count the cell concentration with blood counting slide. Get the concentration: 760,000 cells/ml. 0.78ml cell suspendion + about 9ml DMEM with 10% FBS. Mix well and add 1.5ml per well, to mix well pepite the well gently.
Result
Cells seeded really even, but wrong concentration. Fever concentration of transfection is about 200,000 cells per well, so we have to culture cells in well for days.

The fluorescence rate is very high of the first time transfected cells. So we passage them and prepare to preserve.
Change medium
We change the selection medium of T2 cells.
We change medium of monoclones.
We change medium of T1 cells.
Sept 1st
The sixth day after second transfection
Fluorescent Observation
[2014 Sept 1st 11:35]
We Observed the fluorescent condition of T2 cells, decide wether the selection is finished or not.
The Observation result shows that the fluorescent rate of GB(Cas9+EGFP) is high, and selection is almost finished.
But for GA, cells are still dying, everyday many cells round up, we still have keep selection with antibiotics.
Result
Figure 32. Image took under fluorescent microscope, at 9.1.
Dicussion
We disscused the our instructor, who give a hypothesis to explain the relative longer selection period of GA compare to GB. Which is the highly correlative transfection two plasmid by Lipofectamine.
So those have not transfected with resistance of puro usually have not resistance of bla, vice versa.  As a result puromycin helps to select cells with resistance of bla.
Sept 2nd
Prepare freezing preserve cells
To freeze cells, we have to expand our cells' population. As a result we passage each groups of cells from 1 petri dish to 2 10cm petri dishes.
Change medium
T2 cells.
For keep select T2 cells with fluorescence and resistance, we change medium to insure the concetration of antibiotics.
Fluorescence Observation
More cells in GA are expressing green fluorescence, compare to picture we took at Sept. 1.
Which indicate that the selection of antibiotics is still processing. We still have to keep working on the T2 cells.
Figure 33. GA GB pool cells Sept.3
Sept 3rd
Freezing T1 stable cells
As we have created and tested our newly constructed cell-line, we must prepare multiple frozen aliquots to ensure a renewable source of cells.
Before we start freezing, we took picture under fluorescent microscope.
Figure 34. G1 pool before freezing. This picture taken under microscope indicate that almost every cell has expressed green fluorescence.
Figure 35. G3 pool before freezing. This picture taken under microscope indicate that almost every cell has expressed green fluorescence.
Materials
10cm petri plate seeden with 5 groups of stable new cell-line.
DMSO
FBS
DMEM
Cryovials
Nalgene® Mr. Frosty® Freezing Container
Procedures
Rinse the plate twice with PBS to remove any floating cells and wash out all medium.
Trypsinize and pool all of the cells.
Centrifuge the cells at 800 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in freezing medium with pipette. Use 20% FBS, 70% DMEM, and 10% DMSO.
Dispense 1 ml aliquots into sterile cryovials and place vials in Nalgene frezing containers, and freeze at –80°C overnight.
The next day, remove the vials from the container, and place in liquid nitrogen storage for storage.
Result
After we place vials into container we forget to put container into -80°C, instead we place it at -20°C overnight. Experiment failed.
We have left a little fraction of cells seeding in T-25 flask. So we passage them to 10cm petri dish for expand and next freezing.
Pick monoclones
Clones on the plate for pick monoclones have grown into a big monoclone. So we pick up those clones and passage to 24-well-plate. Culture those monoclones and do experiment. Because monoclones have better stability.
Materials
Complete medium
200μl pipette tip
24-well-plate
PBS
Trypsin
PYREX™ Cloning Cylinders
Procedures
Procedure
Examine the culture dish containing well-isolated clones with a microscope. Locate those with a good condition considerable population.
Once satisfactory colonies have been located, draw a circle around them on the bottom of the dish with a marking pen. Select colonies that are of bigger size (bigger represent quicker growth rate) and well isolated from other colonies.
Remove and discard the growth medium. Rinse the plate twice with PBS to remove any floating cells and wash out all medium.
Using sterile tweezer pick up a cloning cylinder. Gently press the flat bottom of the cylinder into the sterile vaseline and remove with a sudden vertical motion. If done properly, this will give even distribution of grease on the bottom of the cylinder. Set the cylinder over a colony. Gently press the cylinder down evenly with the tweezer. Uneven pressure will cause the grease seal to leak. Be very careful not to slide the cylinder across the colony. This will smear the silicone grease over the cells and prevent the trypsin from contacting them.
Verify positioning of the cylinder over the colony with the microscope. Make sure there are no other colonies within the sealed area in the cylinder.
Add about 20μL of the 0.25% trypsin to the cloning cylinder.
Incubate the dish at 37°C for 3 minutes. Then examine cells under the microscope make sure that cells have been round up and come off the dish bottom. Add a few drops of growth medium to the cylinder and gently aspirate the cells with a pipette.
Transfer the cells to a suitable culture vessel and add the appropriate volume of medium. Colonies are seeded in well from a 24well plate. It may be necessary to rinse the cylinder with additional medium to remove cells left after the initial transfer.
Incubate cells as usual.

Flow Cytometry
We mearsured G1 G3 and wild-type HeLa cells, flow cytometer protocol is set based on wild-type
Materials
PBS
Trypsin
300 mesh filter
Complete medium
Flow Cytometry tubes 10*80
Backman Coulter Gallios
Protocol
Remove and discard the growth medium. Rinse the plate twice with 200μL PBS to remove any floating cells and wash out all medium.
Add about 100μL of the 0.25% trypsin to well in 24-well-plate, or 1ml to 10cm petri dish and aspirate after 30s.
Trypsinize 1-2min at 37°C
Add 400μL complete medium per well or 4ml per petri dish to neutrualize trypsin stop trypsinize.
Gently suspend with Pasteur tube or pepitte.
Pepite 500μL into EP tubes.
Centrifuge for 5min at 800rpm.
Aspirate supernatant and add 500μL PBS to suspend pellet filt with 300mesh filter.and pepite to Flow cytometry tubes. Mark well and carefully.
Result
We set protocol of flow cytometer was set by wild-type HeLa cells as blank.
Figure 41. The voltage of scensers is set according to ordinaty HeLa cells. The image shows the result.
Figure 42. This shows the green fluorescence of G1 cells, the sharp peak on the right side of picture represent 'almost every cells has fluorescence. In second chart Y axis represent the cell count, X axis represent green fluorescent intensity.
Figure 43. Same as G1, almost every G3 pool cell expresses green fluorescent protein.
Conclution
We can conclude from all those data above, that our new cell line, expressing green fluorescence is successfully construct. Both the pool cells and monoclones cells are stably transfected with EGFP gene.
It is perfect to use this cell line to have further expriement !
