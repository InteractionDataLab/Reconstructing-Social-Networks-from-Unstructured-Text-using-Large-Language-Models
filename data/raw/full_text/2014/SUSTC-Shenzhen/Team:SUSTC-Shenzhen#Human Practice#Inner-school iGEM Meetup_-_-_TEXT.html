Inner-school iGEM Meetup
There were about 100 new students (taking up over one quarter of total freshmen) coming to our meet up that day. All team members were at present to welcome them. We made a presentation to introduce synthetic biology, iGEM and our project to them and we also told them that we would be very glad if we could get help from them in Human Practice.
It’s the first time for most of them to know such terms like biobricks, CAS9, guide RNA and so on. They listened carefully and. After the presentation, many students showed great curiosity and interest. They asked us many questions and we answered them in detail.
After the meet up, many students stayed and asked for opportunities to join the iGEM team next year. There are two enthusiastic freshmen help us with human practice as volunteers.
