Plasmid
Full list of plasmid we used and constructed
Contents
1 gRNA-mCherry-NLS-UAS plasmids
2 Plasmids from Germany
3 Target-sequence
Here are the full list of plasmids we've used and constructed and their names and maps have universality.
gRNA-mCherry-NLS-UAS plasmids
Plasmids from Germany
pSW55-GD5 (partial) Uherek et al. 1998 Brief introduction: pSW55-GD5 encodes the chimeric fusion protein GD5 working as non-viral vector that can transfer specific target gene into specific target cells.
Contains: partial sequence (coding sequence) beginning with NdeI site (CATATG) vector backbone (not included): pFLAG-1, ompA signal peptide removed nt 4-1854: coding sequence GD5 fusion protein nt 7-30 FLAG peptide nt 37-54: 6 x His tag nt 55-492: GAL4 residues 2 to 147 (DNA binding domain) nt 505-1071 DT-B translocation domain nt 1093-1815: scFv(FRP5) (anti-ErbB2)

pWF47-TEG (partial) Fominaya et al. 1998 (corrected 2014-07-31) Brief introduction: pWF47-TEG encodes the chimeric fusion protein TEG working as non-viral vector that can transfer specific target gene into specific target cells.
partial sequence (coding sequence) beginning with second half of NdeI site (catATG) vector backbone (not included): pFLAG-1 nt 1-1089: coding sequence TEG fusion protein nt 1-63: ompA signal peptide (pFLAG-1) nt 64-87: FLAG peptide (pFLAG-1) nt 100-249: hTGFalpha residues 40 to 89 (mature form) nt 259-276: 6 x His tag nt 280-615: ETA domain II nt 628-1065: GAL4 residues 2 to 147 (DNA binding domain) nt 1078-1089: KDEL ER retention sequence
