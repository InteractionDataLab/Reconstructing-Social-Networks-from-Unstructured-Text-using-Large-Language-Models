3 Select gRNA sequences with the best theoretical quality
4 Reference
(Here we take HIV-1 as an example)
We used a method derived from the method described in the paper by Feng Zhang ZhangFgRNA .
Conserved Sequence Analysis
We first tried to extract all conserved regions from the NIH HIV-1 Reference Genome using BioEdit. In this step, we found around 10 alternatives for the next process. Here all screening processes are done in a per-strain basis because of the high mutability of the HIV-1 virus.

Table 1. Base-wise Statistics of One Designed Sequence
As we can see from Table 1, this sequence is highly conserved among about 50% of HIV-1 strains.
Strip out sequences without PAM
Sequences without PAM cannot bind with Cas9 protein and are thus of no use here. Thus we used a small JavaScript script to strip out them.

In this step, we used the tools from Feng Zhang and George Church to analyze off-target activity. Still, we did BLAST ourselves to verify the results.
We have selected gRNA sequences with the best theoretical quality using the experimental formula by Feng Zhang:  $$\prod_{e\in{\mathcal{M}}}\left(1-\space W[e]\right)\times\frac{1}{\left(\frac{(19\space-\space\bar{d})}{19}\times 4\space+\space 1\right)}\times\frac{1}{n^2_{mm}} \\ M=[0,0,0.014,0,0,0.395,0.317,0,0.389,0.079,0.445,\\ 0.508,0.613,0.851,0.732,0.828,0.615,0.804,0.685,0.583]$$
