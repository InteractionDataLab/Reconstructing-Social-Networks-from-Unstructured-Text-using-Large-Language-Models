Verification for plasmids
Follow-up for verification of plasmid PX330-MCherry-GAL4、PX330-MCherry (amplified on 2014.8.9) by restriction digestion
We decided to repeat the verification experiment for plasmid MCherry-GAL4-PX330、MCherry-PX330, since we had failed yesterday.
Methods
The same as yesterday’s verification experiment
Methods
Perform restriction digestion for plasmids MCherry-PX330（MCherry2-1、2-2、2-3, MCherry-GAL4-PX330（1-1、1-4）

Results of electrophoresis:
From the picture, we can see that, for those digested group, both of the two supposed bands (4200, 800bp) had appeared, which meant that the amplification for plasmids pX330-mCherry and pX330-GAL4-mCherry had succeeded.

From the picture, we can see that, G56-1and polyA56-1 only suffered one cut during the digestion, which implied the slight possibility of the success for Fill-in ( EcoRI site has been eliminated by fill-in).  Thus, we decided to perform further verifications for G56-1and polyA56-1.
