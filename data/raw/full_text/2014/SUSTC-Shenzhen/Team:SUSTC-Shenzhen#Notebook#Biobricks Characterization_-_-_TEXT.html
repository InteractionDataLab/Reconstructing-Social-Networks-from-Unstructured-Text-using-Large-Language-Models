Scheme
Team Uppsala 2012 chromoprotein attracts many interests because its more convenient than fluorescent protein to be use as a reporter. However, few characterized data can be found for these proteins. SUSTC-Shenzhen this year want to tackle with theses problems. At first, we want to characterize plasmid assembled by 3 promoters, 3 RBSs, and 4 chromoprotein (36). Because time limits, we choose 2 promoter, 2 RBSs and 4 chromoprotein (16). However, we found construction with E1010 is very hard because the promoter we used (J23100 & J23106) can express chromoprotein E1010, which makes it difficult and unnecessary to distinguish between these proteins. So we abandoned BBa_E1010 and do experiments on other chromoproteins.
Results
We successfully constructed 8 parts, and they all are characterized. And 6 parts were sent to Registry of Standard Biological Parts. See them | HERE .

Amplification of biobricks we would use. Our protocol is based on the iGEM Protocols:
Punch a hole into the corresponding hole in the hole in 2014 kit plate by a pipette tip. Adding 10ul ddH20 to the hole and pipette up and down for several times. Let sit for 7 min to make sure the dried DNA is fully resuspended.
Transform 3ul DNA into E. coli DH5α competent cell. Ice incubate for 30min.
42℃ heat shock for 90s, then ice incubate for 5min.
Adding 200ul SOC medium and shake at 200rpm for 50min.
Centrifuge 12000rpm for 2min. Discard 200ul supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in the rest 50ul medium. Then spread the plate with all 50ul broth.
37℃ incubate overnight. (19:27)
9.9
We observed the plate at 14:00 and found the bacteria on several plates were growing much faster than on the other plates. We then put the plates which has grown out colonies into the refrigerator in case of overgrowth and continued to incubate the rest plates at 37℃. At 19:00, we found that some plates in the incubator had grown out several colonies.
9.10
At 0:20, we picked up one colony for each plate and used shake incubator. B0015, B0030, K592011 and J04450 didn’t grown out. We redid the transformation and spreading the plate in the day time. We extracted plasmids (16:00), do the enzyme digestion (21:00) and do gel electrophoresis (23:50).
Gel electrophoresis results:
From the gel result, we could see that all plasmids were successfully double digested, and the plasmid size was correct.
9.11
We picked up the colonies of B0015, B0030, K592011 and J04450 at 19:00 and shake in the incubator overnight.
9.12
We extracted the plasmid (10:00) and do double enzyme digestion (18:10~23:10). Then we did gel electrophoresis to verify the results (23:49).
From the result we can conclude that all plasmids have been successfully amplified.
9.14
First we would link RBS with Chromoprotein by 3A assembly.
Enzyme digestion:
For RBS (B0031, B0034), using EcoRI-HF and SpeI to cut. For chromoprotein (E1010, K1033916, K592009, K592011), using XbaI and PstI to cut. For the plasmid backbone (I20260, Kana resistance), using EcoRI-HF and PstI.

Transformation: Using 5ul ligation product and 50ul competent cell. Heat shock 90s and revive for 2h. Centrifuge and concentrate the broth before spreading the plate (20:00~23:00).
9.15~9.17
The plate grow out with a lot of false colonies (with green fluorescence due to GFP in I20260). We doubt that it was due to the enzyme digestion efficiency and strong self ligation, so we tried to do enzyme digestion and ligation again with the linearized plasmid provided by Parts Registry in 2014 kit. We also recalculated the molar ratio of RBS, chromoprotein and plasmid backbone and try to make it into 10:3:1.

Then we did the transformation as the normal protocol.
9.18~9.22
We did the plasmid backbone recovery and competent cell efficiency test, but we failed. We also picked up several colonies on the first ligation and transformation plate and incubate it in LB broth medium, but we also failed. We thought it’s due to the low efficiency of 3A assembly, so we changed our plan to traditional assembly: cut and recover chromoprotein from digested system and ligate it into RBS backbone.
For the molar ration, most chromoprotein is 700bp long and the RBS backbone is 2100bp long. If we want the molar ratio of chromoprotein:RBS backbone = 3:1, we should add exact same mass of chromoprotein and RBS backbone.
9.23~9.25
We failed again
No colony formed again. We thought the most likely reason is our competent cells. So we try to repeat the experiments again with the competent cells of our teacher’s.
9.26~9.28
Fortunately, 8 plates we incubate grew out many colonies, and we picked up single colonies from each plate to amplify and extract the plasmids. Then we did enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis to verify the results.
From the result we could see that all plasmids except for B31+K11 are constructed successfully.
9.29
After RBS added, all seven plasmid were cut and ligated with two promoter, J23101 and J23106 respectively.

Transformation with DH5α
10.9
I.Bacteria with 3A assembly plasmid grow so much slowly.
II. Transformation (10.8) was done with DH5α, we have to do again with BL21.
III.Broth culture, plasmid extraction and storage of complete plasmid J00 B34 K09+T, J00 B34K916+T, J06 B34 K09+T, J06 B34 K916+T and J06 B31 K916+T. And extra broth were sent to be sequenced. Unfortunately, EP tubes of J00 B34 K916+T and J06 B31 K916+T were mixed. We recovered broth culture and reinoculated 200μL to 3mL LB Broth, and do extraction again.
V.Plasmid extraction of J06 B31 K916 (without terminator).

Transformation：First five with BL21, J06 B34 K11+T with DH5α.
VI.Because plasmid constructed with BBa_E1010 is difficult to be differed with J04450, we decided to abandon construction those with BBa_E1010.

II. Plates of J06 B31 K11, J06 B31 K09, J00 B31 K916 and B0015 grew no colonies.
III. Plates of J06 B34 K11+T (10.9 VI) grew single green colonies one of which was isolated and transfer to broth, and plasmid was extracted at night.
IV. Ligations for J06 B31 K09 and J06 B31 K11 were redid.

III. Plasmid extraction
IV. Plates of J00 B31 K09 and J00 B31 K11 is not distinct, we decided to abandon these constructions.
Characterization
10.15~10.16
All 8 biobricks were transformed into BL21 and spread plates. We take pictures for several hours. And single colonies are isolated into LB broth for testing under spectrometer.
