AIDS Ice Bucket Challenge
What is it?

1 Script
2 Preparation
3 Further
Script
Scene 1: An HIV virus find a CD4+ T cell. The virus attacks the CD4+ T and kidnaps it.
Scene 2: The A-part of AB-toxin carrying CRISPR/Cas9 System and gRNA designed for the kidnapped CD4+ T comes to rescue. The gRNA helps Crisper system recognize the specific HIV virus and tear it up by a bucket of ice water.
Scene 3: The CD4+ T cell is protected by CRISPR/Cas9 System. But a mutated HIV comes again. The previous gRNA can’t recognize it again. The A-part of AB-toxin carrying the newly designed gRNA shows up to rescue the poor CD4+ T cell again and defeat the virus again.
Preparation
To ensure the challenge would go smoothly and the stardom could go back to lab next day, we prepared buckets full of ice water and a towel for everyone in advance. Once someone got wet, a towel would be given to him. The video was recorded by four different cameras at different places and clipped into this version you see.
Further
In this 3-minute video, we show the core mechanism of our project. We hope it can help the public to know more about our thoughts and gene therapy. Of course it’s also an excellent way for the team members to relax. We got it ready in September but decided to publish it with our wiki. So we are here to @you to watch our video and send the link to everyone you know.
