Requirements For All Teams
1.Team Composition
iGEM teams consist primarily of undergraduate students at an accredited college or university. The team must be supervised by at least two instructors one of whom must be a faculty member. Both instructors must serve as primary contacts and are responsible for the official registration of the team, the team roster, certifying the safety form, and payment of team fees. Graduate students, postdocs, and others are welcome as team advisors on undergraduate teams. In the overgraduate section, graduate students, students over the age of 23 (on March 31, 2014), and other interested parties are eligible to compete on the team as student team members.
2.Team Structure
One team pays one registration fee, has one presentation at the Jamboree, one poster, and is eligible for one set of prizes. Several schools may combine to form a team and a school may have several teams. In particular, it is normal for a school to have both Software and Wetware teams.
3.Registration and Other Fees:
Team registration: A $3500 USD team registration fee is required for each team. Giant Jamboree attendance fees: attendance fees for the Giant Jamboree in Boston are $750 per attendee.
4.Project Documentation:
The team's project must be documented on the iGEM Wiki, the parts used in their project must be documented in the Registry. You have the freedom to be creative, but a few specific rules apply.
5.Part Submission:
We didn’t contribute parts to the Registry ,but we complete the submission of our complete source code and any auxiliary files to the iGEM github repository.
6.Attribution:
The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the Students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, Advisors, Instructors, technicians, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
7.Safety:
Teams are required to complete the About Our Lab form, the Safety Form, and Check-Ins. The team PI (principal investigator) is responsible for attesting to the validity of the Safety Form contents and for submitting the form. See the Safety Hub for details and applicable deadlines.
8.Project Presentation:
All team members are encouraged to attend the Giant Jamboree in October/November 2014. Each team will give a 20 minute presentation and present a poster of their project. Oral and poster presentations must be given by the students. Final pdf files of the posters must be submitted to iGEM HQ before or during the Jamboree weekend.
9.Positive Contribution:
All participants are required to work hard to build positive contributions to society and have lots of fun!
Requirements For Software Track
1.End User Documentation
Core requirements are:
Wiki documentation of project aims, methods and success -- in line with the general iGEM requirements
Detailed installation or setup instructions (if applicable)
An well-designed User Guide explaining how to use of your program or tool
2.Re-Use and Best software development practices
Core requirements are:
Submission of your complete source code and any auxiliary files to the iGEM github repository
Use git versioninig from the start of your project so that the commit history is / will be available on github
Comprehensive code documentation for outside developers
Highly recommended:
More than one realistic test case
Automated unit tests, documentation of test coverage
API documentation, preferably automatically built from source code documentation
Bonus points for:
Use of SBOL and other standards
Re-use and further development of previous iGEM software projects (or parts thereof)
Use and/or improvement of existing synthetic biology tools or frameworks
development of well documented libraries for other developers rather than "only" stand-alone Apps for end users
3.Relevance and Validation
Core requirements are:
Demonstrate the relevance of your development for Synthetic Biolgy
Highly recommended:
Devise an experimental test for your program/algorithm/work flow
The experimental validation of software/computational projects is not expected to result in a super fancy engineering project. Instead we would like to see simple and straightforward experiments (for example: gene synthesis, expression, fluorescence of x constructs) which can be delegated to external labs or collaborating teams. iGEM/software will try to support teams who want to outsource experimental testing to academic or commercial labs. Details will follow.
