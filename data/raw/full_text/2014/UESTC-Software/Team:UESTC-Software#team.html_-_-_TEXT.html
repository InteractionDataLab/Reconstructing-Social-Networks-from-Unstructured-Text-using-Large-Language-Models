Instructors
Huang Jian
Jian Huang holds M.D. degree with experience in medicine, basic immunology and bioinformatics from the West China University of Medical Sciences and the Kyoto University. His studies focus on the molecular aspects of antigens, antibodies and peptide aptamers. His work has resulted in the development of a few immunological databases and web programs which have become to be important tools and data resources for both computational biologists and experimental biologists, especially those using phage display technology. Dr. Huang has also been an Editorial Board Member for several peer-reviewed journals such as Scientific Reports.
Guo Fengbiao
Feng-Biao Guo finished his doctorial study in TianJin University in February 2006. Now he is a full professor and Ph.D. supervisor of Bioinformatics at UESTC. His research interests currently focus on computational, comparative, evolutionary and functional genomics of microbes. He has published over 40 peer-reviewed papers in international journals. ZCURVE 1.0, which is one of the softwares developed by him, has been used in about 100 laboratories or institutes all over the world. In 2012 has selected into the project of the new century excellent talents of Education Ministry and earned the Young Teachers of Henry Fok Educational Foundation.

Academic Support
We’d like to express our gratitude to Dr. Feng Zhang, his previous study and papers really inspired us.
A special thanks to CRISPR-P, we have learned a lot from this software.
Support from Friends
Special thanks to Yuning Gu, Zhiyi Li and Jiao Li for taking group picture and work photos for us, to Tiantian Gao for making wonderful gifs to help us presenting our project, to Zhihui Peng who had to leave our team halfway for some reasons for making amazing homemade mobile phone microscopes.
Others
During the whole prepare phase, we had regular meetings to discuss and deal with problems. All project has been independently presented by the entire UESTC-Software iGEM team including student members and instructors. We completed all work such as modeling, programming, document writing, validation, wiki implementing, art design and human practice on our own.
