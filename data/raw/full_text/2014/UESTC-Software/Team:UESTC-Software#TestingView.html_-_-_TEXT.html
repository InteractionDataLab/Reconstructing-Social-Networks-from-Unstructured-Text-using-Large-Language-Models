TEST REPORT
Version <1.2>
<10/13/2014>
VERSION HISTORY
In versions before v1.2, we did informal interior test report in Chinese, which helps us track bugs in our
project. In version 1.2, we provide detailed test report.

3.0 TEST ASSESSMENT
This version of test report, we focus on our server performance to illegal query.
And in these test cases, we integrate with coverall.io to evaluate our test coverage.
As these above test cases show, the query attributes which users manually fill, on
boundary, our server response with null sgRNA results. But no alarm for these
illegal query. This part of test cases aren’t passed. Most badly, we found some
fatal error, the deadlock! Multi threads enhance program efficiency, but sometimes
this unpredictable. In fellow work, we need check our semaphore control, and
keep  our  program  more  safety.  Through  these  test  cases,  our  test  coverage
increased  to
83%, in details please check our reference
1. And all detailed
automatic test process can be found under reference 2.

No alarm message.
Query in json:

No alarm message.
Query in json:
'{"specie":"Saccharomyces-cerevisiae","location":"NC_001135-

Deadlock.
7.0 RECOMMENDATIONS
Provide alarm message for every type of illegal queries.  And check the thread
synchronization carefully, avoiding deadlock.
