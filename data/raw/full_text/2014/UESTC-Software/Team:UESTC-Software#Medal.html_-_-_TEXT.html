UESTC-Software
Gold Medal
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, two additional goals must be achieved:
1.Provide a convincing validation, testing the performance of the development -- experimentally (can be outsourced) or by other teams and users. Note, even if the algorithm or tool turns out not to work that well, the Gold requirement is fulfilled if the test is good and the analysis convincing. Validation may include: preferably experiments, informatics analysis (complexity, run time) of an algorithm, or user studies.
We have provided a convincing validation in the validation of our wiki. https://2014.igem.org/Team:UESTC-Software/Validation.html
And the second goal can be any one of the following:
1.Make your software interact / interface with the Registry.
2.Re-use and further develop previous iGEM software projects (or parts thereof) or use and/or improvement of existing synthetic biology tools or frameworks.
3.Develop a well documented library or API for other developers (rather than “only” a stand-alone app for end users.)
Please visit https://2014.igem.org/Team:UESTC-Software/API.html .
4.Support and use the SBOL and / or SBOLv standard.
5.iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.
Silver Medal
1.Demonstrate the relevance of your development for Synthetic Biology based on standard Parts.
We have demonstrated the relevance of our development for Synthetic Biology based on standard Parts in the overview of our wiki. Please visit https://2014.igem.org/Team:UESTC-Software/Overview.html .
2.Provide a comprehensive and well-designed User Guide. (Be creative! An instructional video may work as well.)
Please visit https://2014.igem.org/Team:UESTC-Software/UserGuide.html
3.Provide detailed API documentation, preferably, automatically built from source code documentation (use tools like doxygen, yard, rdoc, naturaldocs, etc).
Please visit https://2014.igem.org/Team:UESTC-Software/API.html .
4.Demonstrate that you followed best practises in software development so that other developers can modify, use and reuse your code. Provide more than one realistic test case. Examples of best practices are automated unit testing and documentation of test coverage bug tracking facilities, documentation of releases and changes between releases.
We used many modern software CI, such as Travis CI and coveralls. In details, please visit https://2014.igem.org/Team:UESTC-Software/Overview.html#p6
Bronze Medal
1.Register the team, have a great summer, and have fun attending the Jamboree in Boston.
2.Create and share a description of the team's project via the iGEM wiki.
3.Present a Poster and Talk at the Regional Jamboree and World Championship Jamboree.
4.Develop and make available via The Registry of Software Tools, an open source software tool that supports Synthetic Biology based on Standard Parts.
Our software supports RFC [10], RFC [12], RFC [21], RFC [23] and RFC [25].
