Game: Bacteria war</DIV><P>One day, a group of unknown viruses invaded the tribe of bacteria, bacteria have fought off waves of enemies, but it seems that the war will still last...</P><P>There are four kinds of viruses, and each kind of viruses will cause different damage. The aim of the game is to help bacteria resisting the viruses and winning the victory of the battle. And you can update your bacteria after one level cleared.</P><P>‘Bacteria War’ is developed based on android platform. The develop progress is a little difficult but enjoyable. We created the setting, roles and game rules on our own and we are keeping improving the game. For example, players can control the bacteria only by accelerometer at first.  But now, players can also control it by joystick. </P><P>We have learned from some similar games during the develop process. We’d like to give our great gratitude to predecessors.</P><P>When a player open the game, he’ll see a brief introduction of iGEM in the home page.That’s why we developed the game. We’d like to let more people know about iGEM and synthetic biology.</P></DIV><DIV class="parts" style="padding: 20px 50px 20px 100px;"><DIV class="question" id="p2">Part B.Introductory videos</DIV><P>CRISPR may be an unfamiliar field for most ordinary people. In order to make it easier to understand and get more people to know about synthetic biology and iGEM, we made some short introductory videos.</P><P>In the first video, we’d like to give a brief description of our project. And the next two videos are about the desktop version and android version of CRISPR-X. Please check out and you will have a preliminary understanding of our software.</P><P> Wish you will also be attracted by synthetic biology!</P><P>If you can’t see the video, maybe you can try to click on the links below to view them on Youku.</P><P>Brief introduction of the whole project: <A href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNzU1MTM3NzUy.html">Video 1</A>. </P><P>Desktop version of CRISPR-X: <A href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNzU0ODcwNTQ4.html">Video 2</A>. </P><P>Android version of CRISPR-X: <A href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNzU0ODcxMDY0.html">Video 3</A>. </P></DIV><DIV class="parts" style="padding: 20px 50px 20px 100px;"><DIV class="question" id="p3">Part C.High school visit and lecture</DIV><P>On April 29, we visited Chengdu No.7 senior high school, which is the best high school in Chengdu. We made a lecture about the iGEM and synthetic biology. Before the visit, we prepared eye-catching posters and organized slide for the sake of making it easier to understand.</P><P>First of all, as the representative of our team, Wu Yaoming gave a brief introduction about iGEM to the high school students, especially about the software track. Then, Chenxin explained some concepts of synthetic biology which aroused their high motivation to try it. Finally, several teammates went to the stage to describe the general destination of our software. The picture shows below is about making an introduction about iGEM by Wu.</P><P>Gratifyingly, during the lecture, the high school students focused attention to the task we were dedicated in and showed great enthusiasm about the competition. The objective of human practice is to make more people familiar with synthetic biology, now we were out of the first step.</P><P>After the lecture, we were surrounded by the students, well, also by their questions. Our earnest teammates explained them in detail one by one. Our uniform called ‘facebook’ is inspired by the Face off in Sichuan Opera. It conveyed our wishes: We wish the iGEM will be more far-reaching in not only UESTC but also high schools in Chengdu. We wore it while the students wore their school uniforms. And they will be the important scientific and technological manpower in the future!</P><P>Before our leaving, we took photos with the high school students. This was a wonderful and meaningful visit. Just like what the banner says, we wish the synthetic biology to be a part of our life! So, join us!</P></DIV><DIV class="parts" style="padding: 20px 50px 20px 100px;"><DIV class="question" id="p4">Part D. Communication with other iGEM teams</DIV><P>On July 25th 2014, we communicated with the SCU-China iGEM team and the UESTC-China iGEM team in our school. We discussed some issues we encountered in the preparation progress and drew on each other’s experience.</P><P>After that, we visited the laboratory where the UESTC-China worked in summer and we knew some knowledge about biological experiment which inspired us a lot in the software test we were going to work on.</P><P>After the short but meaningful communication, we knew more about each other and we also found our shortcomings form comparison.</P><P>See you in Boston! </P></DIV><DIV class="parts" style="padding: 20px 50px 20px 100px;"><DIV class="question" id="p5">Part E. Open Day</DIV><P>On October 15th, in order to promote our software and Bacteria War, we organized ‘Open Day’.</P><P>This activity consists of two parts. One is opening our training base to the whole school. We showed visitors the function of CRISPR-X and how to use it. Then the visitors played ‘Bacteria War’ and they were filled with excitement to compare the score with others.</P><P>Another part is going to student dormitories to make a brief introduction of CRISPR and iGEM because most students are unfamiliar with CRISPR. They also played ‘Bacteria War’ and appreciated our software and game very much. Before our leaving, they congratulated us beforehand on our success.</P><P>The response to this activity was tremendous. We were glad to find that many students knew about iGEM. To extend the influence of iGEM and synthetic biology, we are always in action.</P></DIV><DIV class="leftMenu"><DIV id="go1" class="go" style="width: 80px;text-align: left;">Game</DIV><DIV id="go2" class="go" style="width: 120px;text-align: left;">Introductory videos</DIV><DIV id="go3" class="go" style="width: 80px;text-align: left;">High school visit</DIV><DIV id="go4" class="go" style="width: 140px;text-align: left;">Communication</DIV><DIV id="go5" class="go" style="width: 80px;text-align: left;">Open Day</DIV></DIV><DIV class="navbar"><UL class="leftUl UL"><LI><A href="Overview.html">Overview</A></LI><LI><A href="Modeling.html">Modeling</A></LI><LI><A href="Demo.html">Demo</A></LI><LI><A href="Validation.html">Validation</A></LI><LI><A href="Download.html">Download</A></LI><LI><A href="safety.html">Safety</A></LI></UL><UL class="rightUl UL"><LI><A href="journal.html">Journal</A></LI><LI><A href="HumanPractice.html">Human Practice</A></LI></UL><LI><A href="Requirement.html">Requirements</A></LI><LI><A href="Medal.html">Medal Fulfillment</A></LI><LI><A href="API.html">API Documentation</A></LI><LI><A href="Testing.html">Testing Documentation</A></LI><LI><A href="Installation.html">Installation</A></LI><LI><A href="UserGuide.html">User Guide</A></LI></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
