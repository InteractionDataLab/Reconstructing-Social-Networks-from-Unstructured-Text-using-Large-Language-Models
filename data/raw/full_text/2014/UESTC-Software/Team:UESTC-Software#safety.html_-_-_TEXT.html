About Our Lab
1. a) Does your country use a four-part "Safety Level" rating system for laboratories?
Yes. Level 4 is used for the most dangerous organisms. (True for most countries in Asia, the European Union, and North/South America. This is equivalent to the WHO system.)
b) What is the Safety Level of your lab?
 Our team is not doing any wet-lab work  (e.g. Policy & Practices Track, some teams in Software Track)
2. a) What type of work environments do you use to handle biological materials? Please check all that apply. 
Our team is not doing any wet-lab work (e.g. Policy & Practices Track, some teams in Software Track)
b) Do you handle different materials in different work environments? If yes, please describe what materials you handle in what work environments.
No.
3. a) What personal protective equipment do you use in your lab? Please check all that apply.
We do not know how to describe our protective equipment (please comment):     Because we won't do any wet-lab work,so we don't take protective equipment into account.
We do not know how to describe our protective equipment (please comment):     Because we won't do any wet-lab work,so we don't take protective equipment into account.
No.
4. How do you dispose of biological waste? (For example: liquid cell cultures, agar plates, used pipette tips.)
Sorry.All of our job will be finished with computer,so we think we won't produce biological waste.

1. Your Training
a) Have your team members received any safety training yet?
Yes, we have already received safety training.
b) Please briefly describe the topics that you learned about (or will learn about) in your safety training.
Normal experimental technique in microbiology and molecular biology for undergraduate student.
c) Please give a link to the laboratory safety training requirements of your institution (college, university, community lab, etc). Or, if you cannot give a link, briefly describe the requirements.

2. Your Local Rules and Regulations
a) Who is responsible for biological safety at your institution? Have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised, and any changes you made in your project based on your discussion.
The professors who are responsible for the lab.Yes,we have discussed our project with them. Our project will do little biological experiments,there is no danger in the lab,so we do not have concerns.
b) What are the biosafety guidelines of your institution? Please give a link to these guidelines, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.
http://www.life.uestc.edu.cn/
c) In your country, what are the regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories? Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.

3. The Organisms and Parts that You Use
Complete the spreadsheet. Include all whole organisms that you will handle in the lab, whether you are using them as a chassis or for some other reason. Include all new or highly modified protein coding parts that you are using. If you submitted a Check-In for an organism or part, you should still include it in this spreadsheet.

4. Risks of Your Project Now
a) Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
No any risks to the health of members and people working in the lab.
b) Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):
No.Any part in our project does not contain such operation.
c) Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
No.Our experiment won't produce such risks.
d) Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
No.Because of the characteristic of our project,that will not happen.
e) What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
As described,all of our job will be accomplished with computer, we have not taken such measures.
5. Risks of Your Project in the Future
a) What new risks might arise from your project's growth? Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
No.If our dream come true,the users do not need to do any experiment,so no risks might arise.
b) Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
No.
6. Further Comments
If you are completing a Preliminary Version of your Safety Form, use this space to describe how far you have progressed in your project, and give some comments about any questions that you left blank. You can also use this space for any other comments or additional material.
We had a wonderful beginning,and we are making improvement of the project now.
