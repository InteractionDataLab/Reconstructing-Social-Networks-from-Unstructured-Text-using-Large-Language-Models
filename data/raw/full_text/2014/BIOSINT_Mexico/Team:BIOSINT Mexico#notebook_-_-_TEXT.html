NOTEBOOK
Welcome to our records, here you will find both the date to date calendar- since the summer until this month- and the sketch of all the protocols considered in this project. We included daily  record of our laboratory work per month. Our numerous team has come together since september 2013 and have been laboring since then: coming up with the theoretical work, designing our parts,  gathering our materials and getting in touch with potential sponsors. This summarizes primordially our wet lab experiences.
