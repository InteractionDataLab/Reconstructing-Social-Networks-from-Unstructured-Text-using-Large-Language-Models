On the so celebrated biotechnologist day in our campus, we organized an activity to know the artistic ideas of synthetic biology that our peers had about this subject. Participants were asked to portrait  what they thought synthetic biology was about and what it could be used for.
Colorful images and shaded biobricks covered our paper band that day, including the famous double helix, which could be observed crossing our  improvised canvas.
This challenge where science is explored through arts  has provided the opportunity of allowing the ideas of synthetic biology applications to spread out unjudged. Where the impossible and possible recombine into creativity, that could potentially one day be an iGEM project.
We provided an unbiased space for the participants explore their perceptions, in the hope that they can open up to this new technology and that the curiosity that they could  have developed, through artistic expression on this matter, will help them enjoy and try out the exciting world of synthetic biology.
