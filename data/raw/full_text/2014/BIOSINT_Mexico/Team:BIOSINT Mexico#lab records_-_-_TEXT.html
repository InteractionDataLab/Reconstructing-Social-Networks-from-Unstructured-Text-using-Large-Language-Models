Transformation of E.coli with [RBS-PhyB-AGS-VP16-NLS-PolyA]
Procedure:
*50 µl of competent cells were placed in a cold eppendorf tube
*10 µl of DNA sample were added
*It was mixed gently and left incubating in ice for 30 minutes
*The tube was put through heat shock in water at 42⁰c for 60 seconds
*The tube was placed in ice for 5 minutes
*200 µl of S.O.C. were added
*The tube was left incubating for 2 hour at 37⁰c and 120 rpm
*A dish with LB agar and Kanamycin (35mg/ml) was striated with the transformed cells
*The dish was sealed and left incubating at 37⁰c
