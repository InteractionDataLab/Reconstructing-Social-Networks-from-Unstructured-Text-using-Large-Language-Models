ACHIEVEMENTS
Achievements are an important part of any iGEM project because it summaries all the effort the team had to put in order to get where they are. The goals our team set up at the beginning, have been accomplished and in this section we explain and also give credit to people that helped us. Also highlight the most outstanding results that were obtained across an entire year of hard work. We are really happy to share all the achievements from our team.
