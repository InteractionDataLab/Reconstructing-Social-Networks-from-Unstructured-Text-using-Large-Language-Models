This year our work was mainly about science diffusion and awareness through interactive activities. Our team collaborated with four teams in the discovery of synthetic biology acceptance through surveys, partnered with a team to mathematically model part of their project, helped characterize the promoter of another team, organized a symposium to give a taste of synbio and biological systems applications for our community and opened a space for the artistic expression of students to draw their perception on synthetic biology
