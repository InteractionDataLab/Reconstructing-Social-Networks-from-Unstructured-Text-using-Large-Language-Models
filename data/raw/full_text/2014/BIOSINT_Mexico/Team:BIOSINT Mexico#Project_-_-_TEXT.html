This year we have designed a modular and plastic system, to detect and attack heavy metal soil pollution. The mechanism is ready to incorporate into Arabidopsis thaliana; previously described as a chassis in iGEM. Our project is describes as an alternative treatment for large areas of contaminated soil.
The project was developed in three modules
Bioaccumulation: The first module consists in the incorporation of metals to the cell, specifically mercury .
Sensor: The second module is a biosensor that uses a degreening system, which will allow us to notice the mercury in the soil.
Light Switch: The last module is base on  a 640 nm light switch, that stops the degreening system which allow the plant to survive with a big amount of mercury into its cells.
