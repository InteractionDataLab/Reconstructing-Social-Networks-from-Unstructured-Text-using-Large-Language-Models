The Researchers
Wade Dugdale (Photographer)
Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology and Marine Biology Undergraduate
Originally from Ojai, California
Why are you at UCSC?
"The diversity of current research and studies in the sciences and the arts here at UCSC was what drew me to study here, and the stunning campus drew me to live here. I don't want to leave!."
What do you like to do outside the lab?
"I love to SCUBA dive and sail here in the Monterey Bay. I also enjoy photography, and hiking here in Santa Cruz provides certainly plenty of unique photo opportunities!"
Stanislav "Stas" Fridland
Biomolecular Engineering Undergraduate
Originally from San Francisco, CA
What interested you about iGem?
"IGEM represents a collaborative effort between undergraduates from a variety of fields, aimed towards developing synthetic biology in a standardized and accessible way. This is something that I wanted to be a part of. "
What do you like to do outside the lab?
"I enjoy spending time outdoors, hiking and especially snowboarding. I try to get out to the mountains whenever I get the chance. I also enjoy volunteering my time to help others. The past two summers I have spent time in Costa Rica and Nicaragua working in health clinics in impoverished communities."
Maximilian "Max" Genetti
Biomolecular Engineering Undergraduate
with a Bioinformatics minor
Originally from Los Gatos, California
Why are you at UCSC?
"Since my first biology class I have always been fascinated with genetics.  It was when I was applying to colleges that I learned about how UCSC was involved with the Human Genome Project and what it was continuing to do with bioinformatics and single molecule detection that that I knew it was where I needed to go."
What do you like to do outside the lab?
"Scuba Diving is the best hobby I ever picked up.  Everything from exploring the ocean at 60 feet down, navigating kelp forests, getting followed by sea lions, and struggling out of a cold wetsuit are all part of why I do it."
Renee Jocic (Captain)
Biology Undergraduate
Originally from Rancho Palos Verdes, CA
What interested you about iGem?
"I have always been intrigued by synthetic biology's potential to develop alternative fuels. iGem gave me the opportunity to participate in the experimental design of biofuel production and experience research. iGem enables hands-on experience and learning in a lab setting. In the future, I intend to dedicate myself to alleviating the world's energy problems."
What do you like to do outside the lab?
"I enjoy kickboxing, yoga and video games. I am a fan of the "Game of Thrones" series and classic novels by Hemingway and Fitzgerald."
Christopher "Chris" Lee
Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Undergraduate
Computer Science minor
Bioinformatics minor
Originally from Riverside, California
What interested you about iGem?
"I wanted to join the iGEM after informally participating in last years project as a consultant. In addition, synthetic biology has been a  rather small part of my time here at UCSC, and iGEM presented a  perfect opportunity to learn more about it as a field."
What do you like to do outside the lab?
"My main hobbies include powerlifting and basketball, as well as discussing  general health and nutrition."
Jazel Hernandez
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Undergraduate
Originally from Gonzales, California
Why are you at UCSC?
"I am currently a sophomore at Hartnell Community College in Salinas, CA but I came to UCSC for a summer internship opportunity with iGEM. I do plan to attend UCSC in the Fall of 2015, and I chose Santa Cruz because I really like the research that the university has and its a beautiful campus."
What do you like to do outside the lab?
"I enjoy cooking and eating along with spending time with family and friends. I like going to the beach and walking along the shore looking for pretty shells. I also enjoy horseback riding and swimming."
Mary "Lenore" Pafford (Webmaster)
Bioinformatics Undergraduate
Originally from College Park, Maryland
Why are you at UCSC?
"My senior year of high school I was Googling tools to teach myself more about genetics, and I found the UCSC Human Genome Browser. Further research showed me both the school and the major of bioinformatics. It quickly became my first choice school."
What do you like to do outside the lab?
"I enjoy handy work, like carpentry, a skill I learned volunteering for Habitat for Humanity. This interest includes a deep desire to improve current construction materials and methods. This winter quarter at UCSC I even had the opportunity to give a technical presentation on my favorite subject: alternative toilets."
Rolando Cruz Perez (Captain)
Biomolecular Engineering Undergraduate
Originally from Salinas, California
What are your plans for the future?
"I plan to attend graduate school immediately after graduating from UCSC. My research interests lie at the interface of synthetic biology and nanotechnology, my longterm goal is to be a professor or entrepreneur conducting research in this area."
What do you like to do outside the lab?
"Admiring Nature's handiwork, great food, the company of family and friends, are all essentials that balance me. I have recently picked up a surfboard and it has proven to be therapeutic, as well as conducive to my learning."
Vinay Poodari
Biomolecular Engineering Undergraduate
Originally from San Jose, California
Why are you at UCSC?
"I was stunned by the natural beauty of the campus when I was deciding on colleges during my senior year, and decided to go to UCSC."
What do you like to do outside the lab?
"I enjoy biking with friends."
Dominic "Dom" Schenone (Lab Scribe)
Biomolecular Engineering and Electrical Engineering Undergraduate
Originally from Etna, California
Why are you at UCSC?
"I am interested in both robotics and synthetic biology. When looking for colleges I learnt of UCSC’s bioengineering program and their large impact on genetics and biology; particularly the Human Genome Project. When I visited the campus I fell in love with the atmosphere and the area."
What do you like to do outside the lab?
"I enjoy sailing on my Catamaran and have been an avid Skier all my life.  I also love my job as a tutor of both math and chemistry and like to help out students acclimating to college classes and workload"
Saumya Singh (Safety Officer)
Biomolecular Engineering Undergraduate
Originally from San Jose, California
What interested you about iGem?
"I wanted to work on a diverse team in order to tackle a world problem, especially one which would lead to a greener future."
What do you like to do outside the lab? "I enjoy hiking, camping, rock climbing."
Kevin Sweeney
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Undergraduate
Originally from San Jose, California
What interested you about iGem?
"I think iGEM is a great opportunity to pursue original research at such an early stage in our careers. As an undergraduate, there aren't many opportunities like it, and I think having the freedom to investigate our own ideas and theories will add greatly to the scientific community."
What do you like to do outside the lab? "My favorite personal hobbies are fitness and cooking. If I'm not working or studying for class, there's a good chance I'm either in the gym or the kitchen. I want to be as strong as I can be both mentally and physically, and that involves working hard at the gym when I'm not working in the lab, and meeting my nutritional goals in new and interesting ways whenever I can."
Kaylee Walker (Lab Manager)
Biomolecular Engineering Undergraduate
Originally from Los Osos, California
What interested you about iGem?
"iGEM gives a unique opportunity to become involved as an undergraduate in all areas of a research undertaking, from planning and fundraising to wet lab work; in our case, we are also striving to create a sustainably sourced biofuel, a topic of great interest and relevance."
What do you like to do outside the lab?
"Outside of school, I enjoy art and music; specifically, I play the accordion and piano and try my hand at scientific and naturalist illustration."
Paige Welsh (Science Communications)
Marine Biology Undergraduate
Literature minor
Originally from San Jose, California
What interested you about iGem?
"I enjoy creating media, whether it's writing articles, drawing logos, or making videos. I'm happy to work on a team where I can make some important science on climate change accessible for everyone."
What do you like to do outside the lab? "I love to scuba dive. Right now I'm amassing a collection of video and photos with my GoPro. I also work on a few extended creative writing projects. Hopefully I'll start sending some to publishers by the end of the year."
