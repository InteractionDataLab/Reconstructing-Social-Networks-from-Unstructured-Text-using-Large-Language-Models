Our team primarily worked with E. Coli and H.Volcanii which were Biosafety level 1.
The team mostly used standard protective equipment. This included gloves, goggles, and lab coats.
All members of iGEM were completed safety training which included information about the location
of fire alarm pull stations, safety showers, and fume hoods.
Participants also completed online EH & S Safety Training.
Team members were required to know how to properly store and dispose of hazardous chemicals.
The team had a few lab decorations as well.
