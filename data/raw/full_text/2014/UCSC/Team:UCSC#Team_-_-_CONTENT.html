Further research showed me both the school and the major of bioinformatics. It quickly became my first choice school.&quot;</P><P><B>What do you like to do outside the lab?</B></P><P>&quot;I enjoy handy work, like carpentry, a skill I learned volunteering for Habitat for Humanity.
This interest includes a deep desire to improve current construction materials and methods. This winter quarter at UCSC I even had the opportunity to give a technical presentation on my favorite subject: alternative toilets.&quot; </P><DIV id="wrapperBio"><P><B><MYH3>Rolando Cruz Perez (Captain)</MYH3></B>Biomolecular Engineering Undergraduate</P><P> Originally from Salinas, California</P><P><B>What are your plans for the future?</B></P><P> &quot;I plan to attend graduate school immediately after graduating from UCSC. My research interests lie at the interface of synthetic biology and nanotechnology, my longterm goal is to be a professor or entrepreneur conducting research in this area.&quot;</P><P><B>What do you like to do outside the lab?</B></P><P> &quot;Admiring Nature's handiwork, great food, the company of family and friends, are all essentials that balance me. I have recently picked up a surfboard and it has proven to be therapeutic, as well as conducive to my learning.&quot; </P></DIV><P><B><MYH3>Vinay Poodari</MYH3></B>Biomolecular Engineering Undergraduate</P><P> Originally from San Jose, California</P><P><B>Why are you at UCSC?</B></P><P> &quot;I was stunned by the natural beauty of the campus when I was deciding on colleges during my senior year, and decided to go to UCSC.&quot;</P><P><B>What do you like to do outside the lab?</B></P><P> &quot;I enjoy biking with friends.&quot; </P><DIV id="wrapperBio"><P><B><MYH3>Dominic &quot;Dom&quot; Schenone (Lab Scribe)</MYH3></B>Biomolecular Engineering and Electrical Engineering Undergraduate</P><P> Originally from Etna, California</P><P><B>Why are you at UCSC?</B></P><P> &quot;I am interested in both robotics and synthetic biology.
