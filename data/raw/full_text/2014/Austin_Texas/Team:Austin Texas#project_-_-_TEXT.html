Interlab Study
The 2014 UT Austin iGEM team focused on four projects.  This includes our interlab study, as well as our Human Practices/Outreach , which took place during South by Southwest (SXSW), an annual Austin event.  Our two other projects focused on developing an assay to test non-canonical amino acids (ncAA) incorporation in living cells, and then using one of these ncAA to control gene expression.
Current project status:
General things to do:
Stitch together RS sequences (see Dennis) and create link pages that have the sequences on display.  These links should go from our RS table in the ncAA kit page.
ASSESS T7 two stop codon sequences.  PLAN ONBY FINAL EXPERIMENT.
Create link page for the ncAA kit plasmids within out "parts" page.  We want to have our plasmid sequences accessible as well as an e-mail address people could e-mail to request the kit.  This page also needs to precisely describe the "parts".
Update/make better our official biobrick parts pages.  With proper documentation
Finish judging sheet issues.
Make sure all references follow the current standard in the ncAA kit - synthetase table (and the references are then fully explained at the bottom of the page.
Create an "attribution" page??  What is officially required?
Kit - Needs data, discussion, conclusions.
Photocage - Needs revisions, data, discussion.
Interlab study - Needs data and assessment.
Caffeinated Coli - Human Practices - Needs more content.
