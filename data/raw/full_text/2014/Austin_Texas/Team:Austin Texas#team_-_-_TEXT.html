About Us
The 2014 UT Austin iGEM team featured a mix of new and returning team members. While we had two returning undergraduates, Kate and Jordan, the rest of the team was new. Two of our new students, Ella and Nathan, had never even worked in a lab before. The team used our caffeinated coli project in March 2014 to get everyone acquainted with the basic techniques the team would use throughout the coming year. New team members also took or sat in on Prof. Barrick's CH391L Synthetic Biology course for an introduction to different types of genetic parts, synbio methods, and ethical issues.
All five undergraduates worked steadily during the summer on our two main projects and the interlab study, learning a number of techniques and generating some very nice data.  During the fall, the team has been wrapping up experiments and finishing up the data assessment, while also making our presentation and team wiki.

Team Members
Undergraduates
Alejandro "Alex" Gutierrez
I am a third-year undergraduate neurobiology major, and a new member of the iGEM team. Before joining iGEM, I did research in creating metal nanoparticles to use as catalysts. Besides doing research, I also enjoy cooking, reading, and sleeping.
Jordan Monk
I'm a senior cell & molecular biology major returning from last year's iGEM team. I plan to keep doing this molecular biology thing for a living because I haven't figured out yet how little money there is to be made. I'm probably in lab as you're reading this.
Catherine "Kate" Mortensen
A returning member from the 2013 iGEM team and biochemistry major. I believe synthetic biology is truly fascinating and has the potential to make positive impact on society. I'm extremely grateful for my team this year but especially for my advisors who have shown relentless patience, generosity, and guidance. I plan to continue my education in biochemistry and synthetic biology and hope to make a stamp in the world.
Nathan Shin
I'm a third year microbiology major at the greatest university in the entire world. Besides my immense love for all things iGEM, I also enjoy sleeping, playing tennis, and binge watching Netflix. And I also enjoy long walks on the beach.
Ella Watkins
I am third year at the University of Texas, and striving to earn my Bachelors of Science in Biology. This summer has been such a whirlwind of amazing learning and hands on experience. I am so grateful to have been given the opportunity to participate on the iGEM team. I remember my first successful PCR as if it was only 5 months ago… oh wait, it was.
A perfect view from our office this year. The eyes of Texas were upon us! Hook em!!

Advisors
Dennis Mishler, Ph.D.
Postdoc in the Barrick lab .  First year mentoring the iGEM team.  Dennis has worked on projects relating to synthetic biology and RNA sequence/structure relationships for an undisclosed number of years.  He has also worked with undergraduates in the classroom or at the bench for the past several years.
Michael Hammerling
Ph.D. Student in the Barrick lab , and two-time previous iGEM advisor . Mike contributed his expertise with non-canonical amino acid incorporation systems and helped field day-to-day questions from the iGEM team.
Professor Jeffrey Barrick
Third year advising the UT Austin iGEM team. The Barrick lab works at the interface of microbial synthetic and evolutionary biology. Look us up if you are an iGEM alum interested in Ph.D. programs at UT Austin!
T-shirt and Theme
The graphics theme for our t-shirt and website design was adapted from the Cards Against Humanity game.
Attributions
Unless otherwise noted, all projects, lab work, and materials were created by the five undergraduate team members listed above with assistance and oversight from the three team advisors.
Special thanks to:
Razan Alnahhas ( 2012 and 2013 UT Austin iGEM team member , graduated class of 2014, now in Ph.D. program at Rice University)
Trained new team members who had never previously worked with bacteria and helped with the SXSW Create event .
Ashley Kessel (UT Austin Undergrad, Physics)
Helped with the SXSW Create event and team fundraising.
Sean Leonard (Ph.D. Rotation Student, Barrick Lab)
Showed the team how to run an SDS protein gel and gave advice on how to handle the ncAA 4-azidophenylalanine (AzF).
Dr. Colin Brown (Postdoc, Barrick Lab)
Assisted with designing the measurement kit fusion protein and discussed issues related to future mass spec experiments.
Andre Maranhao (Ph.D. Student, Ellington Lab)
Helped with an early version of the card graphic design.
Karen Ingram
Invited the team to participate in SXSW Create. Check out her very cool projects remixing art, design, and synthetic biology on her website and twitter .
The team would also like to thank other members of the Barrick and Ellington labs for helpful comments, advice, and suggestions throughout the summer!
Funding
We would like to thank the NSF BEACON Center and the UT Austin Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology , Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology , and Department of Molecular Biosciences for funding that made it possible for us to work on these research projects and attend the Giant Jamboree!
We would also like to thank New England BioLabs for cloning materials provided and Integrated DNA Technologies for discounts on oligo and gBlock synthesis.
