urban algae sources
We used natural algae to simulate the use of genetically altered algae. We sourced the algae from the following sites in Los Angeles:
1. LA River Algae: We went to the kayak launch point along the river. This section of the LA River gives the public access to the water's edge. This is also a deeper "cleaner looking" section of the river where we found plenty of algae. This hyrbid urban/wild sample seemed to grow the fastest. This might not be true. We might have just convinced ourselves that it did because we think the LA River is full of toxic waste... This algae strand must be a mutant.
2. Chinatown Algae: Usually a wishing well, this famous urban pond exists right in the middle of Chinatown. It contains lots of coins from wishes and has algae lining the tiled sides. We collected our sample off the sides of the wall. This algae grew the slowest but was also the least amount of algae collected.
3. Huntington Gardens Coy Pond Algae: Right in the middle of The Huntington Botanical Gardens, this healthy pond has lots of coy fish and lily pads. We took the sample from the waters edge, avoiding the hungry coy fish. This sample was very vibrant and green.
4. CalTech Turtle Pond: Located in the middle to the CalTech campus, this collegiate pond is home to a small population of turtles. We collected a sample from the waters edge. The algae grew well and was on the lighter green side in comparison to the other samples taken.
