Model: The home pool To model our algae fuel pool concept we created a series of pools at different scales. Each scale enabled us to test and explore a different set of interaction.
Home Pools is based on home pools and uses a baby pool to simulate an LA resident cultivating an algae fuel pool in their backyard. How does the person learn to take care of the algae? What new habits form? What do the neighbors think? What changes occur at the site? This simulation focused on the human interaction.
Neighborhood Pools model is based two neighborhood blocks, one in Beverly Hills and the other in Long Beach as seen through Google Satellite view. The micro neighborhood is a set of six scaled down pools and houses used to simulate a neighborhood of algae fuel pools. Can algae spread? If one person started their own algae fuel pool would it spread to the neighbors? How does it spread? Would this encourage neighborhoods to grow the same algae? This simulation focused on environmental interactions.
