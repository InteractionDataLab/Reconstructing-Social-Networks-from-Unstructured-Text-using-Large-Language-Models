Dave Wernick 1. Jasmin Blasco is a French/American artist living in Los Angeles CA.
He defines his practice as an instrumental method in which research and collaboration play a central role. Specifically his inquiry focuses on the tensions between the speculative model and the materials it encounters. This investigation proceeds through the design of fictionalized instruments for various contexts. With The NOISE INDEX, he explores the topicality of informational hunger within a framework that is critical of expected display strategies.
The works Convergence and Horizon have been exhibited in Paris and New York at Cutlog, through Fragmental Museum. He also hosts "Speak My Language" a monthly show on Dublab.
