Background
Effects of Long-Term Cadmium Exposure
In 2012, a major cadmium spill occurred in the Guangxi Longjiang River. It was estimated that nearly 40,000 kilograms of fish were found dead between January 15th and February 2nd as result of the spill, clearly demonstrating the level of toxicity of the compound. Even in low concentrations, the impact of cadmium exposure can be dire.
Current Methods for Cadmium Pollution Treatment 1. Chemical Precipitation
The most common method used currently to treat cadmium pollution is hydroxide precipitation. Hydroxide precipitation involves raising the pH of the water using alkaline agents. This causes dissolved metals in the water including Cadmium to precipitate in the water as hydroxides. Generally, the metal-hydroxide sludge is then filtered from the water using a clarifier. Chemical precipitation offers a permanent, easily implemented solution. However, in cases of low-cadmium exposure
