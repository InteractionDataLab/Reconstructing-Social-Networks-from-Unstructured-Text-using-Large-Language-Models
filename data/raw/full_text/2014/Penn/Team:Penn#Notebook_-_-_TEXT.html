Week 1
Molecolar Biology Training Workshop
Practiced the basics of molecular cloning
Week 2
Idea Brainstorming and Generation
Compiled a preliminary list of potential ideas
Week 3
Settled on two main ideas: 1. Quorum sensing with antibiotics 2. Heavy metal removal with Magnetotactic bacteria
Learned how to use Geneious to design cloning process
Practiced extracting biobricks and transforming NEB Turbo cells with plasmids
Human Practices
Visited Biomeme to get the portable qPCR machine
Week 4
Decided on the project idea: Heavy metal removal with Magnetotactic bacteria
Identified primers and promoters in AMB-1 strain
Identified AMB-1 transformation vector
Extracted smtA biobrick gene and made glycerol stock
Week 5
Developed three goals to accomplish for the project
Determined the constructs to clone into AMB-1
Designed two fast-fail experiments
Created a workflow for the construction of plasmid
Human Practices
Planned outreach events at high school summer programs
Week 6
Ordered chemicals for AMB-1 growth medium
Completed primer design
Obtained AMB-1 strain from Dr.Goolian
Week 7
Determined the OD600 plate reading conversion formola experimentally
Attempted to do E.Coli and AMB-1 cadmium tolerance test
Designed all construct on Geneious
Human Practices
Met with Dr.Rizk to discuss presenting to incoming bioengineering freshmen
Week 8
Ordered DNAs from Genscript and IDT
Week 9
Redid E.Coli Cadmium Tolerance Test in M9 media
Learned to do cell count for AMB-1
Attempted to make AMB-1 chemically competent
Human Practices
Presented to high school students at Penn M&T program
Planned a synthetic biology preceptorial
Contacted Schuylkill Action Network
Week 10
Completed AMB-1 growth curve under different media
Determined cell count and OD600 conversion formola for AMB-1 experimentally
Completed E.Coli Cadmium Tolerance Test in LB media
Human Practices
Volunteered at SEA Science Carnival
Week 11
Addressed EMSGM growth problem with pH
Make new recovery media with adjusted pH for optimal AMB-1 growth
Chemical Transformation with different recovery broths
Attempted PCR assembly with synthesized parts
Week 12
Used anaerobic chambers to grow plates
Troubleshooted lack of magnetism with new iron maleate solution
Troubleshooted AMB-1 electroporation experiment with plating at every step
Began cloning successfolly assembled PCRed constructs into PYMB essentials
Week 13
Finished cloning flurescent protein with smtA and mCherry into PYMB essentials
Transform AMB-1 with this construct to test for successfol transformation with fluorescence test
Week 14
Make new E-MSGM media
Re-designed construct
Week 15
Troubleshooted cloning E. coli construct for cadmium tolerance
Sequence verified finished constructs on PYMB
Week 16
Built the prototype of a portable spectrophotometer for cell recovery experiment
Designed primers for Gibson Assembly of final construct
Human Practices
Presented to Penn BE 100 lecture to intriduce synthetic biology to freshman bioengineers.
Week 17
Tested AMB-1 aerobic colture and anaerobic colture with magnetometer
Troubleshooted and retried cloning E. coli construct
PCRed up parts we received for construction of shuttle vector
Week 18
Tested AMB-1 aerobic colture and anaerobic colture with magnetometer
Finished PCRing parts we received from IDT
Week 19
Measured the magnetic strength indicator T2 for various concentration of AMB-1 colture and attempted to develop a trendline
Counted folly grown sample of aerobic AMB-1 and made a trendline converting OD to cell concentration
Cloned all biobricks into PSB1C3 backbone
Week 20
compiled all data and graphics for wiki
