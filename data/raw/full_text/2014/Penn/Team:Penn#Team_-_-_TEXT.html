University of Pennsylvania iGEM
The Penn iGEM 2014 team is comprised of five undergraduates, with backgrounds ranging from biochemistry to chemical engineering to bioengineering.
The Team Members
Jane Shmushkis
Bioengineering, 2017
"I'm redesigning the redesign of version 3 of the updated one!"
Amey Vrudhula
Bioengineering, 2017
"I have one more question"
Nikita Rao
Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, 2016
"Yeah, I get free tea every morning, and I got a free burger yesterday. Speaking of free stuff, I got free Chipotle the other day."
Renyao Wei
Bioengineering and Computer Science, 2015
"Yeah. Sure. Whatever"
The Advisors
Brian Chow, Ph.D
Assitant Professor
Chow's laboratory aims to create technological innovations to enhance therapeutic interventions in CNS disorders, and to this end, focuses on engineering tools to elucidate, diagnose and treat the diseased brain.
Spencer Glantz
Bioengineering (PhD student)
Spencer helped found the first iGEM team at the University of Pennsylvania and has been lending us his deep knowledge and experience with synthetic biology ever since. He helped us every day and truly made this project possible.
Michael Magaraci
Bioengineering (PhD student)
We always found Mike at Chow's Lab late at night. He offered us his knowledge of synthetic biology and really helped us troubleshooted many issues; "color:#FFF"
Danielle Fields
iGEM guru
Danielle makes sick graphics on Illustrator.
Danny Cabrera
iGEM guru
Danny helped us a lot on graphic design and offered incredible advice.
Josh Tycko
iGEM guru
Insanely resourceful; Josh always hook us up with the right people for the right task.
Nothing would be possible without him
Sevile Mannickarottu
Director of Bioengineering Instructional Laboratories
We would also like to thank the following people for their help
Dr. Mark Goulian for his generous donation of AMB-1 and protocols
Dr. Karen Hogan for her knowledge of microbiology and microscopes
Dr. David Issadore for sharing his knowledge on magnetic particles and access to NMR in his lab
Lauren Marquez for shooting the introduction film for us
Alex Daley-Montgomery for assiting on designing the wiki
Professor Sid Deliwala for arranging a presentation for Penn M&T summer program
David Gdula from NEB for providing us with various reagents
Miranda Wang for her work in AMB-1 transformation.
