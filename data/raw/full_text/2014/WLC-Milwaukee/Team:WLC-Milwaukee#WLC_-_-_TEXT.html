Wisconsin Lutheran College (WLC) is a liberal arts college just outside of Milwaukee, Wisconsin comprised of just over 1000 undergraduate students. However, just because we are a smaller school does not mean we are not doing incredible things. The school is committed to creating Christian leaders while giving students a rigorous, yet rewarding, education. Many different scientific disciplines are studied at WLC and include pre-professional programs, biochemistry, chemistry, and varying disciplines within the field of biology. Our smaller size also allows students to work one-on-one with professors in research within a variety of academic disciplines. Furthermore, our close proximity to the Medical College of Wisconsin, one of only two medical schools in the state, allows for research opportunites and collaboration that extend past the undergraduate level.
