Synthetic Biology Summer Camp Report 2014
This year’s summer camp was a success. High school students were invited to come to WLC for one week to learn about Synthetic Biology. We invited experts to speak about their respective biological fields to our students. Students were introduced to the laboratory, and learned basic techniques that are used in research laboratories worldwide. We also introduced a new group work session this year to develop the student’s professional presentation and collaboration skills.
Curriculum
Monday
On Monday we met our students! We distributed materials including the 2014 Synthetic Biology Summer Camp Lab Manual. Mr. Nickels started our summer camp with a talk about religion and science. He described the differences between them, and how we are able to be a strong Christian as well as a strong scientist. Next, Dr. Werner introduced our students to the field of Microbiology.  Students learned how larger organisms like us are different from bacteria. After lunch, we dove into the lab. We discussed laboratory safety with our students, and taught them how to use a micropipette, the biologist’s main tool. After students were comfortable with a pipette, it was time to turn bacteria green! This was accomplished by performing a transformation; inserting new DNA into bacterial samples. We selected projects for group work, and introduced what iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines competition) is.
Tuesday
On Tuesday, Dr. Erbe spoke to our students about bacterial genetics and why they are easier to manipulate genetically than larger organisms. Dr. Barbieri then shared his knowledge of proteins and their structure and function. We began to grasp the pathway from DNA to proteins. In lab, we grew bacteria for experiments, isolated DNA from bacteria and determined the concentration of that DNA. During group work, teams learned more about the project that they selected and discussed what a professional presentation entails.
Wednesday
On Wednesday Dr. Werner returned to demonstrate the Central Dogma of Biology using all candy! With marshmallow base pairs and licorice DNA backbones, the students reinforced their understanding of the Central Dogma. After a quick lunch, we were off to the Milwaukee School of Engineering. Here, Dr. Herman showed us around his protein-modeling laboratory. He used physical models to explain the basic chemical interactions that occur in biology. We were also able to see a 3D printer in action! Then it was back to WLC to work on our group projects.
Thursday
On Thursday we began by discussing with Dr. Henkel the horror that microbiology can bring. Next, Dr. Geurts shared the great benefit that genetic engineering can bring. He discussed how in his laboratory at the Medical College of Wisconsin they were able to knock out genes in rats. He shared the different methods that we are able to genetically engineer higher-ordered organisms than bacteria. In lab, we made millions of copies of a strand of DNA through the use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction. We then cleaved DNA in a specified location to cut out a sequence of interest. We made the final preparations for our presentations with our groups.
Friday
We began this morning with presentations from our students! Camp staff made a comment sheet for each student, specifying areas for improvement as well as areas in which each student exceled. Students then received individualized packets with comments so they could improve on their presentation skill set. We then had walking tacos to go on a tour of WLC. It was great to stretch our legs after hearing awesome presentations from our peers! Then it was back to lab. We ran DNA through a gel to determine size of DNA from the previous day. We learned about the implications that this procedure has in crime scenes and DNA identification. Next, students were able to dissect a fetal pig. Students that were not as enthused about fetal pig dissection went down to a pond by Froedtert hospital to collect water samples. We looked at all the microorganisms in the water under a microscope! During the afternoon we headed outside for a cook out! We had a pick up game of soccer. We cooled down inside with popsicles and watching Battlefield Cell. It was then time to say goodbye, we hope to see our students again at camp next year or around the WLC campus!
Improvements from 2013
We had a successful camp in 2013, but we were able to make several improvements to our program this year. The enrollment increased by 100%, and the student attendance increased by 71%. We were able to add 2 hours of group work to each day so the students could prepare a presentation. This was very well received by the students, and proved valuable to them to develop professionally. Our lab curriculum was vastly improved; all of our experiments were successful. The students gained a better understanding of the purpose of each lab because there was better continuity between experiments. A special thank you to Mr. Nickels, Dr. Werner, Dr. Henkel, Dr. Barbieri, Dr. Herman, Dr. Erbe, and Dr. Geurts for spending time with our students!
Student Responses
"Going to this camp allowed me to gain more knowledge about biochemistry and how genetic engineering can be used to improve our lives. In the fall, I will be starting college and I found this event to be an excellent educational experience. The opportunity I was given to listen to many lectures from professors has given me a good understanding about the world of science. I enjoyed the labs we worked on which gave me the chance to become familiar with lab equipment and learn how to work safely in a lab. This summer camp also provided me the chance to discover my strengths and use critical thinking to solve problems." - Andrew R.
"I really enjoyed all of the different speakers. It was great to have presentations and in depth lectures to help teach what we were learning for that day. It was really useful.  Also, being in lab and getting to do all those different labs that I have never done was really cool as well. I learned a lot (seeing how the binder we got was filled with a lot of great information as if I was in a regular class at school). I enjoyed being informed on information I did know already and didn’t. The camp was very well put together." - Jena P.
"My favorite part of the camp was the lab work and presenting in front of the group.  It showed others what I had learned. I also thought it was cool that some campers could stay overnight.  It was awesome!  Great help!" - Amelia L.
"It was SO FUN!  I was kind of unsure about what we'd be doing, but I was very happy with everything.  Overall this camp is full of happy memories and I am so glad I came!" - Brianna W.
