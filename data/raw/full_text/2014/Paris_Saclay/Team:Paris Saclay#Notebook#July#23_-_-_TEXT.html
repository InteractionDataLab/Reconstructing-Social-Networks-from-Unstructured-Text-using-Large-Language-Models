Lab work
The Suppressing Salicylate System
Rehydration of BioBricks
by Fabio
The first step of this Subproject is to rehydrate the following BioBricks. Both provided in the iGEM 2014 DNA Kit Distribution.
BBa_J61051 - Salicylate promoter + NahR
BBa_K228001 - RNA suppressor
Lemon scent
p cola part 2
by Sean
p cola DNA was extracted in several instances yesterday. Today we attempt to collect all of the DNA and precipitate it.
Protocol
Add equal parts plasmid DNA and ethanol 100% in a 1.5 microcentrifuge tube.
If total volume is V, then add V/5 of sodium acetate (initial concentration of NaAc is 3M; we want a final concentration of .3M). Numerical application: Total volume of p cola was 150μl. Hence 150 μl of ethanol 100% was added, as well as 30μl of NaAc 3M. Incubate at -20°C for 30 minutes. (5:20pm - 5:50pm in our case)
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4°C and at 11000g.
Discard supernatant.
Add 1ml of ethanol 70%.
Repeat step 3.
Discard supernatant. Make tube interior as dry as possible. Tip: use a paper towel on which to lightly tap the rim of the tube. Dry pellet in oven at 37°C. Note: we decided to leave the tube at room temperature and continue tomorrow instead.
(tomorrow) Resuspend pellet in 30μl H2O milliQ.
Modeling
Meeting of modeling with advisor Claire to talk about:
Diffusion of O2 in the gel
Bacterial growth on the surface
translecture system
Diffusion of the limonene
Reunion
