The team created two BioBricks in the framework of the projet within the part Lemon Ripening . We had to design a control system to move from a "green state" to a "yellow state" by switching from a “+ ARNt suppressor" state to a “– ARNt suppressor” state. Thus, we put the production of suppressor tRNA (SupD-tRNA) under the control of a substrate that will be consumed by bacteria of the growth-medium over time: the salicylate.
Both BioBricks shown below were constructed by the blending of three BioBricks in two steps to get the control system of the production of SupD-tRNA by salicylate.
The first step: construction of BBa_K1372000, by assembling of BBa_J61051 and BBa_K228001 .
The second step: construction of BBa_K1372001, by assembling our BBa_K1372000 and BBa_B0015 .
