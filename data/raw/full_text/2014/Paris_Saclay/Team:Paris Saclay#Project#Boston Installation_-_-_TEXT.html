Boston Installation
The idea is to produce a sculpture, a branch,  which would be in front of a mirror. On the spectator side,  the branch seems « normal » but its reflection in the mirror shows  something else : the reflection would reveal the inner branch, as a dissection. And we could see mechanisms as in a machine. The aim of this structure is to show the gap between a object and its reflection, between real things and decoys.
