Construction of the fusion protein (color)
Plasmid DNA Extraction and Electrophoresis
by Terry
Biobricks used:
BBa_K1033927 with pSB1C3 (pink chromoprotein)
BBa_K1033910 with pSB1C3 (yellow chromoprotein)
BBa_K1033921 with pSB1C3 (red chromoprotein)
BBa_K1033922 with pSB1C3 (red chromoprotein)
BBa_K1033902 with pSB1C3 (blue chromoprotein)
BBa_K731201 with pSB1C3 (Arabinose inductible araC-pBAD promoter)
BBa_K1033925 with pSB1C3 (pink chromoprotein)
BBa_K1033905 with pSB1C3 (purple chromoprotein)
BBa_K1033913 with pSB1C3 (orange chromoprotein)
BBa_K1033929 with pSB1C3 (blue chromoprotein)
Result:
Success, all DNAs have the expected size
Protocol
Salicylate Inducible Suppressing System
Plasmid DNA Extraction & Electrophoresis
by Terry
Biobricks used:
12 BBa_J45017 with pSB1C3
13 BBa_J45017 with pSB1AK3 (pchBA synthase (converts chorismate to salicylate))
(12 and 13 = on the previous gel)
Protocol
Transformation of competent E.coli cells
by Fabio
We transformed in DH5α both BioBricks rehydrated yesterday (BBa_J61051 and BBa_K228001).
Samples:
BBa_J61051 Concentrated
BBa_J61051 Undiluted
BBa_K228001 Concentrated
BBa_K228001 Undiluted
DH5α Control
Results on 25th July morning:
Success, grown very well (> 200 colonies)
Success, grown well (> 50 colonies)
Success, grown well (> 90 colonies)
Success, grown (15 colonies)
Success, nothing has grown

Biobricks used:
7. BBa_K762100 with pSB1C3 (Limonen synthase1 with RBS)
Protocol
Gel electrophoresis of p cola
by Sean
p cola used: sample left overnight yesterday resuspended in 30μl of H2O milliQ.
Protocol
Results of the PCR Targeting
by Romain
PCR targeting made the July 22nd. Strains used: DY330 (clone I and II). Plasmid used: pJBEI-6409 (code for enzymes to produce limonene from glucose in E. coli)
Results:
Nothing has grown on the control dishes.
Failure, nothing has grown on the clone I dishes.
Failure, other bacteria have grown on the clone II dishes.
We have to make another PCR. Liquid culture of DY330 made in 30ml LB.
New PCR of the oligonucleotides iPS70 and iPS71 made with the enzyme DreamTaq.
Protocol:
108,75µl of H2O MilliQ
15µl DreamTaq buffer
6µl oligonucleotide iPS70
6µl oligonucleotide iPS71
4,5µl DMSO
6µl Plasmid Posv230 diluted
3µl dNTP
0,75µl of DreamTaq enzyme
Results: After the PCR, the electrophoresis has revealed nothing.
So we made another PCR of the oligonucleotides iPS70 and iPS71 with the GoTaq enzyme.
56,5µl of H2O
20µl of GoTaq Flexi Green buffer (5X)
4µl oligonucleotide iPS70
4µl oligonucleotide iPS71
3µl DMSO
2µl Plasmid Posv 230 no dilute
2µl dNTP
8µl MgCl2
0,5µl GoTaq Green enzyme
PCR program: 95°C during 30seconds, then [95°C during 30sec + 60°C during 30sec + 72°C during 2min] (30 cycles) then 72°C during 5min, and then 12°C to infinity.
Results tomorrow
