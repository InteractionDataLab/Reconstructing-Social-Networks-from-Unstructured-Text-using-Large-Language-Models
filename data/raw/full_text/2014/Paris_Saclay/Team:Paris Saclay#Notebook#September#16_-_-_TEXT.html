Lab Work
By Mélanie
Lemon scent
Plasmids extraction
Extraction of the plasmid from the culture made yesterday (PS)
Digestion of PS topo plasmids
by PacI and PSTI
(well 2 and 3 : PacI digestion)
Ligation
After digestion, ligation overnight in PPS1
PCR Colony
Test of the transformation made yesterday to know if we had obtained a plasmid]
primer to ckeck the direction of the insert PPS2 :  iPS72-96
PPS4 : ips72-97
= no insert (just well 1-9)
liquide culture
liquide culture from yesterday's colony to make stock tomorrow
PCR cad to cloning in pSBIC3
PCR and digestion PSTI/ecoRI and ligation
PCR GS
PCR to check if we have the insert in our topo plasmid
see here
Construction of the fusion protein (color)
PCR
PCR to check if we have the insert in our topo plasmid
see here
well 2-9 = chromo yellow in topo plasmid well 10-17 = chromo blue in topo plasmid
Photo of the Day
Work of Thérèse Bichon , one of those few we have interviewed during this month of september.
