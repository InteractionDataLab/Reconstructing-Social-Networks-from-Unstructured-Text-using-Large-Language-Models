PCR with bacteria
From the petri dish ( made here , I select some clone to do a PCR : clones 1-2-3  for cad clones 4-5 for PS clones 6 for LS

We identify that we have success with to clone of PS. (well 5-6)
Liquide culture of clones
The PS clone that reveal to be ok are cultivate in LB + AMP médium
Checking PCR
Electrophoresis of the PCR made Friday
LS PS GS CAD (and chromo) (2 enzymes = vent taq and dream taq)
Cloning
With this PCR, I do a cloning in a Topo Cloning vector (Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit) (LS GS and CAD)

Between 5 and 30 min at room temperature
Transformation
Add 50µL of bacteria to the clonage previously done
30min on ice 45 sec at 42°C
add 1ml of LB
1hour at 37°
Spread on a petri dish
Construction of the fusion protein
We check the sequence of the fusion protein and identify a clone with our chromoprotein = W6
