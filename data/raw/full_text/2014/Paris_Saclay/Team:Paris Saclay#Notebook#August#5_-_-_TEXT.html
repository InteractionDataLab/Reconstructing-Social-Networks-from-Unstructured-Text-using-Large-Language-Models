The chassis coli Odor free
PCR verification
by Romain
Results of the striates on dishes from yesterday :
For the strain MG1655Z1:
Nothing has grown on the kan dish, but the colony grew on LB dish. That was what we expected, the kan cassette was correctly delete.
For the strain MG1655:
Few colonies have grown on the kan dish, and all the colonies have grown on LB dish. It's a little failure.
So now, we proceed to the PCR to verify the length of the sequences.
Strains used: E. coli MG1655Z1 and E. coli MG1655, and oligonucleotides used: iPS75 bis and iPS76 bis.
Protocol
Add into a PCR tube the following:
Component
For a total volume of 50μl
H2O
28.25μl
Green GoTaq buffer 5X
10μl
dNTPs 10mM
1μl
iPS75 bis 10µM
2μl
iPS76 bis 10µM
2μl
DMSO
1.5μl
MgCl2 25mM
4μl
Bacterial culture
2μl
Green GoTaq enzyme
0.25μl
We follow these quantities for 11 tubes: 5 tubes for the strain MG1655, 5 tubes for the strain MG1655Z1 and 1 tube with bacteria which had grown on the kan dish. Tube was placed in PCR machine with the following parameters.

The different bacterial cultures in each tubes:
Tube 1 to 5: MG1655
Tube 6 to 10: MG1655Z1
Tube 11: MG1655 which had grown on the kan dish.
The electrophoresis results:
1. 10 µl of ladder
2 to 6. 10 µl in each tube of PCR for the strain MG1655
7 to 11. 10 µl in each tube of PCR for the strain MG1655Z1
12. 10µl of PCR for the MG1655 which had grown on the kan dish
Results of the PCR: The electrophoresis revealed correctly the expected size of the sequence, except for the holes 2 and 11. The kan resistance sequence had been successfully removed.
Liquid cultures overnight made: 3ml LB medium + 500µl transformed strain MG1655 + Cm
Salicylate Inducible Suppressing System
Liquid Culture
by Fabio
2 liquid cultures of BBa_K1372000 with 20ml of LB and 20µl of amp (at 3pm - 150 rpm - 37 °C), from the stock made the 4th August .
Lemon scent
Electrophoresis
by Sean & Pierre The strains used were made the 4th August
5 µl of BBa_K762100 non diluted
5 µl of BBa_K762100 diluted 10-1
5 µl of BBa_K517003

Continue my bibliographical research on Citral A and B and Beta-Pinene. I have now a little more than twenty reviews about various uses and properties of citral
Art & Design
by Leila & Juliette
We tested some different concentration of agar in LAG, how we can hang it, how it looks and how easy it is to turn it out : 15 g/l, 20 g/l, 25 g/l, 30 g/l, 35 g/l.
Concentration
Strength
Color
15 g/l
to much liquid : we can't hang it
really translucent
20 g/l
good holding and resistance
quite translucent
25 g/l
good holding and resistance
quite translucent
30 g/l
good holding and resistance
not so much translucent
35 g/l
really resistant. Maybe a little bit too heavy.
opaque
Finally, we though our test were effective and we decided to select only 3 concentration for the future : 20 g/l, 25 g/l and 30 g/l.
