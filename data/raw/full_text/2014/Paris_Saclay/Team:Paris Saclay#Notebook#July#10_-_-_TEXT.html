Lab work
Plasmid DNA Extraction
by Romain and Sean
Plasmids used:
BBa_B0015, dble ter
FNR_RBS_amilCP-Ter DH5αZ1
Protocol
The chassis coli Odor free
Transformation of competent cells E.coli
by Fabio and Maher
Competent strains used:
DH5α
MG1655
MG1655Z1
DH5α+ (given by Solenne)
(The strains DH5α, MG1655 and MG1655Z1 were prepared by Mathias and Mathieu)
BioBricks used:
BBa_J23100 (Amp R)(Dilutions: Concentrated, 0 and 10-1)
BBa_J23106 (Amp R)(Dilutions: Concentrated, 0 and 10-1)
BBa_J23114 (Amp R)(Dilutions: Concentrated, 0 and 10-1)
+ pET28a (Kan R)(Dilutions: 0, 10-1 and 10-2) (pET28a is a plasmid used to verify that the 4 strains are competent).
Negative control groups:
pET28a: without plasmid, nothing grows.
BBa_J23100, BBa_J23106, BBa_J23114: without the BioBrick, nothing grows.
Results:
pET28a: Nothing grows with the strains DH5α, MG1655, MG1655Z1. But the strain DH5α+ grows well.
BBa_J23100, BBa_J23106, BBa_J23114: The strain DH5α+ grow well and the 3 others strains grow less. They have to be more concentrated.
Protocol
