Lab work
The frame coli Odor free
PCR on odor-free E. coli
by Sean
We want to be sure that the odor-free E. coli really is E. coli. We will use a postitive control.
We have the expected result on electrophoresis
Salicylate Inducible Suppressing System
Bacterial culture:
by Fabio
To insure a resonate quantity of DNA, we made two liquid cultures from each box of the last process , resulting in a total of 8 liquid cultures composed by 5ml of LB, 5µl of Amp, and respective colonies (4 with BBa_J61051 and 4 with BBa_K228001) (at 9am - 37°C - 150 rpm).
The cultures number 1 and 3 were collect from concentrated colonies' boxes and number 2 and 4, from undiluted colonies'  boxes. At the end of the process, tubes 1 and 3 resulted in BioBricks' clones 1 and tubes 2 and 4, BioBricks' clones 2.
Lemon scent
Results PCR targeting
by Romain
After the night, the electrophoresis revealed the oligonucleotides iPS70 and iPS71 prepared with the GoTaq enzyme.
We made a PCR Clean-up. Protocol
After that, we made another electrophoresis which revealed successfully the purification.
Preparation of electrocompetent cells
by Romain
Strain used: DY330.
Protocol:
Dilution of 300µl of bacterial culture DY330 in 30ml of LB at 30°C.
When the culture OD650 = 0,6:
put in ice during 10min.
centriguge at 4°C, 5min, 4000rpm.
Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 30ml glycerol 10% COLD.
centriguge at 4°C, 5min, 4000rpm.
Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 15ml glycerol 10% COLD.
centriguge at 4°C, 5min, 4000rpm.
Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 200µl glycerol 10% COLD.
Transformation of electrocompetent cells
by Romain
Strain used: DY330. Plasmid used: pJBEI-6409 (code for enzymes to produce limonene from glucose in E. coli)
Make 2 électroporations in cold electroporation cuvettes:
A control cuvette(without DNA): 50µl of DY330.
A second cuvette: 50µl of DY330 culture + 1µl of pJBEI-6409 plasmid.
Electroporation : 2500V, 132W, 40µF.
After that, add 1ml of cold LB in each cuvette and transfer in 2 tubes to incubate during 1 to 2h at 30°C.
Spread on 4 dishes LB + Cm:
100µl of control (without plasmid)
50µl of transformed DY330 with pJBEI-6409
100µl of transformed DY330 with pJBEI-6409
The rest of transformed DY330 with pJBEI-6409 (concentrate in approximately 150µl)
Incubate for the weekend at 30°C.
Reunion
