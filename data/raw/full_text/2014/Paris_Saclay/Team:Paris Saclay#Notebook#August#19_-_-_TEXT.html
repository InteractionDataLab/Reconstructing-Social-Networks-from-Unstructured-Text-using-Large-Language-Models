Lab work
Chromoprotein + Lemon scent
Electrophoresis with the PpsI plasmide (obtain on thursday) + the chromoprotein PCR: we obtain results as expected

Purification of PCR products of limonen synthase
by Laetitia
We used the PCR products of limonen synthase prepared previously : August 18th
The five samples were pooled in one and then purified using this protocol : protocol
Bacterial transformation
by Laetitia
We used DH5alpha competent bacteria (prepared the 14/08) and they were transformed using the ligation product prepared previously August 18th using this protocol : protocol
We transformed 100µL of competent bacteria and we added the totality of the ligation product (pGEMTeasy containing LS or PS or GS)
Preparation of petri dishes
by Terry
10 dishes with:
Antibiotic
Concentration
XGal
80μg/ml
IPTG
2*10-3
Ampicillin
10-3
4 dishes with:
Antibiotic
Concentration
Ampicillin

Bacterial culture
by Laetitia
After the bacterial transformation, we spread for each strain (LS or PS or GS):
