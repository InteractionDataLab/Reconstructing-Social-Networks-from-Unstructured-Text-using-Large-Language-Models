Preparation of electrocompetent DY330 and transformation via pJBEI6409
by Sean
A. Preparation of DY330 strain
Protocol
Dilute 1 mL of DY330 in 100mL of LB at 30°C.
When optical density is around .6, divide the 100mL into four 50mL centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge for four minutes at 4°C, 4000rpm. Discard supernatant.
Repeat, but this time with 25mL of 10% glycerol solution in each tube.
Repeat, but this time with 12.5mL.
Remove supernatant and resuspend pellet with any remaining supernatant. Collect all of the strain from the four tubes then store in ice.
B. Transformation by electroporation
Protocol
Fill three electroporation cuvettes as follows. a)50µL of DY330+2µL of pJBEI6409 plasmid. b)50µL of DY330+4µL of pJBEI6409. c)Control without DNA.
Electroporation at 2500V, 132W, 40µF.
Add 950 µL of cold LB in each cuvette.
Incubate at 30°C and under agitation for two hours.
Spread on nine petri dishes (LB+Cm): 50 µL from each cuvette, 100 µL from each cuvette, remainder from each cuvette. Incubate overnight at 30°C. NB: before spreading the remainder, centrifuge it, then remove 750 µL of supernatant.
