Lemon Scent
Summary
In the part of the project, we want to express the main components of the lemon scent (limonene, β-pinene and citral) in the odor-free E. coli we constructed. For this, we plan to engineer a plasmid constructed by the team of Taek Soon Lee, bearing a complete mevalonate pathway, a geranyldiphosphate synthase and a (S)-limonene synthase, to express (i) a β-pinene synthase (BBa_K517003), (ii) a geraniol synthase (GES) and a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) to produce β-pinene and citral respectively. We also would like to characterize the limonene synthase biobrick constructed by the Edinburgh team (BBa_K762100) and verify whether it is functional by replacing the intial (S)-limonene synthase by the biobrick.
We managed to construct two plasmids, the plamsid containing the β-pinene synthase gene and the plasmid containing the geraniol synthase gene. Due to lack of time, we could not obtain the other plasmids.
Introduction
The lemon scent is due to many volatile compounds, but the three main components are the (S)-limonene, β-pinene and citral molecules. All these molecules belong to the terpene family of metabolites.[1][6]
Limonene
There are two isomeric forms of the limonene molecules: Odor of these two isomers are  different: the (R)-Limonene has a orangey smell whereas the (S)-Limonene has a strongly lemon scent. [2]
Pinene
There are also two isomeric forms of pinene: α- and β-pinene. In the lemon oil, β-pinene represents between 10-17% of the total compounds [3]. In contrast, there is no trace of α-pinene.
Citral
This is the principal component of the lemon grass and lemon smell and it is present in many other plants such as orange, verbena... Here again there are two stereoisomeric forms, geranial and neral. The trans isomer, geranial or citral A, has a strong lemon scent. Whereas, the cis isomer named neral or citral B has sweaker lemon scent. These compounds are often used in the perfume industry to reproduce the smell of lemon.
All these compounds come from a common precursor, the geranylpyrophosphate (GPP). This precursor is converted in one or two steps in the molecules we are interested in obtaining.
The desoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) parthway is the common pathway used by prokaryote cells to produce GPP. E. coli synthesizes GPP using the DXP pathway but in low quantity [4]. However, another pathway called the mevalonate pathway (MEV) exists in eukaryote and some prokaryotes. Moreover, plants can use both pathways to produce GPP in higher quantity. To copy the plants' strategy, we chose to add the MEV pathway to our engineered E. coli in order to produce higher quantity of GPP and thereby obtain a stronger lemon smell. The figure below is a scheme of the MEV pathway:
To tackle the problem of the low GPP bioavailability in E. coli, the Taek Soon Lee’s research group designed and constructed a plasmid with a complete biosynthetic mevalonate pathway for the production of GPP [3]. Then they expressed the Abies grandis (S)-limonene synthase (LS) gene in the same plasmid, called pJBEI6409. With this construction, they were able to produce 400 mg/L of (S)-limonene.
We decided to use their construction for the production of (R)-limonene, β-pinene and citral in E. coli. We thank the team of Taek Soon Lee for the gift of the pJBEI6409 plasmid.
Principle of our Constructions
For our project, we need to replace the (S)-limonene synthase (LS) gene by the (R)-limonene synthase gene (BBa_K762100), the β-pinene synthase gene (BBa_K517003) and the geraniol synthase (GES)- cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) genes.
However, pJBEI6409 was constructed using a 3A assembly method, meaning that no restriction sites flanking the LS gene exist. We therefore decided to replace the (S)-LS gene by an apramycin resistance cassette surrounded by PacI and SalI restriction sites using double homologous recombination. Then, the resulting plasmid (pPS1) will be used to clone various genes (limonene synthase – β-pinene synthase – geraniol synthase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase).
Construction of pPS1
Replacement of the LS gene by an apramycin cassette
The first step of this sub-project is to replace the (S)-limonene synthase (LS) gene by an apramycin-resistant cassette. This cassette is flanked by PacI and SalI restriction sites to make easy the cloning of the different genes.
The (S)-LS starting gene is replaced by the apramycin cassette by PCR targeting.
PCR amplification of the apramycin cassette with oligonucleotides iPS70 and iPS71 that contain the restriction sites PacI and SalI. The extremities of these oligonucleotides are homologous with the sequence that constitutes the LS gene.
Transformation of the E. coli DY330 strain [5] (hyperrecombinant strain) by the pJBEI6409 plasmid.
Transformation of the E. coli DY330/pJBEI6409 with the PCR product after induction of the recombination genes.
Verification of the clones by BglII digestion.
We call this plasmid pPS1.
