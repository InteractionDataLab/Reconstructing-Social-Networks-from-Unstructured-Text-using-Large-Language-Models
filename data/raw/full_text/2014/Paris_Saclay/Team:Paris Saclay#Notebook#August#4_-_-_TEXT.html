Lab Work
The chassis coli Odor free
Striate on Dishes
by Juliette & Romain
We screened MG1655 and MG1655Z1 colonies on LB and LB + Kanamycin dishes for the loss of kanamycin resistance cassette, using the colonies obtained from the streak plates prepared on LB dishes and incubated at 42°C. 1st August
Salicylate Inducible Suppressing System
Plasmid DNA Purification
by Eugene and Fabio
Ligation of BBa_J61051 and BBa_K228001 made the 30th July
From Liquid Culture made the 1st August
Protocol
Digestion to check
by Eugene and Fabio
In order to validate the hole Assembly Process, we did a final digestion. The samples were digested with the enzymes EcoRI and PstI, that separates the BioBrick Assembly core from theirs vectors. The graphic result of this process is shown in the next step.
Protocol:
Add 5 μl of the plasmid to digest.
Add 2 μl of buffer (Fast Digest Buffer 10x).
Add 0,2 μl of enzyme EcoRI.
Add 0,2 μl of enzyme PstI.
Complete with 12,6μl of H2O.
Mix gently.
Incubate at 37°C for one hour.
Electrophoresis
by Fabio
The Electrophoresis was used to verify the success of the Digestion and the success of the plasmid DNA purification at the same time. Strain number 9 represents the digestion's control as it is the BBa_K228001, the BioBrick used as vector. If the clones have the same size of the control, it indicates that we had no ligation between both BioBricks (BBa_J61051 and BBa_K228001). Each sample has 20 μl and the Ladder has 5 μl.

Failed, the plasmid had others digestions points.
Good, we have a good control.
BioBrick Assembly - Segregate Process Protocol
Final Stock
by Fabio
As the BioBrick Assembly was a success, proved by the last Electrophoresis, we have registered a new BioBrick named BBa_K1372000 together with its final stock. We used the Clones 2, 3 and 5 from Liquid Colonies made the 1st August as the Electrophoresis shows a good concentration of them.

Gel electrophoresis of BBa_K762100
by Sean
Samples used were prepared on the 30th July .
Results
From left to right: 5 µl of BBa_K762100 + "old" Phusion enzyme, 5 µl of BBa_K762100 + "new" Phusion enzyme
Electroporation
by Terry
Strain used: DY330 containing plasmid pJBEI6409.  We had to switch the Limonen Synthase cassette with the Apramycin resistance.
15 ml of culture has been placed at 42°C for 17 min then cooled 10 min before centrifugation.
Make 2 électroporations in cold electroporation cuvettes:
A control cuvette: 50µl of DY330.
A second cuvette: 50µl of DY330 culture + 8µl of PCR purified product identified the 21st July
Electroporation : 2500V, 132W, 40µF.
After that, add 1ml of cold LB in each cuvette and transfer in tubes to incubate during 1 to 2h at 30°C.
Spread on 4 dishes LB + Apramicine :
100µl of control
50µl of transformed DY330 with 8µl of PCR purified product
100µl of transformed DY330 with 8µl of PCR purified product
The rest of transformed DY330 with 8µl of PCR purified product
Incubate for 2 days at 30°C.

Miscellaneous

Ethics
Well, I just got back from one month of vacation and when I came, everybody was already on lab works. So, I decided to work on ethics first. Synthetic Biology and BioArt are controversial because one is about engineering living organisms, and therefore raises economic, religious, political, moral problems; and the other is about engineering the living organisms too but it's mostly USING the living organisms to do art, to carry a message. This is how I see the essential points of our project ethical problems. But my point of view is not fixed. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe there is something that I have missed. That's why I started with a research on GMOs in general to better understand those issues.
The first trangenic pet were GloFish, "TK-1" 2003 in Taiwan
California is completely against such animals but the funny thing is that California is one of the best supporters of agricultural GMOs. So, there is the question: Why the plants and not the fish? Probably economic benefits and ethical positions are the reasons. Then, is there a hierachy of living organisms? Why?
GMOs under commercial cover raise new problems on environment and commercial rights.
Take a look at the arguments between Anti-GMO and Pro-GMO movements. The 90's context for example in Europe after food crises like the mad cow disease, contribute to the incomplete acceptance by the Europeans.
Bibliography
I worked on ethics till one of our advisors ask me: "Can you do a research on the chemical components of the lemon odor please? I need more publications on chemical characterization of limonene, citral A and B, and beta-Pinene"
