liquide culture of some PS clone (topo)
Transformation of LS GS CAS (topo) to do stock
PCR pSCBC3 cloning
PCR of GS : primer with ecoRI and PSTI restriction site
Construction of the fusion protein (color)
PCR
We have decided to separate the two protein So I do a PCR to have the yellow and the blue protein and i cloned them in a topo plasmid.
