LabWork
Construction of the fusion protein
We made a classic exttraction of plasmids from the liquid cultures.
Check by electrophoresis if it worked and send it for sequencing.
Lemon scent

PCR LS
Electrophoresis of the PCR made Yesterday
well 2-3 = PCR with Dream taq or Vent taq
(well 4-5 = checking of the pps5 Extraction)
The PCR have success so I use the PCR clean up kit to purify it
Electrophoresis after purification
Digestion
In order to clone LS in pPSI, i Digest it by PacI
component
volume
H2O
3μl
buffer
1μl
PacI
1μl
PCR purify
5μl
Ligation
We already have some pPSI digested and dephosphorelated
So I do a ligation:
component
volume
H2O
5μl
buffer
2μl
ligase
1μl
pPSI
2μl
LS PCR
10μl
2 hours at room temperature and over night at 4°
pPS5
Plasmid exctraction using the kit (picture is here )
digestion by SalI
component
volume
H2O
11μl
buffer
5μl
SalI
2μl
pPS5
30μl
Electrophoresis
We saw that we have something strang with our plasmid but we wil check it tomorrow with a good ladder (the ladder here was normally on the well 1)
pPS3 and pPS4
We digest the plasmid by HindIII to direct our insert
component
volume
H2O
6μl
buffer
1μl
HindIII
1μl
pPS3/4
2μl
well 1 = ladder well 2-3-4 = pPS3 Well 5-6-7 = pPS4
results are very strange
