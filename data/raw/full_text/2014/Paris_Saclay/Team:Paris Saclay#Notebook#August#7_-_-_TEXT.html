Lab work
Salicylate Inducible Suppressing System
DNA purification gel agarose
by Fabio
Once the segregate process made yesterday by electrophoresis, the DNA correspondent to the core of BBa_K1372000 was purified from the gel agarose.
Segregate Process Protocol
Ligation
by Fabio
The final step to have a BioBrick Assembly is the Ligation reaction.
TODO: illustration of the process
BioBrick BBa_K1372000 (Salicylate promoter + NahR + RNA suppressor) as Part A
BioBrick BBa_B0015 (Terminator) as Part B

PCR of pCola plasmid (Geranyol Synthase)
by Melanie
we use the same protocol as yesterday but we have done 8 tubes to apply a gradient in the thermocycleur during the third step:
57°
56.3°
55.1°
53.3°
51°
49.3°
47.9°
47°
PCR protocol: 98° --> 2min

Human Practices
Art & Design
by Terry
Our lemon will be made of agar gel. We first thought of buying silicone mold. But I'll try to make the mold only with agar, cheaper than silicone.
First attempt :  I put about 100ml of hot liquid high density agar ( 35mg/ml ) in a becher and then immerged a test piece to mold.  I let the whole thing cool down in a refrigerator for 2 hours. Then, I unmold the test piece by cutting accurately around the mold. The mold is placed back in the becher ( without the test piece ), pierced delicately to the cavity and filled up with regular liquid agar ( 20mg/ml ). Cooled down again in a refrigerator for 2 hours.
BEWARE : The regular agar ( 20mg/ml )is heated to make it liquid but you want to put it in the mold. Too hot, and you will melt the mold. Too cold, and your agar will turn back solid.
Second attempt :  Same protocol than the first attempt, but with higher density agar ( 50mg/ml ). I let the mold with the test piece in it at refrigerator for the night.
Result : Opening of the first mold, the second one is not cut yet.
From the left to the right :
agar mold (35mg/ml) cut in two parts
agar test piece extracted
original test piece.
agar mold (50mg/ml) still intact.
