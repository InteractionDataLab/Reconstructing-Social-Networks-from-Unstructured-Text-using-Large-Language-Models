pPSI dephosphorylation
After 2 hours, add 1.5µL of Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) and let it 1 hour.
Then, inactivation of AP at 65°C during 15 minutes.
We've made a electrophoresis to check the digestion.

Transformation in competent E.coli DH5α
After 3 hours, take out the ligation tubes and add 100 µl of competent DH5α in each tube.
Then proceed to the transformation protocol .
- 20 minutes at 4°C
- 2 minutes 30 seconds at 42°C
- 2 minutes at 4 °C
- Add 0.9 ml of LB into the tubes
Finally put it in a incubator at 37°C for 30 minutes
PCR of CAD
With or synthetic gene, we decided to do a PCR to have more matrice.
