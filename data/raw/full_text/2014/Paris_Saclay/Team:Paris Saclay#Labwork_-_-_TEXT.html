Planning
We started the labwork in June. The first step was the research project scope and bibliography to ensure the feasibility of our project and to plan all the work we had to do during this wonderful iGEM summer.  In early July we began the experiments, which was completed in the end of September. In order to be effective, we organized ourselves into four groups of summer interns. The groups were formed by all the members of the team, so even students from areas other than biology could cooperate for the project in the laboratory. To ensure the smooth development of the project by all students, the work had a life cycle :
Learning: A non biologist had to first learn the basics of biology to understand the lab work.
Practice: The novice starts to do their experiments with the help of another biology student or an adviser.
Development: The aforementioned student becomes autonomous and takes initiative.
Transmission of acquired knowledge: The student, initially oblivious to practices in the lab, can transmit this knowledge at the end of their internship to newcomers.
