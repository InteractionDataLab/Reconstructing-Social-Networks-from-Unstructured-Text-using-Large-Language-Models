Reunion
Ethics Meeting
Discussion about questions raised from our project. At the end of the meeting, we agreed to conduct surveys targeted to the general public and to people with a more scientific background.
Meeting with Department (Essonne)
by Arnaud & Pierre
Meeting with an employee department General Council (Youth services corps - Essonne) for financing.
Modeling
by Arnaud, Juliette and Pierre
After long discussions, we have found an agreement : Arnaud will focus on the 3D-structure of proteins and then try to model the turning of the lemon from green to yellow, Eugène will work on the odor diffusion and Pierre & Juliette will put their attention on the bacterial population growth in space and time.
Then, we just raided the university library.
