Lab Work

Lemon Scent
Verfication of the pPS3/4/5 plasmid
Due to the strange results obtained last day, I do a PCR of the insert with the differents plasmid : I use the same PCR condition than September 2 but with the right primer and plasmid
We can see that we don't have any insert in our plasmid
PCR verification
We find some other PCR of BBa K762100 and  GS and  BBa_K517003 so we check it by electrophoresis
And I purify the PCR
Well 1 = Ladder Well 2 = GS Well 3 = PS Well 4 = CAD
We can see that we don't have lost a lot of our PCR product
cloning
