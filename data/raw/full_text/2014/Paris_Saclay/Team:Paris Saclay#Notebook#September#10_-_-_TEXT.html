Lab Work
by Mélanie
Lemon Scent
Plasmid extraction
From the liquide culture made Yesterday I do a plasmid extraction.
these clones (LS GS CAD) had sent to sequencing problem with ps
digestion
I digest with PacI the plasmid that contain LS and GS
component
volume
H2O
5μl
buffer
3μl
PacI
1μl
Plasmid
20μl
Purification
Electrophoresis to isolate the insert and purification with a kit = I failed
culture
As we failed to obtain two right extraction for LS, I try another clone so I do a liquide culture of the clones A and B
Modeling
by Arnaud, Eugène, Juliette and Pierre
Meeting about modeling with advisor Claire to talk about the achievement of our model
Diffusion of O2 in the gel : maths is OK but biologist need more drawings.
Bacterial growth on the surface : because of the new aspect of our project, we have to change our point of view. Tomorrow, a real discussion with the biologists is needed to understand more precisely what they are doing in the lab.
Translecture system : maybe we have to give up this part of our work because of the new project.
Diffusion of the limonene : Eugène has focused on the concentration of limonene in the atmosphere.
