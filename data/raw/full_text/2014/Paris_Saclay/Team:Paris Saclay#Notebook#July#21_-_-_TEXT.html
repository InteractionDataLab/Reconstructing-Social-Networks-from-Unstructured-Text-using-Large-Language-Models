Monday 21st July
Lab Work
The chassis coli Odor free
Results: Transformation of CaCl2 supercompetent cells
by Romain
Strains transformed: MG1655, MG1655Z1. from Bacterial Cultures transformed the 18th July
Results: Nothing has grown.
Results: Transformation of DY330 via pJBEI6409
by Sean
Transformation performed on the 18th July
Number of colonies per dish (source of bacteria: electroporation cuvettes prepared on the 18th July )
Volume of plasmid used
50μl from cuvette
100μl
remainder (850µl)
2μl of plasmid

Conclusion: The increase in colony number is proportional to the increase in volume used. The control yielded nothing. The results are coherent.

The new strains received
Electrophoresis
by Fabio (process A) and Mathieu (process B and C)
We used 2µl of DNA of the following Biobricks in a 1% Agarose Gel. The PCRs came from Mathias' manipulation made the 18th July .
Process A
BBa_J23119 Cl1
BBa_J23119 Cl2
BBa_J23106 Cl1
BBa_J23100 Cl2
PCR 1
PCR 2
PCR 3
PCR 4
PCR 5
PCR 6
PCR 7
PCR 8
PCR 9
PCR 10
Process B
BBa_J23100 Cl1
BBa_J23100 Cl2
BBa_J23106 Cl1
BBa_J23106 Cl2
BBa_J23114 Cl1
BBa_J23114 Cl2
Process C
Pooling and purifying PCR 9 and 10 from process A.
PCR purified products. IPS70 / IPS71 of pOsV230 (Apramycin)
BT 340 (plasmid's flipase)
Results:
A: From 1 to 4: Success, DNAs have the expected size.
A: From 5 to 12: Failure, No PCR products.
A: Numbers 13 and 14: Success, PCR products have the expected size.
B: All 6 extractions were successful.
C: Number 1: successful concentration of pOsV230's PCR product.
C: Number 2 had no migration.
