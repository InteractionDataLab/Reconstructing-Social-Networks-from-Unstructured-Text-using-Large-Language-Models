Lab work
The chassis coli Odor free
1 - Preparation of supercompetent cells
By Mathias & Romain
Strains used: MG1655 (x2), MG1655Z1 (x2).
Protocol
2 - Bacterial Culture
by Fabio and Maher
2 liquid cultures with 5ml of LB and 5µl of amp (at 9am - 37°C - 150 rpm), both BBa_J23119 from the concentrated colony made the 16th July
3 - PCR and Electrophoresis
by Arnaud & Mathias
PCR targeting with oligos IPS70 and IPS71 of pOSV230 (Apramycine).
Molecular weight marker 1kb
Empty
IPS70 and IPS71 (1)
IPS70 and IPS71 (2)
Results:
Failure, no PCR products.

Modeling
Study of bacterial population growth in space and time
by Pierre & Juliette
We have finished to study a first model for our problem. It is a simple birth/death model and we do a mix of deterministic and stochastic model in order to be most precise as possible.
We have focused our study on this (excellent !) book : Modeling Biological Populations in Space and Time by Eric Renshaw, and especially on chapters 1, 2 and 3.
We now hope to succeed improving our model to be more realistic !
