Notebook
We constituted our team in November 2013 and we had meetings twice a month until April. Then we met every week. The Lab work started in the beginning of June.
Use our calendar to have a look on our notebook and our filter to go directly to Lab Work, Reunion, Human Practices or Modeling work.
