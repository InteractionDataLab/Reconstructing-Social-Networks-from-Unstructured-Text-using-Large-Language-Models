Electrophoresis of 5 digestions of pPS5 by HindIII to check if the insert of CAD is in the right position
by Hoang Vu
1-5: pPS5 (pJBEI+CAD) digested by HindIII
6: pPS1 (pJBEI+Apra), our witness
7-8: ladder
Electrophoresis of the same 5 PCR pooled
by Laetitia
Gel agarose 0,8% - 100V
The totality of the 5 PCR have been used. Then, we cut the lane corresponding of the Limonene synthase gene on a UV table.
Purification of the PCR product of Limonene synthase (BBa762100)
by Laetitia We used the kit PCR-Clean-UP to extract the DNA from the agarose gel. Elution volume : 15µl
