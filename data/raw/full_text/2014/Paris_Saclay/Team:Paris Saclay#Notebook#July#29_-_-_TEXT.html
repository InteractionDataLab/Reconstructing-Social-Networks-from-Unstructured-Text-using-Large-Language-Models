Salicylate Inducible Suppressing System
Digestion
by Fabio
After the experiments done yesterday , we are sure to manipulate the right plasmid from both BioBricks and also that we have a good concentration of them. Now it's time to start the Assembly procedure in order to concatenate both BioBricks.
BioBrick BBa_J61051 (Salicylate promoter + NahR) as Part A
BioBrick BBa_K228001 (RNA suppressor) as Part B
The enzymes used were:
EcoRI and SpeI for BBa_J61051
PstI and XbaI for BBa_K228001

BioBrick Assembly - Digest Reaction Protocol
Segregate Process by Electrophoresis
by Fabio
First we tested both products of the digestions in order to verify the success of the reaction (Process A), which remained for 25 minutes in 100V. Once the sizes of the digestion's products confirmed, we did the Process B (1 hour in 100V) in order to segregate a good amount of DNA to the next step.
Process A
BBa_J61051
BBa_K228001
Process B
BBa_J61051 strains from the bottom band of process A
Results:
A #1: Success, we can clearly see the vector and the core of the BioBrick after the digestion.
A #2: Success, the digested BioBrick was cut one time and has the expected size.
B: Success, we have a very good concentration of the BBa_J61051's core.

Transformation of electrocompetent cells
by Arnaud & Terry
Strain used: DY330. Plasmid used: pJBEI-6409 (code for enzymes to produce limonene from glucose in E. coli)
Make 2 électroporations in cold electroporation cuvettes:
A control cuvette(without DNA): 50µl of DY330.
A second cuvette: 50µl of DY330 culture + 1µl of pJBEI-6409 plasmid.
Electroporation : 2500V, 132W, 40µF.
After that, add 1ml of cold LB in each cuvette and transfer in 2 tubes to incubate during 1 to 2h at 30°C.
Spread on 4 dishes LB + Cm:
100µl of control (without plasmid)
50µl of transformed DY330 with pJBEI-6409
100µl of transformed DY330 with pJBEI-6409
The rest of transformed DY330 with pJBEI-6409 (concentrate in approximately 150µl)
Incubate for the weekend at 30°C.
