1.1.3 Segregate process
1.1.4 DNA extration from agarose gels
1.1.5 Ligation
BioBrick Assembly
This protocol is based on the original 3A Assembly from iGEM. We modified it to a assembly that places the core of one BioBrick - here called Part A - into another BioBrick - here called Part B.
TODO: Process illustration [Format I and Format II]
Procedure
Enzymes
Note: Manipulate the enzymes with a proper subzero temperature support.
Part B placed after Part A:
Part A:
Enzyme A: EcoRI
Enzyme B: SpeI
Part B with Format I
Enzyme A: EcoRI
Enzyme B: XbaI
Part B placed before Part A:
Part A:
Enzyme A: EcoR1
Enzyme B: XbaI
Part B with Format II
Enzyme A: EcoRI
Enzyme B: SpeI
Digest reaction
Take a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube (Eppendorf) and put:
x μl of H20 milliQ (complement)
y μl of buffer (Fast Digest Buffer 10x) (1x final concentration)
z μl of Part A DNA
1 μl of Enzyme A
1 μl of Enzyme B
Repeat step 1 with Part B
Mix gently both tubes
Incubate at 37°C for one hour
Store Part B at -20°C.
Segregate process
If the buffer used has no Loading Dye, put it with 1x final concentration.
Follow the Electrophoresis Protocol with the following parameters:
Make a gel 0.8% agarose
Use 2% of BET concentration
Use a box with a long height and a double case for the DNA.
Run the gel at 100V for one hour
Determine the weight of the (Eppendorf) tube prior to use.
Minimize UV exposure time to avoid damaging the DNA.
Put the DNA fragment with a minimal agarose gel into the tube.
Note: Minimize UV exposure time to avoid damaging the DNA.
DNA extration from agarose gels
Excise DNA fragment / solubilize gel slice
Determine the weight of the gel slice by the difference of the tube's weight.
For each 100 mg of agarose gel < 2% add 200 μl Buffer NTI.
Incubate sample for 5-10 min at 50°C.
Vortex the sample briefly every 2-3 min until the gel slice is completely dissolved.
Bind DNA
Place a NucleSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up Column into a Collection Tube and load up to 700 μl sample.
Centrifuge for 30 seconds at 11,000 x g. Discard flow-through.
Load remaining sample if necessary and repeat the centrifugation step.
Wash silica membrane
Add 700 μl Buffer NT3 to the column. Centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 x g. Discard flow-through.
Dry silica membrane
Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g to remove Buffer NT3 completely.
Elute DNA
Place the column into a new 1.5 ml micro centrifuge tube. Add 15-30 μl Buffer NE and incubate at room temperature (18-25 °C) for 1 min.
Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g.
