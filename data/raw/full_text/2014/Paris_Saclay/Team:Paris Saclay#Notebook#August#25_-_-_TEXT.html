Lab work
Construction of the fusion protein
plasmid extraction : pGEMTeasy + chromoprotein
by Laetitia
We used the bacteria containing pGEMTeasy + chromoprotein launched by Melanie sunday the 24th for the plasmid extraction, 6 independent cultures which come from 6 independent colonies.
We made a stock of bacteria for each sample (x6).
To extract the plasmid, we used the plasmid DNA purification kit (Macherey-Nagel).
Digestion of pGEMTeasy+chromoproteinby XbaI and PstI
by Laetitia
The goal is to check the presence of the insert inside the plasmid. We digest the 6 samples of purified plasmid.

Results : lost of the sample D5 in a hole in the agarose gel
The samples 3, 4 and 6 seems to contain the chromoprotein gene (two bands)
--> We will try another plasmid extraction because the electrophoresis profil doesn't show bands for every sample.
Bacterial culture of DH5a containing pGEMTeasy + chromprotein
by Laetitia
We launched 6 cultures in 5mL LB + Ampi (1/1000) - 37°C at night . The bacteria come from the stock made before the plasmid extraction

Limonene synthase digestion
Because we don't success to have pPS2 - we try to digest again Limonene synthase in pGMET esay

when I done the electrophoresis to check the digestion, I have a surprise : no digestion.
So we check the pGMETesay plasmid with normaly the inserts (for LS GS and PS)and we saw that there is no insert in the plasmid.
