Aalto-Helsinki about iGEM in general. This year is their first time participating in iGEM so we gave some advice and answered their questions regarding iGEM.
Colombia about low-budget biology experiments. Colombia has asked iGEM teams to come up with cheap and easy ways to conduct biology experiments - our team has stepped up to the challenge as well.
York about our project and our view on women in science. York has gathered opinions from different iGEM teams on the matter, to see the similarities and differences between different iGEM teams on the matter, as well as women's roles in the teams themselves.
Surveys
We have completed the following surveys from various teams.
Linköping Sweden on peanut allergies
Virginia on bioethics
ETH Zurich on complexity
Warwick on bioethics
Experimental materials exchanges
Plasmids
pJBEI6409 (coding for MEV pathway enzymes to produce limonene from glucose in E. coli) provided by Taek Soon Lee from the Joint BioEnergy Intitute (Emeryville, USA)
plasmid (coding for GES gene) provided by Marc Fischer, from the Grapevine Secondary Metabolism team of the 'grapevine health and wine quality' research unit (Colmar, France)
We provided with iGEM Evry-Genopole Evry Team strains and primers of iGEM Paris Saclay 2013.
We applied Bettencourt's sweat patches. Bettencourt is collecting sweat samples from many people in order to study a wide variety of body odors. The patches are placed under the armpits (on the inside of the sleeves) and worn for a day, then detached from the clothes.
Antoine and Elise conducted interviews with 25 11th-graders for Lyon and
Lyon provided us with a 3D-printed lemon mold. This will help us give the shape of our "lemon".
