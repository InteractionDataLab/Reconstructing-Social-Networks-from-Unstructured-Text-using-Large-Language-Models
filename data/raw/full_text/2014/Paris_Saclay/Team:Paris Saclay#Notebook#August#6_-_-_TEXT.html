Wednesday 6th August
Lab work
The chassis coli Odor free
Final stock of MG1655
by Romain
2 final stocks of the MG1655 made with 1ml of strain and 250µl glycerol 87%, in -80°C.
Salicylate Inducible Suppressing System
Plasmid DNA Purification
by Eugene and Fabio
BBa_K1372000 Cl.1
BBa_K1372000 Cl.2
From Liquid Culture made the 5th August
Protocol
Digestion
by Eugene and Fabio
In order to place the BBa_B0015 just after the BBa_K1372000, we will start the Assembly procedure again.
BioBrick BBa_K1372000 (Salicylate promoter + NahR + RNA suppressor) as Part A
BioBrick BBa_B0015 (Double terminator) as Part B
The enzymes used were:
EcoRI and SpeI for BBa_K1372000
EcoRI and XbaI for BBa_B0015
TODO: Illustration of the process
BioBrick Assembly - Digest Reaction Protocol
Segregate Process by Electrophoresis
by Eugene and Fabio
BBa_B0015 digested by EcoRI and XbaI
BBa_K1372000 digested by EcoRI and SpeI

Lemon scent
PCR Clean-up
by Pierre & Sean
BioBricks used: BBa_K762100 and BBa_K517003 (PCR perfomed on the 4th August )
Protocol
PCR digestion
by Pierre & Sean
Protocol
For each BioBrick (Bba_K517003 and BBa_K762100)mix the following into a microcentrifuge tube.
component
volume
H2O
5.5μl
PacI
.5μl
Fast Digest buffer
4μl
Cleaned-up PCR content
30μl
Then bain-marie at 37°C for one hour. Finally conduct PCR cleanup for both BioBricks, with 15µl of NE buffer.
We acidentally used PvuI instead of PacI. - SC 6/8/14
PCR pCola plasmide (Geranyl Synthase)
by melanie
amplification of geranyl Synthase
protocol
PCR protocol: 98° --> 2min
5 PCR cycle:
time
10sec
20sec
45sec
temperature
98°
(depending on the tube - see the gradient)
72°
25 PCR cycle
time
10sec
20sec
45sec
temperature
98°
72°
72°
and last step: 72° during 10min
but we don't have any results
Gel electrophoresis
by Sean,Pierre & Melanie
Samples used:
BBa_K762100 (2µl)
BBa_K517003 (2µl)
p cola(12µl)
Bibliography
By Hoang Vu
Still working on my mission: find more informations about limonene, pinene and citral A and B.I got now a couple of very interessant reviews about limonene and pinene.
