Salicylate Inducible Suppressing System
Transformation of competent E.coli cells
by Fabio
We transformed in DH5α the Ligation's result made yesterday (BBa_K1372000 with BBa_B0015). The samples were put at 37°C for 10 hours, then we put them at room temperature until monday morning)
Samples:
Sample 2 μl
Sample 1 μl
DH5α Control in LB
DH5α Control in LB + Cm
Results on 11th August morning:
Success, grown very well (> 200 colonies)
Success, grown well (> 100 colonies)
Success, a film of bacteria has settled
Success, nothing has grown

Lemon Scent
PCR
by Mélanie & Pierre We have done a PCR with pcola (geranyl synthase) and BBa_K517003:
Green GotaqBuffer = 10µl
MgCl2 = 4µl
dNTP  = 1µl
Primer A = 1µM
Primer B = 1µM
DNA = 1µl
Gotaq DNA polymerase = 0.25µl
Oligo used : iPS81bis AND iPS82 (pcola) iPS69 and iPS68bis (BBa_K517003)
PCR cycles:
95° 2min
95° 30sec
49-55° 30 sec
72° 2min
71° 5min
Electrophoresis
10 µl of BBa_K517003
10 µl of BBa_K517003

Purification of the previous PCR
by Pierre
From the 5 tubes of p.Cola I cleaned up two tubes. From the 5 tubes of BBa_K517003 I cleaned up two tubes.
I did an electroforesis to check if the clening has worked. It did.
1 µl of BBa_K517003
1 µl of p. cola
Stock of pcola plasmides

Human Practices
Art & Design
by Terry
Sequel of yesterday molding attempt.
The mold is cut delicately and the test piece removed.
Then, the mold is placed back in the becher and filled up with regular agar ( 20mg/ml )
Result : FAILURE, the agar test piece has been ripped when unmolding. It was stuck to the mold.
But the mold is still intact ! I cleaned it up and slightly covered the inward surface with liquid soap. The mold is filled up again and conserved in the refrigerator for 2 hours.
Result : SUCCESS, I slightly remoistened the gel with water for an easier unmolding. The agar test piece is perfectly removed.
