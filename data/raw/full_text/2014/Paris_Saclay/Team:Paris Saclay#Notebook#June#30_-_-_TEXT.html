Transformations
by Maher & Mathias
We use the E. coli DH5α supercompetent cells provided by our advisors for the aforementioned Biobricks. Spread on petri dishes with the concentration 10-1 and 10-2.
Preparations
by Marie and Mathieu
Aliquots of antibiotics
Put 0.203g of Chloramphenicol in 10ml of ethanol. Aliquots of 1ml. (Do the same for Kanamycin and Ampicillin)
by Romain
Petri dishes (with antiobiotics)
Add 250µl of antibiotics in 250ml of LAG. Pour in Petri dishes.
by Arnaud
Range of gelose with different concentration of agar
Add in 6 bottles of 500ml 2g of LB (lysogeny broth), and in each bottle add successively 1500mg (15mg/ml), 2000mg (20mg/ml), 2500mg (25mg/ml), 3000mg (30mg/ml), 3500mg (35mg/ml) and 4000mg (40mg/ml) of agar. And just before autoclaving complete each bottle with 100ml of reverse osmosis-purified water.
