Lab Work
The frame coli Odor free
Preparation of electrocompetent cells
by Romain
Strain used: E. coli MG1655Z1 and E. coli MG1655.
Protocol:
Two dilution of 500µl of bacterial culture MG1655Z1 and E. coli MG1655 in 15ml of LB at 30°C for each strain.
When the culture OD650 = 0,6:
put in ice during 10min.
centriguge at 4°C, 5min, 4000rpm.
Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 15ml glycerol 10% COLD.
centriguge at 4°C, 5min, 4000rpm.
Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 15ml glycerol 10% COLD.
centriguge at 4°C, 5min, 4000rpm.
Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 200µl glycerol 10% COLD.
Transformation of electrocompetent cells
by Romain
Strain used: E. coli MG1655Z1 and E. coli MG1655. Plasmid used: BT340 (code for a flipase for E. coli)
Make 2 electroporations in cold electroporation cuvettes:
A control cuvette(without DNA): 50µl of E. coli MG1655Z1 or E. coli MG1655.
A second cuvette: 50µl of E. coli MG1655Z1 or E. coli MG1655 culture + 1µl of BT640 plasmid.
Electroporation : 2500V, 132W, 40µF.
After that, add 1ml of cold LB in each cuvette and transfer in 2 tubes.
Incubate during 1h at 30°C.
Spread on 8 dishes LB + Cm:
20µl of control E. coli MG1655Z1 (without plasmid)
50µl of transformed E. coli MG1655Z1 with BT340.
100µl of transformed E. coli MG1655Z1 with BT340.
Transformed and concentrated E. coli MG1655Z1 with BT340.
20µl of control E. coli MG1655 (without plasmid)
50µl of transformed E. coli MG1655 with BT340.
100µl of transformed E. coli MG1655 with BT340.
Transformed and concentrated E. coli MG1655Z1 with BT340.
Incubate for a night at 30°C.
Salicylate Inducible Suppressing System
DNA purification gel agarose
by Fabio
Once the segregate process made yesterday by electrophoresis, the DNA correspondent to the core of BBa_J61051 was purified from the gel agarose.
Segregate Process Protocol
Ligation
by Fabio
The final step to have a BioBrick Assembly is the Ligation reaction.
TODO: illustration of the process
BioBrick BBa_J61051 (Salicylate promoter + NahR) as Part A

PCR of BBa_K762100
by Sean
This was a second attempt at yesterday 's PCR, with several changes in parameters. Two tubes were prepared: one with yesterday's enzyme and another with a newer version of the same enzyme in order to determine if yesterday's enzyme was one of the causes of the rather unsatisfactory results.
Oligonucleotides used: iPS66, iPS67
Oligonucleotides were diluted twice from 100µM to 50µM.
Protocol
Add into each PCR tube the following:
Component
For a total volume of 50μl
H2O
35.5μl
Phusion buffer 5X
10μl
dNTPs
