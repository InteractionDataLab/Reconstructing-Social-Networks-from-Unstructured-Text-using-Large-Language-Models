Lab Work
Construction of the fusion protein
'by Hoang Vu'
We picked out white colonies from Xgal-IPTG petri dish and blue colonies found in non Xgal-IPTG petri dish in a petri dish that contain Ampicillin to check if the blue ones are not came from a carrying of Xgal-IPTG during the precedent pick out.
Lemon scent

Limone synthase
We had a problem to clone LS in pGMETeasy and pPSI. So from the dish of streaking from 26 August We do PCR of all the clones:
We use the Protocol - PCR for bacterial culture and we use the same PCR condition than on the August 8 but with the appropriate Primer and Biobrick.
PPS5
We check if we have the right insert in our plasmid pPS5 : CAD (cinnalyl alcool deshydrogenase) So we do a PCR in the same condition than August 20
PPS3 and PPS4
We need to work on this plasmid tomorrow so we do some culture from the stock
