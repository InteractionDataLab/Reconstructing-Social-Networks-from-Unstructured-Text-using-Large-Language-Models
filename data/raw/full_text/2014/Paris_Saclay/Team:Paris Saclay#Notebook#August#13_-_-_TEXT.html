Lemon scent
culture of pJBEI6409 bacteria
by Mélanie
culture in LB of some clones obtain yesterday
Gel electrophoresis of BBa_K762100
by Sean
Samples used: 5µl from each tube prepared 12th August
Contents of the two tubes yielding the highest intensity were pooled.
PCR clean-up of BBa_K762100
by Sean
PCR clean-up was conducted on the contents of the two tubes pooled earlier.
Gel electrophoresis of BBa_K762100
by Sean
Sample used: the result of the PCR clean-up conducted today.
Concentration of BBa_K762100 is very low — the band is only slightly visible.

Culture of transformed bacteria
We used 3 colony of bacteria transformed with PJBEI+Apra (11/08) to lauch 3 cultures
-two cultures in 5mL LB+Apra (1/2000)
-one culture in 20mL LB+Apra (1/2000)
37°C - 24h

Human Practices
Art & Design
by Terry
Unmolding yesterday 's preparation. The mold was not hermetically closed, the chromoprotein is expressed in presence of oxygen.
It looks like blue tasty space cake but...
...when unmolded, you can only see a little ring of blue at 100% ( non-diluted preculture ).In fact, bacteria didn't grow.
There are no nutrients in agar, bacteria won't grow without appropriate medium. I can't use LB because of its color. I must find a colorless medium.
