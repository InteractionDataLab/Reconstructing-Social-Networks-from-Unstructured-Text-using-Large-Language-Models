Lab work
Transformation of competent E.coli cells
by Fabio, Maher and Romain
We transformed in DH5α the following Biobrick:
BBa_J23119
Samples:
Concentrated
Undiluted
Diluted 10-1
Control
Results:
Concentrated: 99 colonies
Undiluted: 5 colonies
Diluted: 0
Control: 0
Conclusion: Since the first transformations experiments with the iGEM's Biobricks, none of the diluted samples have grown. The undiluted ones have grown in some cases. We conclude that for future experiments and mainly for the project, we must use concentrated cultures.
