The frame coli Odor free
Stria on LB dishes
by Romain
Strains used: MG1655 and MG1655Z1, transformed the 30th July , striated on 4 LB dishes per strain.
Salicylate Inducible Suppressing System
Liquid Culture
by Fabio
8 liquid cultures with 3ml of LB and 3µl of amp (at 10am - 8°C), all from the colonies made the 31st July . The colonies will be put at 37°C on sunday 3rd in order to have grown colonies on monday.
Lemon scent
Results of the Transformation of electrocompetent cells
by Arnaud & Terry
Transformation of electrocompetent cells made the July 29th. Strains used: DY330. Plasmid used: pJBEI-6409 (code for enzymes to produce limonene from glucose in E. coli)
Results:
Nothing has grown on the control dishes.
Failure, nothing has grown on the dishes which contain DY330 with pJBE1
New Transformation of electrocompetent cells
by Terry
Strain used: DY330. Plasmid used: pJBEI-6409 (code for enzymes to produce limonene from glucose in E. coli)
Make 3 électroporations in cold electroporation cuvettes:
A control cuvette(without DNA): 50µl of DY330.
A second cuvette: 50µl of DY330 culture + 2µl of pJBEI-6409 plasmid.
A third cuvette: 50µl of DY330 culture + 0.5µl of pJBEI-6409 plasmid.
Electroporation : 2500V, 132W, 40µF.
After that, add 1ml of cold LB in each cuvette and transfer in tubes to incubate during 1 to 2h at 30°C.
Spread on 7 dishes LB + Cm:
100µl of control (without plasmid)
50µl of transformed DY330 with 0.5µl of pJBEI-6409
100µl of transformed DY330 with 0.5µl of pJBEI-6409
The rest of transformed DY330 with 0.5µl pJBEI-6409
50µl of transformed DY330 with 2µl of pJBEI-6409
100µl of transformed DY330 with 2µl of pJBEI-6409
The rest of transformed DY330 with 2µl pJBEI-6409
Incubate for 2 days at 30°C.
