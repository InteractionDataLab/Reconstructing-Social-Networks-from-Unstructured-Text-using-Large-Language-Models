Preparation of DH5a CaCl2 Competent cell
Protocol
Lemon Scent
by Melanie
From the 20 ml of odor free culture (pJBEI Apra - pPSI) done yesterday (by Laetitia)
Plasmid extraction without Nucleospin protocol
+ Stock (DH5a pJBEI + apra)
Transformation of DH5α
by Sean & Eugene
(Cacl2 protocol)
We prepare a LB agar environment with a concentration of:
0.5 mM of IPTG
0.008% of Xgal
1/2000 of Ampicilline
and we spread our preparation in a petri dish and incubate overnight at 37°C.
Human Practices
Art & Design
by Terry
We found an interesting colorless medium named M63.
Preparation of M63 medium, concentration 5X, one liter basis :
10g (NH4)2 SO4
68g KH2 PO4
2.5mg FeSO4 7H2O
Adjust to pH 7 with KOH
The concentrated medium is diluted to 1X with sterile water and the following solution ( one liter basis ) :
1 ml 1M MgSO4 7H2O
10 ml 20% carbon source (sugar or glycerol)
0.1 ml 0.5% vitamin B1
100 ml of M63 has been prepared for future manipulations.
