Team Members
Rakesh Arul
Rakesh is in the second year of Chemical Engineering conjoint with Chemistry and Biology. He is interested in synthetic & systems biology and how they can be translated into improving human healthcare. He originally did undergraduate research in solid state chemistry and spectroscopy, so he is keen to learn more about biology from more experienced team members!
Olivia Fernandes
Olivia is a third year Biology and Environmental Science student. She is interested in industrial microbiology. Synthetic Biology enables her to be creative and also apply her knowledge and skills into a real world project. Outside of science, she is actively involved in parish life and community groups.
Abdirizak Warsame
Abdirizak studied biology at undergraduate level with an interest in microbiology and biochemistry. Abdirizak is always willing to learn and meet like-minded people and have accomplished both these by joining the iGEM team.
Jessica Chiang
Jessica is enthusiastic about synthetic biology and is an environmentally conscious individual. She engaged in research and designed the logo. She hopes the synthetic biology can bring in a new perspective in the manufacturing industry and will not hesitate to learn more about the link between synthetic biology and the environmental equilibrium.
Jonathan Liu
Jonathan is a third year biological science student with an interest in synthetic biology. He is in charge of the team and liaises with academic staff and sponsors.
Daniel Neuberger
Daniel is a third year biomedical student. An eager individual, he was the capable person who underwent the beaten and weathered path of securing sponsors.
Senior Staff
Professor Richard Gardner – Project supervisor
Richard Gardner played a vital part in the project, assisting us with the interpretation of the literature as well as aiding in the gene designs. His expertise and bright attitude guided the project along through the tough times.
Dr Klaus Bernd Lehnert – Project advisor
Klaus Lehnert aided us in thinking broadly about the project. To not be burden down by the complications before you have even started. His open minded approach revealed to us ways we haven’t thought of.
Mr Keith David Richards – Lab supervisor
Keith Richards, knowledgeable and skilled, taught us the essence of what it means to work in the lab and enjoy it. Patient and guiding, he helped us bring the project from paper to reality.
Dr Siouxsie Wiles – Project advisor
Siouxsie Wiles provided us with knowledge and guidance regarding the project, bringing the fears of the project not working to an end.
Emeritus Professor Dick Alfred Bellamy – Sponsorship advisor
Dick Bellamy, with his trove and knowledge and experience, showed us how to walk through the harsh environment of sponsorship with style.
We would like to thank Thermo Fischer, Auckland University school of Biological Sciences and Auckland University Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences for their sponsorship
