gBlocks
All gBlocks were ordered from IDT.
gBlocks are prepared to a standard 200ng per tube by IDT.
We reconstituted gBlocks in 10μL EB or TE buffer, for a final concentration of 20ng/μL.
Below is a table of sequences of all gBlocks ordered for use in the USyd-Australia 2014 iGEM project, accompanied by a brief description of its application
