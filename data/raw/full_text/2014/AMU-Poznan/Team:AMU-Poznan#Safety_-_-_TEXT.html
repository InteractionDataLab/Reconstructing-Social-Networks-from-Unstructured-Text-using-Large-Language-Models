MODELING & SURVEY
Safety
We perform really safe research :). We don't have wet lab, we only work on computers. However, creating our software we care about data safety and user anonymity. Any user can register account on web version of our software, what makes accessing your earlier results really easy. We ensure privacy and anonymity of each user. We also needed to ensure safety of database to prevent unwanted changes by third party.
Our Lab
If you go to the 'team' tab you can see how we work, we usually just sit somewhere within University (Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciences) and code. We use Macbooks and iOS (and Windows through Bootcamp). We are now changing our server (during wikifreeze so maybe we will give you some details on Jamboree) - so there will be problems with accesing web version of our software (but it will be fixed before Jamboree).
