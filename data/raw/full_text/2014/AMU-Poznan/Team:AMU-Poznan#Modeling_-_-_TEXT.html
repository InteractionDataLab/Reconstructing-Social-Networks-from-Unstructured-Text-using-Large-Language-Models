MODELING & SURVEY
Create your free online surveys with SurveyMonkey , the world's leading questionnaire tool.
Here we present Survey results and Modeling results (for Modeling results please scroll down the page)
Survey
14.10.2014
31 survey responses:
what survey answerers think that RNAi is
what they think that sh-miRs are
what they think that shRNAs are
what literature do they know about sh-miRs
what they find important in bioinformatic software
what they find important in sh-miR designer
how long will they wait for software response
survey answerers
their sex
and age
Conclusions
Knowledge of RNAi is good. however people do not know what exactly sh-miR is. Users are eager to wait up to 8h, 24h only 50% and 2 days only 20% (work without software will take 2 days). What are the most important features of bioinformatic software: user-friendly interface documentation easy user-guide fast response from software what is important in shmiR designer: speed of software possibilty to choose miRNA scaffold experimental evaluation
Modeling
We decided to pay more attention to model sh-miR molecules with different RNA 2D structure prediction software (we use RNAfold in our software). Here are our results (however we only show modeling of one molecule the conclusions are obvious - we performed folding for over 10 molecules):

RNAstructure
RNAfold
Conclusions
Different algorithms gives very different results. To have the most reliable structure it recommended to check the structure with different software.
