Questionnaire
We decided to take a survey to know what those around us and the general public think about synthetic biology and genetic engineering technology.
We prepared the questionnaire on the Web not only in Japanese but also in English to gather opinions widely.
We spread the URL to access the format to answer by utilizing SNS such as Facebook.
We would like to appreciate all the people who answered the questionnaire.
By 5 p.m. on 17th of October, we received 410 replies in Japanese version and 161 replies in English version.
We obtained cooperation from iGEM UI Indonesia. Thus especially many responses from Indonesia were received. We answered the questionnaire from iGEM UI Indonesia.
The results of the survey are shown below.
The green pie charts show the results of all responses, the blue ones show those of JAPANESE version, and the red ones show those of ENGLISH version.
The results of ENGLISH version include responses from following countries.
Q1 : What kind of image do you have of “genetic modification”?
The most common answer is “Amazing”. The second one is “Advanced”. Many people have positive image for genetic modification.
Q2 : What kind of image do you have of “Escherichia. Coli”?
The most common answer is “Good for science”, but second one is “Dirty”. The result from Q1, people have positive impression for genetic modification, but the impression of E.coli is negative. It indicates that the fact E.coli used at genetic modification is not known very well.
Q3 : What do you use to exterminate cockroach?
The most people used a bug bump to exterminate cockroaches. It means that people ask for fast-acting pesticide.
Q4 : What kind of image do you have of insecticide?
Japanese people more generally have that insecticide is useful compared with foreign people. Japanese people may have little awareness about environment or influence of insecticide.
Q5 : What do you think about exterminating cockroach with E. coli?
The most people are interested in exterminating cockroaches by E. coli.  This survey indicates that the synthetic biology application resolving daily life problem such as our project, Exterminator coli, would help us to promote better understanding for general people who have negative impression against E. coli and/or synthetic biology.
