Tokyo NoKoGen 2014 is built up of 8 students, 4 advisors, and 3 instructors. Student members through discussion with the advisors and instructors decided our project concepts. All laboratory works were only done by student members in the laboratories at the Department of Biotechnology and Life Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. Our wiki was designed by Madoka Nagata and constructed by lab members. Sponsors only supported by providing laboratories to work at, experimental materials, and funding. All team members very much enjoyed doing our project and greatly appreciate assistance. Prof. Ferri, Prof. Ikebukuro, and Prof. Sode for all their supports.
