Meet the team!
Tiffany Kwakwa
Tiffany loves french fries and the colors pink and sea foam green.  She is a rising junior studying Environmental Engineering and how to recycle and reuse everything.  In her spare time she can be found in bakeries or drinking tea.
Kristi Lui
Kristi has an odd sense of humor and is basically the wild child.  When not pipetting, she’s usually watching one of many TV shows (but mainly Dexter) or studying for the MCAT.
Mitch Perkins
Mitch is a potential Anthropology major, but currently focusing on Biology.  Constantly greeting team members with a “Yo!” and sharing pictures of his dog, there is no one else as chill, except maybe the -80 fridge.
Sharon Chen
When not studying for the MCAT, Sharon is in the lab or sleeping.  Mainly sleeping.  A rising senior Art History and Biology major, she loves cherries and expensive oatmeal.
David Lee
David is a rising star who has also risen into our hearts with his wit and charm.  The other departments are jealous that he chose Biomedical Engineering.  His only vice is his addiction to Game of Thrones, finishing 10 episodes in one night after returning from a day at the lab.
Adam Baker
Adam is a bassist and speed reader, going through multiple books in one sitting as well as the technical papers related to our project.  He’s a rising junior Chemical Engineer who we fall back on for knowledge and fact recollection.
Abdullah Memon
Abdullah has been graced with the gift of amazing handwriting and tasteful quips.  He’s a rising junior on a pre-med track to saving lives and making fat stacks.
Meet the advisors!
Dr. Josh Leonard Assistant Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering
Dr. Mike Jewett Assistant Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering
Dr. Keith Tyo Assistant Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering
Dr. John C Mordacq Distinguished Senior Lecturer of Biological Sciences at Northwestern University
Meet the grad students who helped us!
Will Bothfeld Tyo Lab
When there is a will, there is a way. Our biggest thank-you goes to our official TA of the summer!
Graduate Student in Chemical Engineering, Started 2012/University of Wisconsin – Madison, B.S. Biochemistry & Biology, 2010/Project: Experimental Metabolic Engineering
Karthik Sekar Tyo Lab
From navigating the iGEM parts page to using the plate reader, Karthik was with us every step of the way!
PhD Candidate in Chemical Engineering, Started 2010/University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, B.S. Biomedical Engineering, 2009/Project: Computational & Experimental Metabolic Engineering
Sarah Steinbrook Tyo Lab
Not only is Sarah super quick when replying our emergency "what to do" emails, she is also the master of troubleshooting - anything and everything - especially the elusive colony PCR.
Graduate Student in IBiS, Started 2014/Ohio University, B.S. Molecular Biology/Project: Signaling Engineering
Joe Muldoon Leonard Lab
Joe! Our beloved iGEM veteran, modeling guru, and let's-talk-math person! We will miss those meetings in the ChemE lab!
Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences Graduate Program (IBiS)/B.S. in Biology, B.S. in Chemistry, University of Virginia 2013/Research Interests: Systems and synthetic immunology and “knowing is half the battle.”
Andrew Younger Leonard Lab
Without Andrew's help, we would still be running a million gels a day and not knowing why nothing was showing up. No, he assured us that DNA was not suddenly positive. The buffer was wrong, that's all.
Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences Graduate Program (IBiS)/B.S. in Molecular Genetics, University of Rochester 2011/Research Interests: Bacterial Synthetic Biology, Metabolic engineering
Jian Li Jewett Lab
We cannot thank Jian enough for his guidance in growing S.rimosus and his kindness in letting us borrow chemicals.
B.S. Anhui Agricultural University (AAU), Hefei, China /Ph.D., TU Berlin/Project: in vitro protein synthesis
Rey Martin Jewett Lab
We love your passion for your work, your smile, and your enthusiasm when teaching us! Thank you for providing us with your spreadsheet and protocols! And thank you for giving us reagents to begin our research!
NSF Graduate Fellow, Ford Foundation Fellow/Chemical and Biological Engineering, B.S., UCLA/Project: Protein synthesis
Simon Yang iGEM 2013
Simon Yang is a master's student in biomedical engineering. He was also part of Northwestern's 2013 igem team.
Thank you sponsors!
