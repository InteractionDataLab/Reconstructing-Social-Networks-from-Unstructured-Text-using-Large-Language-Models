Spinach Aptamer Construct
The part that we submitted is a construct that incorporates a RFP and spinach aptamer gene along with ECORI, BamHI,XbaI, and SpeI/PstI. The construction of this part was designed such that transcriptional and translational rates of different organisms could be measured through spinach aptamer fluorescence and RFP fluorescence, respectively. To obtain this measurement, a RBS must first be ligated into the construct- which we accounted for in both the design of all our RBS as well as the construct itself. The XbaI restriction site, once cut, complements the design of our annealed RBS oligonucleotides that have been fashioned with a "cut" XbaI site on one side and SpeI site on the other. For our project, we ligated in our part - with a variety of RBS - into iGEM biobrick backbone and, using a cell-free system (lysates of different organisms), with the intention of characterizing the part in various, non-model organisms.
