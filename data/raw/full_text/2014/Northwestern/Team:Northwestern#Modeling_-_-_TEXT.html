Modeling
The objective of our math model is to propose a way that experimental data obtained through use of our RFP-Spinach aptamer construct in a cell-free system can be used to better characterize genetic parts. Above is a series of graphs of the theoretical underpinnings on why we believe that our system can be used to give better quantitative measurement than current methods. Due to our ability to control inputs such as the amount T7 polymerase we put into our system, with proper knowledge of the decay rate of T7 polymerase, the activity of a promoter could be defined as the slope of a graph of [RNA]/[T7].
Our systems ability to also monitor both [RNA] and [DNA] real time allows us to create a power-law relation of [DNA]/[RNA] vs Time as show above. We hope that further experimentation in the future will be able to improve upon our foundation.
