Cell-Free Protein Synthesis
20140723 Testing our lysates
data from BL21 (E.Coli) lysates
out of K12, DH5a, and BL21, BL21 expressed the most fluorescence
the plasmid used was a construct of superfolder GFP from the Jewett Lab
conclusion:our lysates are functional
20140801 Making our own mastermix (iMM)!
RM: Rey's mastermix
iMM: we made our own according to Rey's recipe
looks like our mastermix works fine
conclusion: we will use our own mastermix from now on
the second part: we made s. rimosus lysates
we used a sfgfp construct from the Jewett lab
the lysates seem to express some gfp!
20140915 All of our lysates
RBS B0034
Tried all of our lysates
green fluorescence indicates mRNA levels of transcription
red fluorescence indicates protein levels of translation
conclusion: the data is most likely statistically insignificant
20141014 Cell-Free Protein Synthesis Assay with All of our Lysates
We used RBS No. 5 (B0034) with RFP-Spinach Aptamer
Displayed here is the first read
The kinetic portion of the plate reader did not record data in all of our wells
We will continue doing CFPS experiments
conclusion: we need more time! Looks like fluorophores were incorrectly added
