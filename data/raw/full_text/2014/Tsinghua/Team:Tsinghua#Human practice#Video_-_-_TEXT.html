Return to: Human Practice
With the belief that education and propagation of science is at least, if not more, as important as the actual research, we made a short cartoon video to tell a story about viruses. Though the term of virus originates from Greek iso poison, leaving the impression of terror; the viruses are increasingly recognized as valuable tools for biomedical research, as well as the clinical treatment. Here, we describe the basic knowledge about viruses’ structure and typical life cycle. Enjoy the video at Youtube.
