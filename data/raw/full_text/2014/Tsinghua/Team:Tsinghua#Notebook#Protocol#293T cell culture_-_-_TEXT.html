293T Cell Culture Protocol
Buffers:
Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
Reagent
Final    concentration (1X)
NaCl
137mM
KCl
2.7mM
Na2HPO4
10mM
KH2PO4
1.8mM
Adjust pH to 7.2-7.4. Autoclave before use.
 
Cell  culture: 293T cells were grown in DMEM (invitrogen)  supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) at 37oC in 5% CO2  using 100mm culture dish.
 
Subculture:
Check the confluence of the  cell using an inverted microscope. Prepare to sub-culture the cells when they  reach ~80% confluence.
Carefully aspirate old medium from  the cells.
Gently wash the cells with 3ml PBS.
Add 3mL of new media to  resuspend cells by pipetting up and down, and avoid frothing of medium.
Pipette 700ul of the cell  suspension into a new 100mm culture dish containing 10-12mL new media.
Renew the media after 24h.
Cells should be reaching 80% confluence  again after 48h of last subculture.
