Face to face interaction with doctors and patients at Peking University First Hospital
We paid a visit to Peking University First Hospital in Beijing and discussed with the doctors and patients.
“Diabetes Mellitus has become the main concern of public health in China in the past 30 years, especially the type II Diabetes Mellitus.”said by Doctor Wang of the Endocrinology Department. There are various causes for the increasingly high morbidity: high-fat diet, reduction in physical output, high pressure and environmental pollution. However, Dr. Wang holds a positive attitude towards the treatment for this common disease and highly supports the development of potential gene therapy, which may bring evolutionary changes.
In the hospital, there are posters for regularly held lectures about diabetes, which help to build a community between patients and specialists. Also, there are free devices like self-service rapid glucometer that make it convenient for the patients to monitor their condition.

Talking About iGEM
iGEM seminar for Tsinghua undergrads
In collaboration with our buddy team, Tsingua-A , we held a seminar among Tsinghua undergraduates. We told the story of iGEM, synthetic biology, and discussed various aspects of our projects. Hopefully we have persuaded even more fellow scholars to join the ranks of iGEMer's.
