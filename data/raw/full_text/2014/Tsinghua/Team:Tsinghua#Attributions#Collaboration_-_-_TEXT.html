TEAM
Collaboration
As one of the 254 teams that have joined the big family of iGEM, we are trying our best to meet new friends and offer help to those who are in need. That is one thing that makes this competition interesting and beautiful, it not all about competing, but also about communicating and collaborating.
Collaboration with Tsinghua-A
Assisted Tsinghua-A in preparing their parts for submission
Mutual sharing of lab resources (enzymes/flow cytometer)
Constant communication on iGEM news and requirements
Held joint seminar on iGEM for Tsinghua Undergrads
We have been in close collaboration with another team from our home university, Tsinghua-A . They are excellent team and are doing amazing work. We feel very happy that we were able to give them hands on their experiment and part submission. It was also quite exciting when we were holding a mini-symposium together for students in our school. We talked about our projects and also tried to present the beauty of synthetic biology to junior students.
Collaboration with NUDT-China
We sent 8 of our parts from our team DNA repository to NUDT-China team to help them start their experiments. Some of these parts were created by Team Tsinghua for iGEM 2013 and others were from the DNA distribution kit from 2013.
Collaboration with BNU-China
Provided consultation when BNU-China started their first team
Our team has been participating in iGEM for the past five years and much experience has been passed down from one generation to another. As such an experienced team, we are very willing to help out those new teams which probably join the iGEM for the first time this year. This is what we did for the team from Beijing Normal University ( BNU-China ). They are a team of rising stars and are willing to take initiative. We are very happy to be able to help. The two teams scheduled several meetings and we were having a wonderful time.
Communication with Other Teams
It is natural for contestants to be curious about what their competitors are doing. The forum organized by NCTU provided a perfect opportunity for every team attended to satisfy their curiosity. During the Forum, we communicated with teams from universities all over China. Posters and presentations were made to introduce every team’s design and progress; questions were raised as well as helpful advices. Every one attended really touched the thrill of iGemer’s happiness, and got home fully load.
We are very lucky to have the opportunity to join the big family of iGEM and put our ideas into reality, and it is even luckier that we are able to witness the clash of ideas and the genesis of even crazier ideas. Collaboration is what makes this competition complicated but is also what makes it inspiring and long-lasting.
