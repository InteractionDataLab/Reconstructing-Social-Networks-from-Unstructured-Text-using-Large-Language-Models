Pneumosensor Data Page
This page shows all the parts we have made or used in our whole project. Click on the links below to see our constructs on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts in detail. Please visit our characterization page for an overview of our measurements with those parts and our result page for other results.
How our system works:
Data For Our Favorite New Parts:
σx, BBa_K1379004 : gene sequence of competence protein ComX which produces σx factor. σx factor induces promoter containing Com-Box sequence (PcelA and PcomFA).
PcelA promoter, BBa_K1379000 : a σx-inducible promoter (containing Com-Box sequence) which initiates the transcription of competence CelA protein.
PcomFA promoter, BBa_K1379001 : a σx-inducible promoter (containing Com-Box sequence) which initiates the transcription of ComFA protein.
Data for Pre-existing Parts:
Strong promoter, strong RBS combination, BBa_K880005 (Team Michigan iGEM, 2012): combination of strong constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23100 ) and strong RBS ( BBa_B0034 ) was used as a backbone for a very high level of expression of ComX protein (σx factor).
GFP generator, BBa_E0240 (Antiquity Boston University iGEM, 2004): green fluorescent protein reporter ( BBa_E0040 ) with RBS ( BBa_B0032 ) and double terminator ( BBa_B0015 ) was used as a reporter for characterization of PcelA and PcomFA promoters.
We Also Built and Characterized the Following Parts:
σx Generator, BBa_K1379006 : comX gene sequence was assembled with constitutive promoter, RBS and double terminator so ComX protein is produced constitutively.
PcelA-GFP Generator, BBa_K1379002 : σx-inducible PcelA promoter was assembled with GFP generator.
PcomFA-GFP Generator, BBa_K1379003 : σx-inducible PcomFA promoter was assembled with GFP generator.
σx Generator, PcelA-GFP Generator, BBa_K1379005 : σx-generator was assembled with PcelA-GFP generator. Following the assemblage of both constructs, GFP was successfully expressed.
σx Generator, PcomFA-GFP Generator, BBa_K1379007 : σx-generator was assembled with PcomFA-GFP generator. Following the assemblage of both constructs, GFP was successfully expressed.
We Built but did not Characterize the Following Parts:
comE, BBa_K1379051 : gene sequence of response regulator ComE which induces the PcomCDE promoter.
Riboregulator Data Page
This page shows all the parts we have made or used in our whole project. Click on the links below to see our constructs on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts in detail.
Data for parts with qualified sample in the Part Registry:
Lock 1, BBa_J01008 (Golden Bear, 2005): BioBricked version of Isaacs' riboregulator trans-activating key, taR12
Lock3c, BBa_J23031 (Team Berkeley iGEM, 2006): lock3c
Encodes a short RNA sequence that "unlocks" the biobrick part J01122 (lock3) which is locked RFP, BBa_J23008 (Berkeley iGEM, 2006): Key 3c
Data and submitted physical DNA for parts without qualified sample in the Part Registry:
Inducible pBad/araC promoter, BBa_I0500 : Inducible pBad/araC promoter
Riboregulator Lock 1, BBa_J01010 : Biobrick version of Isaacs' riboregulator cis repressed lock, crR12
Lock3, BBa_J01080 : Biobrick version of Isaacs' riboregulator cis repressed lock, crR12, and modified version of Riboregulator Lock 1
Key3, BBa_J01086 : Biobricked version of Isaacs' riboregulator trans activating key, taR12, and modified version of Riboregulator Key 1
Lock for medium RBS (B0032) from the lock/key library TUD09, BBa_K175031 : This biobrick generates a mRNA which forms a secondary structure blocking the (medium) RBS.
Key for lock of medium (K175031) RBS (B0032) from the lock/key library TUD09, BBa_K175032 : This biobrick generates a mRNA which forms a secondary structure that opens LMR (K175031).
B0034 derived RBS to match spacing of J01122, BBa_J23080 : RBS spacing modification to [RBS] such that the spacing between the shine-delgarno and the ORF is the same as it is in J01122.
Data and submitted physical DNA for constructs used in characterization:
RBS(Lock 3c), BBa_K1379015 : B0032 derivate for Lock 3C
Lock 1-GFP-B0015, BBa_K1379020 : Cis-repressed GFP Generator Lock 1

RBS(Lock 1)-GFP-B0015, BBa_K1379046 : GFP generator using a Lock 1 modified RBS
RBS(Lock 3c)-GFP-B0015, BBa_K1379047 : GFP generator using a Lock 3C modified RBS
