Prof. King Lau CHOW
Division of Life Science, HKUST
Professor King L. Chow earned his PhD in Cell Biology from the Baylor College of Medicine. After spending some years as a Belfer Center Fellow in the       Molecular Genetics Department at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, he returned to Hong Kong to assume an Assistant Professorship at HKUST. Professor       Chow is now concurrently holding the position of Professor of Life Science, Associate Director of the Bioengineering Program, Director of the Molecular Biomedical      Sciences Program and Associate Dean of Students. Professor Chow’s research work spans a broad spectrum of biological sciences, including molecular genetics,       genomics, neural developmental biology, the evolution of behavior and synthetic biology.
Dr. Jessica Ce Mun TANG
Division of Life Science, HKUST
This is the fourth year that she has been an instructor for the HKUST iGEM team. She is satisfied seeing everyone working as a team. She thinks that is it great       because although the members are under pressure to get the results, everyone can still remain calm and happy!
