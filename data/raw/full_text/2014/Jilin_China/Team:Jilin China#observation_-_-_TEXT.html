Investigation of The South Lake and SongHua Lake
In order to investigate the dangers of algae bloom,the JLU-china iGEM team visited The South lake and the Songhua lake in jilin.algae outbreaks there,and the JLU-china team also held a interview with the local people.
In july 2nd ,we visited the South lake in changchun,it was sunny ouside,so,many people played here.but there was strong overwhelming scent,and the fish was dead,floating on the surface.these are all caused by algae bloom.
And we did some water sampling in South lake
Aad we also visited the Songhua lake in jilin,the water quality of Songhua lake is so worrying. Just like the South lake.The algae bloom destroys the beautiful scenery and the beautiful mood of people.
We held an interview with some local people,asked them what influence did the algae bloom made on their daliy life,and were they worryed about the algae bloom.
