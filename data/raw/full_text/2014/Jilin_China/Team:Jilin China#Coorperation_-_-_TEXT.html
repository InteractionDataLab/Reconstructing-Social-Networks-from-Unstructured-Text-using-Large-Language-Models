NanJing University and Peking University             Communication and support   JLU, NJU and PKU were working on a similar task: deletion and degradation of Microcystin LR, a toxin from algae bloom which can damage human’s liver, we communicated and exchange our ideas during this summer holiday. We found the enzyme coded by MlrA can degrade this toxin and a membrane protein coded by MlrD can transfer MC-LR from outside to inside of the cell. In spite of the theory discussion, we received the MlrD gene from NanJing University. We show our gratitude to NanJing University.
Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan University and so on      Exchange ideas We compete in iGEM for the first time this year, so there are still many issues to be resolved. The first Huazhong iGEM Conversation offered opportunities for every university to exchange experiences with others. We understood lots of points about the competition, including how to show innovation points, how to finish a perfect wiki and so on. These issues provide thoughts and directions for following data processing and showing. Besides, some posters and shows we made in the communication have been ready for the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
Lanzhou University          Theoretical analysis When we synthesized pathways involved STAT-JAK, an advisor engaged in this filed from Lanzhou University gave us personal suggestions, which contributes to understand enzymes regulating PP2A better. There are no doubts the suggestions from the advisor help a lot for undergraduates who never contact this pathway. We express our heartfelt thanks for the advisor.
