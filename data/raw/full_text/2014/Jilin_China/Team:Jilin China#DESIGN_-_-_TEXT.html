How to find and degradation of microcystins LR?
Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is a naturally occurring  toxin released after the algal cells break down, which can do great damage to  liver,very stable and in some extent is very resistant to high temperature and  pH change, so it brings the water purification into a very embarrassing  situation.
Mlr promoter is able to detect whether  water containing microcystin LR and start to expressthe GFP-mlrA fusion protein.  GFP can emit green fluorescence, very simple and very sensitive to tell us the  water contains toxic microcystin LR. MlrA can directly degrade microcystin  LRand eliminate its toxicity, eliminate the toxins in water pollution.
The mlr promoter-GFP-mlrA was be cloned  into the E. coli-L. lactis shuttle  expression vector pMG36e, so it can be able to express in E. coli and Lactococcus lactis, which Can easily be  constructed in the laboratory, at the same time to avoid secondary pollution in  the natural environment of E. coli.
