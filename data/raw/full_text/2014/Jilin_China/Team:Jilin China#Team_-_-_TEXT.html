Hello,IGEMER!
This is our team's wiki,welcome to our zone!
Hello, everybody. I am Kevin Lee. My motto is ‘imagination is more important than knowledge’ by Albert Einstein. And I likethe work I did in Jilin_China team. I wish we can create a paradise for people using synthetic biology. Actually, the most important thing I learned through iGEM is using your imagination to create. We can learn from nature and use the biobricks that existed in nature. Genetic engineering will be the key star that shining around the world in the future and lead people to tomorrow. By the way, I love history, chemistry, biology, movies and music. If you want, contact me. We can be friend across country and culture.
Hi, my name isYingdong He. I am a junior studentstudying at Jilin University. My major in 4-year study career is chemistry, especially organic chemistry. For passion to total synthesis, I do some simple and essential synthesis of catalyst. As the same as reaction can be catalyzed by kinds of catalysts, I think my life is changed by every different changes. If I have spare time, I like relaxing outside, because the smell offresh air may be betterthan my father’s foot.
Hi, I am Shuwen Zhang, and I am a junior student from Jilin University, majoring in biology. I have always been taking biology as a way to touch the secret of nature. And, we have come so far. From last winter to this autumn, we are here to pursue our dream of biology. A world without microcystin? YES, we are leading you to it!
Hi, I am Zhang Endong, a junior at JLU, from South Eastof Chinaand majoring chemistry. Yeah, I am the guy who likes shopping. I had a terrific summer working with my friends at lab. I love my work in IGEM.In my spare time, I enjoy reading as well as staring blankly into the sky. We learn from the nature, and I believe we can make our life better with the bricks.
Hi,I am Peibo xu.They always call me Michael, from Michael Jackson, because I am a crazy fan of MJ. I also admire Jobs-- a artist who was living for changing world rather than a single merchant.  I love anything connecting with art--poem, music, film and beautiful science--biology, I believe that there is an another world in each cell---then, I have the cell, I have the world.
Hi, I’m Yujing Wang from Beijing in China. I’m a great fan of fencing, belly dance and shopping. Majoring in Biotechnology, I enjoy explore the fancy world of molecularbiology. I feel really happy to meet everybody here in Boston. Let’s start our GREAT JAMBOREE of iGEM.
Hi,I am Peng Wang. As a sophomore majoring in biology, I have been a crazy fun of biology for a long time. Of course, I won’t miss this great opportunity to get closer to biology. Surely, the IGEM is a competition. But for myself, I would rather to treat it as a long time chat when every member of this team try to exchange their own special ideas with each other. Although the daily work always try to bother me, I have learned a lot from this experience anyway.Thanks for my team and thanks for the IGEM.
Hi, I’m Zhuo Wan from Jilin University.As a student of Biology,i deeply love my major and want to explore it for my lifetime.I have broad interest,such as singing , elocnte and allegro.I’m very glad to be a member of igem,of course, the most happy thing is to meet all of you.Come on,friends!
I’m Guangyuan Song, the team leader of JiLin-China. Now I study in TangAoqing Class whose abbreviation is “Taq”, a famous DNA polymerase. And I have two goals: I want to be a biologist in the future and taste delicious food all the world.
Hi, I'm Lu Xiaotong, a junior student majoring in biology in JLU. I love my major because I'm crazy anout any novelties and I'm firmly convinced the biosome is the most fantastic stuff in the world. Moreover, I beieve that bioresearch will finally revolutionize our life now. Let' go for it!
Hi,I am Xuerui Zeng, a sophomore in Life Sciences school, Jilin University. I like reading and experimentation, love biology and psychology, social issues and environmental protection concerns. I hope to learn more about the world.
Hi,I am Qiang Fan from Jilin University in China and I major in Biology. I have been reflecting on the true drive force of organism, properly speaking, why organisms are so harmonious. That is exactly why I love biology so much. I take life as a magic of nature. And, by the way ,I am a unprofessional foodie…Cate, Cate , Cate, I love it….
Hi. my name is Jia Han. I have studied chemistry and biology in Jilin University in the first two and half years of my undergraduate period,then I study biopharmaceutics in Shenyang Pharmaceutical University. Though the joint training project, I find my professional interest in synthetic biology and systems biology especially their environmental,medical and pharmaceutical application to promote our health.so I take iGEM as a great opportunity to gain such experience.I enjoy reading and outdoor activities such as running、badminton、travel in free time ,I expect more chances to communicate with you who share common interest.
