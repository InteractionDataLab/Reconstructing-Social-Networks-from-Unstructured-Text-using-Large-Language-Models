Hi. my name is Jia Han. I have studied chemistry and biology in Jilin University in the first two and half years of my undergraduate period,then I study biopharmaceutics in Shenyang Pharmaceutical University. Though the joint training project, I find my professional interest in synthetic biology and systems biology especially their environmental,medical and pharmaceutical application to promote our health.so I take iGEM as a great opportunity to gain such experience.
Students
Hello, everybody. I am Kevin Lee. My motto is ‘imagination is more important than knowledge’ by Albert Einstein. And I likethe work I did in Jilin_China team. I wish we can create a paradise for people using synthetic biology. Actually, the most important thing I learned through iGEM is using your imagination to create. We can learn from nature and use the biobricks that existed in nature.By the way, I love history, chemistry, biology, movies and music.
Hi, my name is Yingdong He. I am a junior studentstudying at Jilin University. My major in 4-year study career is chemistry, especially organic chemistry. For passion to total synthesis, I do some simple and essential synthesis of catalyst. As the same as reaction can be catalyzed by kinds of catalysts, I think my life is changed by every different changes. If I have spare time, I like relaxing outside, because the smell offresh air may be betterthan my father’s foot.
Hi, I am Shuwen Zhang, and I am a junior student from Jilin University, majoring in biology. I have always been taking biology as a way to touch the secret of nature. And, we have come so far. From last winter to this autumn, we are here to pursue our dream of biology. A world without microcystin? YES, we are leading you to it!
Hi, I am Endong Zhang, a junior at JLU, from South Eastof Chinaand majoring chemistry. Yeah, I am the guy who likes shopping. I had a terrific summer working with my friends at lab. I love my work in IGEM.In my spare time, I enjoy reading as well as staring blankly into the sky. We learn from the nature, and I believe we can make our life better with the bricks.
Hi,I am Peibo Xu.They always call me Michael, from Michael Jackson, because I am a crazy fan of MJ. I also admire Jobs-- a artist who was living for changing world rather than a single merchant.  I love anything connecting with art--poem, music, film and beautiful science--biology, I believe that there is an another world in each cell---then, I have the cell, I have the world.
Hi, I’m Yujing Wang from Beijing in China. I’m a great fan of fencing, belly dance and shopping. Majoring in Biotechnology, I enjoy explore the fancy world of molecularbiology. I feel really happy to meet everybody here in Boston. Let’s start our GREAT JAMBOREE of iGEM.
Hi,I am Peng Wang. As a sophomore majoring in biology, I have been a crazy fun of biology for a long time. Of course, I won’t miss this great opportunity to get closer to biology. Surely, the IGEM is a competition. But for myself, I would rather to treat it as a long time chat when every member of this team try to exchange their own special ideas with each other. Although the daily work always try to bother me, I have learned a lot from this experience anyway.Thanks for my team and thanks for the IGEM
Hi, I’m Wan Zhuo from Jilin University.As a student of Biology,i deeply love my major and want to explore it for my lifetime.I have broad interest,such as singing , elocnte and allegro.I’m very glad to be a member of igem,of course, the most happy thing is to meet all of you.Come on,friends!
I’m Guangyuan Song, the team leader of JiLin-China. Now I study in TangAoqing Class whose abbreviation is “Taq”, a famous DNA polymerase. And I have two goals: I want to be a biologist in the future and taste delicious food all the world.
Hi, I'm Xiaotong Lu , a junior student majoring in biology in JLU. I love my major because I'm crazy anout any novelties and I'm firmly convinced the biosome is the most fantastic stuff in the world. Moreover, I beieve that bioresearch will finally revolutionize our life now. Let' go for it!
Hi,I am Xuerui Zeng, a sophomore in Life Sciences school, Jilin University. I like reading and experimentation, love biology and psychology, social issues and environmental protection concerns. I hope to learn more about the world.
Hi,I am Qiang Fan from Jilin University in China and I major in Biology. I have been reflecting on the true drive force of organism, properly speaking, why organisms are so harmonious. That is exactly why I love biology so much. I take life as a magic of nature. And, by the way ,I am a unprofessional foodie…Cate, Cate , Cate, I love it….
Hi, I’m Henry Xu（Peiyu Xu）, a senior student majoring pharmaceutical engineering. I love neurobiology and psychology besides my major. My dream of science is to understand the neural basis of subconsciousness in the future. It's always been my passion to be a minimalist and backpacker. I love swimming, travel, moon, dogs and silhouette photograph.
