I am Kevin Lee. My motto is ‘imagination is more important than knowledge’ by Albert Einstein. And I likethe work I did in Jilin_China team. I wish we can create a paradise for people using synthetic biology. Actually, the most important thing I learned through iGEM is using your imagination to create. We can learn from nature and use the biobricks that existed in nature. Genetic engineering will be the key star that shining around the world in the future and lead people to tomorrow. By the way, I love history, chemistry, biology, movies and music. If you want, contact me. We can be friend across country and culture.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row well" style="border-left-width:5px;border-left-color:#d9534f"><DIV class="col-lg-4 alert alert-info"><P>Hi, my name isYingdong He. I am a junior studentstudying at Jilin University. My major in 4-year study career is chemistry, especially organic chemistry. For passion to total synthesis, I do some simple and essential synthesis of catalyst. As the same as reaction can be catalyzed by kinds of catalysts, I think my life is changed by every different changes. If I have spare time, I like relaxing outside, because the smell offresh air may be betterthan my father’s foot.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row well" style="border-left-width:5px;border-left-color:#5bc0de"><DIV class="col-lg-4 alert alert-info"><P>Hi, I am Shuwen Zhang, and I am a junior student from Jilin University, majoring in biology. I have always been taking biology as a way to touch the secret of nature. And, we have come so far. From last winter to this autumn, we are here to pursue our dream of biology. A world without microcystin? YES, we are leading you to it!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row well" style="border-left-width:5px;border-left-color:#d9534f"><DIV class="col-lg-4 alert alert-info"><P>Hi, I am Zhang Endong, a junior at JLU, from South Eastof Chinaand majoring chemistry. Yeah, I am the guy who likes shopping. I had a terrific summer working with my friends at lab. I love my work in IGEM.In my spare time, I enjoy reading as well as staring blankly into the sky. We learn from the nature, and I believe we can make our life better with the bricks.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row well" style="border-left-width:5px;border-left-color:#5bc0de"><DIV class="col-lg-4 alert alert-info"><P>Hi,I am Peibo xu.They always call me Michael, from Michael Jackson, because I am a crazy fan of MJ. I also admire Jobs-- a artist who was living for changing world rather than a single merchant.  I love anything connecting with art--poem, music, film and beautiful science--biology, I believe that there is an another world in each cell---then, I have the cell, I have the world.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row well" style="border-left-width:5px;border-left-color:#d9534f"><DIV class="col-lg-4 alert alert-info"><P>Hi, I’m Yujing Wang from Beijing in China.

As a sophomore majoring in biology, I have been a crazy fun of biology for a long time. Of course, I won’t miss this great opportunity to get closer to biology. Surely, the IGEM is a competition. But for myself, I would rather to treat it as a long time chat when every member of this team try to exchange their own special ideas with each other. Although the daily work always try to bother me, I have learned a lot from this experience anyway.Thanks for my team and thanks for the IGEM.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row well" style="border-left-width:5px;border-left-color:#d9534f"><DIV class="col-lg-4 alert alert-info"><P>Hi, I’m Zhuo Wan from Jilin University.As a student of Biology,i deeply love my major and want to explore it for my lifetime.I have broad interest,such as singing , elocnte and allegro.I’m very glad to be a member of igem,of course, the most happy thing is to meet all of you.Come on,friends!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row well" style="border-left-width:5px;border-left-color:#5bc0de"><DIV class="col-lg-4 alert alert-info"><P>I’m Guangyuan Song, the team leader of JiLin-China.
