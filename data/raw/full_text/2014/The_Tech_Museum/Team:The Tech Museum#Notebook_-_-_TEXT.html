Timeline of major events:
May: Basic concept research and design
June: Software development initiated; plasmid design started and promoter-RBS’s picked
July: Wetlab testing of possible color protein combinations
August 10: Design of complete tri-color plasmids finalized
August 24: Assembly of tri-color plasmid pools completed (DNA2.0)
September 10: Tri-color plasmids optimized on museum wetlab setup
September 29: Software fully integrated with hardware on mobile exhibit
September 30 - October 3: Prototyping of mobile exhibit with museum staff and visitors
October 6 - October 17: Data collection on the museum floor with visitor!
Biology Details:

Selection of colored reporter proteins
Co-transformation testing of multiple color combinations of proteins from DNA2.0
Transformations on Kanamycin and IPTG
Final tri-color plasmid designs, assembled by DNA2.0:
Chromogenic plasmid pool
Blitzen (blue)
Kringle (yellow)
Paprika (red)
Fluorescent plasmid pool
CindyLouCFP (400/495)
KringleYFP (520/542)
PaprikaRFP (554/590)
Optimization of plasmid pools with visitor-accessible museum wetlab set up. Transformation condition:
6cm plates
400 ug/ml Amp
0.3 ul unamplified plasmid pool in 100ul CaCl2
20 ul competent bacteria
Current visitor wetlab transformation protocol: 30 sec on ice, 40 sec heat shot at 42 degrees C
Chromogenic pool maturation time ~ 5 days 37 degrees C
Fluoroescent pool maturation time ~ 3 days 37 degrees C
Low copy fluorescent plasmid pool gave more reliable results with most color variety
Safety:
We did not use any dangerous organisms or reagents. Transformation of bacteria was done in the musuem’s existing wetlab setup.
