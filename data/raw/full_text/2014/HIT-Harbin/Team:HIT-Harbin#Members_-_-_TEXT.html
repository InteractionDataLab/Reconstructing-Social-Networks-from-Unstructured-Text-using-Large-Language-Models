HITGEM-TEAM
Team 2014 HITGEM is composed of 20 young members at Harbin Institute of Technology. Formed on October 2013, this team has created the device Detective Y. A group of greenhands as we are, we cherish each mistake we've made, enjoy every moment we've spent together, and deeply appreciate every friend who has ever helped us!
Team Members
Wu Yifan
She is the leader of the team and played an important role in purposing the idea this year. Meanwhile, she did some chores to help the designers of molecular experimental work. It is very pleasant to work with her since she can always bring energy to her mates. Maybe that is what a leader should be.
Wu Xianfan
He played an important part in the team image. As the designer of the logo, T-shirt and poster in the team, he has burned a lot of midnight oil this summer. He magically turned our logo, poster, presentation, team shirt into fantastic arts.
Li Jing
She is one of core members of the group and the team. She played an important role in most of our experiment together with Liu Dong. She devoted herself to ascertain the main part of our project. We can tell from the notebook that she is an optimistic fighter who can always find a way out of the failed experiments.
Li Ye
Ye Li, from the School of Computer Science, is a member of our software group. He did most of the construction of HITGEM public platform based on a prevalent app called Wechat. Thanks for his engagement, we can chat and even have fun with the AI on our mobile.
Liang Zhiying
As a sophomore Food Science student, Liang is a hard working boy with an optimistic attitude toward life. In the team of  wetlab, he took part in the parts' construction. He seems to be a little bit shy though, chances are that he was the one  who comes out with intelligent ideas.
Yang Yuming
She is a positive buffer of the relationship in our team. She also contributed a lot in the lab, helping Jing and Dong accelerate our progress of experiment. Besides the experiments, browsing online and tweeting aroud are another works she did everyday. FYI, she is a pretty girl. Well, as least, she tries to be.
Yao Zhiyuan
Yao Zhiyuan is a freshman from Honors School. Mastering limited knowledge about biology, he quickly catched up with our design.  He helped the teams in a wide array of aspects, including the design of wiki, interpretation, and the presentation.  He is also an activator of brainstorming. Besides, his outrageous high GPA is absolutely an positive energy for the whole team...
Liu YE
Liu Ye, from the School of Food Science and Engineering. is one of the core members of the wiki group. He is charge of both foreground and background of WIKI’s service as well as the modification and upgrade. He worked day and night to guarantee the normal operation and the format of WIKI. Busy but industrious.
Fan Xi
Xi Fan, from Honors School, majoring in Energy and Power, is a member of wetlab team at HITGEM. It is her first year engaging in iGEM. But she kept learning synthetic biology and tried to search for relevent resources.  She will play an important role in next year's competition.
Ren Kuan
Ren Kuan, a sophomore at the school of life sicence and technology, is a member in our wet lab. He made a great amount of  contribution for idea discussion, as well as for the experiments in the lab. For times, he gave us some advise about how to  live a better life in our campus.
You Yong
You Yong is also in his first year at HITGEM. Young as he is, he played an important role in discussion and taught our group members about some fundamental programming languages. We can never deny his efforts in broadening our perspectives.
Zhang Xiaoting
Zhang Xiaoting, from School of Life Science and Technology, also works in our wet lab. She does not talk a lot, but devote herself whenever she is in the lab. She was delighted since she strengthened her experiment skills and learned a lot from the lab. She also made many friends.
Li Mingda
Li Mingda, as the manager of the software team, is responsible for the development and the design of the software.In the process, he learned much about the biologic and gave many good ideas for the team. At the same time, he worked very hard as the leader of software team. He and his partener completed their work fast and completely.
Liu Dong
He is Liu Dong, in the wet lab. He contributed a lot in designing primes, PCR expriments and some experiments about yeast.  Reading novels as well as meditation is his favourites, especially for the philosophical problems.  His faith is that our life span is limited, so we should enjoy it.
Liu Teren
HE is TE REN.
