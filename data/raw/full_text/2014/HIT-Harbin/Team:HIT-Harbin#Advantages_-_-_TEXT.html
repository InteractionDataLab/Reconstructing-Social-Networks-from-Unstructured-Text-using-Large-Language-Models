The advantage of Green Yeast
１．Safer
Yeast is in the biosafety group 1,which means it is harmless.Which has been a good friends and important food starter culture for human since ancient time. At least 4,000 years ago, ancient Egyptians used yeast to make bread. Archaeologists exploring Egyptian heritage sites found early grinding stones and baking chambers for making bread, as well as drawings of 4,000-year-old bakeries and breweries. It is totally safe for us, much more, the sequence we used to transform into the cell are also safe sequences including LexA DBD binding sequences of bacteria/mouse dioxin receptor protein and fluorescent protein coding genes and now we only use them for Lab experiments.
2.  Cheaper
Green Yeast cost little to be compared with the dioxin detective method on the market.Both the HRGC-HRMS and CLAUX method cost a lot. Now in China you have to cost 1,000 CYN per time for dioxin detective. Once we get the stable engineering green yeast cell. We can grow the yeast in SD medium or YPD medium, both of them are cheap. What we have to do is only to control the conditions of the bioreactor. So that this is also the advantage of the the microbiological industry.
3. Nearer
Both the HRGC-HRMS and CLAUX needs a high level of instrument.which can’t product industrial productions. But green yeast are different. We can dry out the yeast into powder and put it in your pocket. Imagine that when you go hiking in a forest, you can bring out the Green Yeast and to test the whether the water is polluted or not. Or when you put the fresh eggs into freezer, you can also add some Green Yeast in it to see whether the food is safe or not.
4.  wider
The yeast is the only eukaryotic cell which can be transformed by plasmids. That means our Green yeast has a good ability to be improved. Also the yeast genome is opposite small. For example we have done the modeling for the expression of biosurfactant and we also got a good result.It seems that our project has a bright future.
