HITGEM-TEAM
Team 2014 HITGEM is composed of 20 young members at Harbin Institute of Technology. Formed on October 2013, this team has created the device Detective Y. A group of greenhands as we are, we cherish each mistake we've made, enjoy every moment we've spent together, and deeply appreciate every friend who has ever helped us!
ADVISORS
Xu Dechang
He is our super advisor of the team. He provided us with firmly technical support about our experiment design. It is he who always couraged and helped us to overcome most of obstacles we've met in project. Without his professional knowledge and highly experimental skills about iPS, the experiments we did in mouse iPS and human iPS would be nothing but impossible. He made our idea more clear and beautiful.
Mario
He is a young professor in Stem Cell and Functional Genomics Laboratory in Sun Yat-sen University. He offered us with most of the experimental spaces, equipment and materials. He also gave us a lot suggestions on our idea. Thank him for standing with his office in a total mess for such a long time because of us.
