1.1 Software Overview
IGEMHelper is a mobile application based on android4.0.3 and operation systems of higher level, with the website http://hitigem.jd-app.com as its background of data management.
All data downloaded or uploaded through this application could be showed and managed on this background.
Our APP is aimed at providing a platform of “helping trading” among IGEM teams. Users can offer their help through the APP to the team who post their demand. The process may enhance the communication among the IGEM teams and maximize resources shared by teams.
1.2 Instruction of Software using
Tip: Since the database will be updated every time the APP starts running, keeping the Internet connection available is necessary. (Operation system must be android 4.0.3 or versions of higher level)
1.2.1 Download the APK file from GOOGLE DRIVE
Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_oCai3w7FmDUWVYYU9USUJ2SE0/view?usp=sharing
1.2.2 Run the APK to install the APP
1.2.3 After the installation, click the icon of IGEMHelper to enter the APP.
1.2.4 The application will update automatically basing on the background database and then turn into the main interface.
1.2.5 As the interface shows，our APP provide four types of help information, which are Material, Theory, Software and Others.
Now we take “Material” for instance. Click the column of Material, and all kinds of help information will be presented.
1.2.6 Click the title of the help information in order to check the detail.
Now we take “TestTube” for instance.
1.2.7 The help information will be presented in the form of dialog box, including the title, pictures, quantity demanded and a blank box where users can type their quantity available to help.
Now we take 100 TestTube for instance.
Click “ADD”.
1.2.8 If users want to have a second consideration，they may click the column of TestTube to delete it.
Click “submit”, which requires some of your information for convenience of later connection.
Confirm your information and click “submit”, then wait for connection from our administrators.  Determine whether the help is effective. If positive, we will provide the information to the help seeker, and delete the help information. Before we ensure that the help is effective, we won’t delete the help information.
1.2.9 Users can report their confusion back to us by the “Feedback”. Those feedbacks will be submitted to the website background.
