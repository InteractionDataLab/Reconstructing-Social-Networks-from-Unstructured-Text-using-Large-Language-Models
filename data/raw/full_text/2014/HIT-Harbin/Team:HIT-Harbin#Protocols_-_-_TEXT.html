FD EcoRⅠ、FD Spe Ⅰ
FD SpeⅠ、FD Pst Ⅰ
FD EcoR Ⅰ、FD Xba Ⅰ
The enzymes using in the experiments are all from Thermo company.
5. Ligation system  reaction
1)Prepare the following reaction system:
2)Incubate it more than 1 hour at 22 ℃ water bath
6. PCR reaction
1)Prepare the following reaction system:
2)The PCR reaction setting:
7. Agarose Electrophoresis
1)Prepare a piece of 1% weight-to-volume agarose and add SYBR dye or  ethidium bromide
2)Place the agarose in the apparatus rig with the wells facing the  negative electrode (black-colored)
3)Fill the rig with 1x TAE buffer
4)Load 5 uL 1 kb marker
5)Add 1 uL of 6x buffer to 5 uL DNA sample. Load the mixture
6)Run at 120V
8. Purification of DNA
1)Cut out the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a razor blade,  while minimizing the size of the gel slice
2)Weigh the gel slice and add 3 volumes of gel lysis buffer to every  1 volume of gel(100mg = 100 uL)
3)Wait 2 minutes
4)Centrifuge it at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute
5)Discard the flow-through and repeat Step 4 until all sample has  passed through the column
6)Add 700 uL rinse buffer into the column, then centrifuge it at  12,000 rpm for 1 minute
7)Discard the flow-through and add 500 uL rinse buffer into the  column, then centrifuge it at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute
8)Discard the flow-through and centrifuge the column at 12,000 for 2  minutes
9)Transfer the column to a new centrifuge tube. Open the tube at 37℃ for a few  minutes to volatilize the alcohol
10)Add 40 uL elution buffer to the center of the column and wait at  least 2 minutes
11)Centrifuge it at 12,000 rpm for 1 minutes

C. Integration od a linearized plasmid into the yeast genome
 
 
Material:
o       DNA  mix: 20ul of solution containing a linearized plasmid;
o       LiAc  mix, Salmon Sperm DNA, and PEG mix;
o       DMSO,  YPD solution, and agar plates (SD-URA or SD-TRP);
o       Cuvettes  (OD measurement) and sterile beads (cell plating).
Method  (ALWAYS STERILE CONDITIONS):
1st day:
-        grow  yeast cells overnight into YPD
2nd day:
-        Fast  method:
       Measure  cell culture OD;
       If  OD > 10 pour 500ul cell solution into 20ml YPD. Use glass flasks with  baffles.
       Grow  cells at 30 Celsius degrees and 130 RPM for 5-6 hours.
-        Pour  the 20 ml cell solution into one 50 ml Greiner tube.
-        Centrifuge  at max 1000 RCF for 5 minutes at room temperature.
-        Throw  away the supernatant.
-        Resuspend  with 5 ml of sterile water by inverting the tube gently.
-        Centrifuge  at 3000 RCF for 5 min at room temperature.
-        Throw  away the supernatant.
-        Resuspend  with 200 ml of LiAc mix.
-        Transfer  100 ul of cells solution into the 1.5 ml eppendorf containing the 20ul DNA mix.
-        Add  10 l of Salmon Sperm DNA—some salmon sperm DNA might require to be boiled at  95 Celsius degree (only the salmon sperm DNA) for 5 min every third time you  use it. Let it cool down at room temperature.
-        Add  600 l of PEG mix.
-        Put  the plates into the incubator at 30 Celsius degrees.
-        Incubate  the 1.5 ml eppendorf on the wheel for 30 min at low speed ~0.1.
-        Add  73 ul DMSO.
-        Make  a heat shock by incubating the eppendorf on a small shaker for 15 minute at 42  Celsius degrees and high speed (1250 RPM).
-        Centrifuge  at max 0.8 RCF at room temperature for 2 min.
-        Suck  off the supernatant with a pipette.
-        Resuspend  with 300 ul YPD. Mix the solution with a pipette.
-        Incubate  for 20 min on the wheel (at low speed again).
-        Depose  300 ul on the corresponding plate.
-        Spread  the cell solution on the plate with sterile beads.
-        Incubate  for 2 nights in the incubator at 30 Celsius degrees.
