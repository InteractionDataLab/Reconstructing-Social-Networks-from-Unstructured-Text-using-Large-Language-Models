This software generates models for circuit components such as Standard Biological Parts and Pools of molecules (proteins, mRNA, chemicals, etc.). Complex Parts such as our regulated promoters needs many species and reactions to be described properly. Parts &amp; Pools provides such a detailed Part representation via a “rule-based modeling” approach. Parts &amp; Pools generates, indeed, a set of rules and passes to the software BioNetGen [5] that returns a complete list of species and reaction inside the Part. Parts &amp; Pools converts this information into an MDL (Model Definition Language) [6] file. In this format, Parts and Pools are independent modules that can be wired up together into a circuit. We designed our circuits with the software ProMoT [7]. Finally, we exported out circuit, from the MDL to the SBML format [8] and simulated them with COPASI [9].       </P></DIV></DIV></H4><H4>1.	Main ideas</H4><P>Synthetic gene circuits are designed as the electronic ones. We used Standard Biological Parts such as promoters, coding regions, and terminators that have a well-defined function in transcription or translation. Together with Parts, we used Pools as stores for different kind of molecules.</P><P>Parts and Pools exchange fluxes of molecules like electric components exchange a flux of electrons (current). Biological currents are, for instance, (PoPS: Polymerases Per Second) and (RiPS: Ribosomes Per Second). RNA polymerases, indeed, scan entire DNA transcription units and  ribosomes go through all the Parts on the mRNA.</P><P>Our synthetic activators are also stored into a Pool. Their flux (Factor Per Second) puts in communication the two transcription units in our circuits. Finally, the dioxin (chemical) Pool is an interface between the circuit and the cell environment. The nucleus has also a Pool for the spliceosome and RNA polymerase, whereas the cytoplasm contains as many mRNA pools as there are coding regions in the circuit, a Pool for the ribosome, and one for the fluorescent protein, the circuit read-out.  Each Part (and each Pool) has an independent model (MDL file). After wiring them together, the model of the whole circuit comes from the composition of the models of all its components. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="multi-columns"><DIV class="paragraphs"><H4>2.	Building the model</H4><P>As mentioned above, we used four different kinds of software: Parts &amp; Pools, BioNetGen, ProMoT, and Copasi.</P><P>Every Part has its own input file. A promoter input file requires specifying the promoter structure (operator number) and the kind of regulation transcription regulation, if present. Since every operator can lie in two states (free, or taken by a transcription factor), a promoter with N operators can lie into at least 2^N states (combinatorial explosion). Indeed, the promoters we used in our circuits with simple activation host 4 operators, each bound by the same activator. Overall, these promoters host 36 species and 174 reactions. More complex is the promoter we used in the memory circuit. It has 6 operators: 3 bound by the simple LexA-DR (Dioxin Receptor) activator, and the other 3 by the fusion protein GFP-LexA-DR (we could not model operators shared by the two activators but this design is totally equivalent). The model of this promoter shows, on the whole, 133 species and 958 reactions. Such a complex description can be achieved with a rules-based modeling approach. Parts &amp; Pools converts, therefore, an input file into a list of rules that are sent to BioNetGen. BioNetGen returns a list of species and reactions to Parts &amp; Pools. Parts &amp; Pools adds to this the only information missing to have a model for the promoter as an independent Part: the fluxes of molecules it exchanges with other Parts and Pools in a circuit. This final description (species, reaction, and fluxes of molecules) is written into an MDL file. These files are generated for each circuit components. They are loaded into ProMoT, the software we used for our circuit visual design. ProMoT generates the model for the complete circuits and permits to export it into SBML format for running circuit simulations. We simulated the dynamics of our circuits with COPASI (see the Figure above).  </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="multi-columns"><DIV class="paragraphs" style="border-bottom: 2px solid #04979D;"><H4>Results</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV style="width: 450px; margin: 0 auto;"><H6>Sensor group without dioxin</H6></DIV><DIV style="width: 450px; margin: 0 auto;"><H6>Sensor group with dioxin c=0.001mol/L</H6></DIV><DIV style="width: 450px; margin: 0 auto;"><H6>Control group without dioxin.</H6></DIV><DIV class="multi-columns"><DIV class="paragraphs"><P>We spent a whole day to design and simulate related devices with this software and ProMoT.

</P><H5>1) The influence from the time of synthesis of mRNA</H5>
Suppose the concentration of mRNA is cmr, the synthesis rate is s, and the half life of mRNA is T.
Then we have:


Solving the differential equation, we can obtain the result:
<P>According to the statistics from bionumbers, mRNA’s half life is around 2mins, while its synthesis time is less than 5s. There’s no harm to assume that mRNA’s synthesis rate is 0.01mol/s. By computing with C program, we can observe that after 9s, the corresponding change of concentration of mRNA is less than 0.1%. Comparing with the synthesis time for protein which is more than 3mins, it is less than 10%. So basically, the concentration of mRNA during the phase of synthesis of protein is fixed and it satisfies:

, which is cmr=sT/ln2
</P><H5>2) The influence from the time of synthesis of regulatory factors GFP/LexA</H5><P>In accordance with the result of search, the half life of GFP/LexA is around one hour, while synthesis takes about 2mins. By using qtiplot, we can see the whole process with C programing.
