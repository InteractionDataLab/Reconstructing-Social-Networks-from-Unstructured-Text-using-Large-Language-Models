					HITGEM-TEAM
				</H2></HEADER></DIV><DIV class="team_content"><DIV id="overview"><P>
				Team 2014 HITGEM is composed of 20 young members at Harbin Institute of Technology. Formed on October 2013, this team has created the device Detective Y. A group of greenhands as we are, we cherish each mistake we've made, enjoy every moment we've spent together, and deeply appreciate every friend who has ever helped us!

He is powerful in computer.We had lots of meets together,and shared many interesting ideas.</P></DIV><DIV id="dch" class="teacher"><H3>Dai Cuihong</H3><P>She is the lecturer for the experiment section of our course &quot;Simulation, Design and Implementation of Biologic Circuits based on BioBricks&quot;. Her patience and kindness comforts us all the time. She gives our instructions about experiments of synthetic biology and is in charge of the purchase of materials.</P></DIV><DIV id="cdy" class="teacher"><H3>Chen Dayou</H3><P>He is a professor in the School of Food Science and Engineering. As an expert in the field of genome of sugar beet, he offers theoretical instruction to us.
</P></DIV><DIV id="haj" class="teacher"><H3>Hou Aiju</H3><P>She is also a professor in the School of Food Science and Engineering. With her rich experience in the wet lab, she imparted us a lot of tips and experimental instruction.</P></DIV></DIV><H1 id="TT">Team Members</H1><DIV id="Members"><DIV class="r_frame" id="YIFAN"><H1>Wu Yifan</H1><P>
				She is the leader of the team and played an important role in purposing the idea this year. Meanwhile, she did some chores to help the designers of molecular experimental work. It is very pleasant to work with her since she can always bring energy to her mates. Maybe that is what a leader should be.
				</P></DIV><DIV class="l_frame" id="XIANFAN"><H1>Wu Xianfan</H1><P>
He played an important part in the team image. As the designer of the logo, T-shirt and poster in the team, he has burned a lot of midnight oil this summer. He magically turned our logo, poster, presentation, team shirt into fantastic arts.
		</P></DIV><DIV class="r_frame" id="LIJING"><H1>Li Jing</H1><P>
She is one of core members of the group and the team. She played an important role in most of our experiment together with Liu Dong. She devoted herself to ascertain the main part of our project. We can tell from the notebook that she is an optimistic fighter who can always find a way out of the failed experiments.
		</P></DIV><DIV class="l_frame" id="LIYE"><H1>Li Ye</H1><P>
Ye Li, from the School of Computer Science, is a member of our software group. He did most of the construction of HITGEM public platform based on a prevalent app called Wechat. Thanks for his engagement, we can chat and even have fun with the AI on our mobile.
		</P></DIV><DIV class="r_frame" id="ZHIYING"><H1>Liang Zhiying</H1><P>
As a sophomore Food Science student, Liang is a hard working boy with an optimistic attitude toward life. In the team of 
wetlab, he took part in the parts' construction. He seems to be a little bit shy though, chances are that he was the one 
who comes out with intelligent ideas. 
		</P></DIV><DIV class="l_frame" id="YUMING"><H1>Yang Yuming</H1><P>
She is a positive buffer of the relationship in our team. She also contributed a lot in the lab, helping Jing and Dong accelerate our progress of experiment. Besides the experiments, browsing online and tweeting aroud are another works she did everyday. FYI, she is a pretty girl. Well, as least, she tries to be.
		</P></DIV><DIV class="r_frame" id="ZHIYUAN"><H1>Yao Zhiyuan</H1><P>
Yao Zhiyuan is a freshman from Honors School. Mastering limited knowledge about biology, he quickly catched up with our design. 
He helped the teams in a wide array of aspects, including the design of wiki, interpretation, and the presentation. 
He is also an activator of brainstorming. Besides, his outrageous high GPA is absolutely an positive energy for the whole team...
		</P></DIV><DIV class="l_frame" id="LIUYE"><H1>Liu YE</H1><P>
Liu Ye, from the School of Food Science and Engineering. is one of the core members of the wiki group. He is charge of both foreground and background of WIKI’s service as well as the modification and upgrade. He worked day and night to guarantee the normal operation and the format of WIKI. Busy but industrious.
		</P></DIV><DIV class="r_frame" id="FANXI"><H1>Fan Xi</H1><P>
Xi Fan, from Honors School, majoring in Energy and Power, is a member of wetlab team at HITGEM.
It is her first year engaging in iGEM. But she kept learning synthetic biology and tried to search for relevent resources. 
She will play an important role in next year's competition.
		</P></DIV><DIV class="l_frame" id="RENKUAN"><H1>Ren Kuan</H1><P>
Ren Kuan, a sophomore at the school of life sicence and technology, is a member in our wet lab. He made a great amount of 
contribution for idea discussion, as well as for the experiments in the lab. For times, he gave us some advise about how to 
live a better life in our campus.
		</P></DIV><DIV class="r_frame" id="YOUYONG"><H1>You Yong</H1><P>
You Yong is also in his first year at HITGEM. Young as he is, he played an important role in discussion and taught our group members about some fundamental programming languages. We can never deny his efforts in broadening our perspectives.
		</P></DIV><DIV class="l_frame" id="XIAOTING"><H1>Zhang Xiaoting</H1><P>
Zhang Xiaoting, from School of Life Science and Technology, also works in our wet lab. She does not talk a lot, but devote herself whenever she is in the lab. She was delighted since she strengthened her experiment skills and learned a lot from the lab. She also made many friends.

                </P></DIV><DIV class="r_frame" id="MINGDA"><H1>Li Mingda</H1><P>
Li Mingda, as the manager of the software team, is responsible for the development and the design of the software.In the process, he learned much about the biologic and gave many good ideas for the team. At the same time, he worked very hard as the leader of software team. He and his partener completed their work fast and completely. 


                </P></DIV><DIV class="l_frame" id="LIUDONG"><H1>Liu Dong</H1><P>
He is Liu Dong, in the wet lab. He contributed a lot in designing primes, PCR expriments and some experiments about yeast.
 Reading novels as well as meditation is his favourites, especially for the philosophical problems. 
His faith is that our life span is limited, so we should enjoy it.

                </P></DIV><DIV class="r_frame" id="TEREN"><H1>Liu Teren</H1><P>
HE is TE REN, from the School of Materials. Being born on August 1997 makes him the youngest in the team! Different age makes me unique in the team, as I'm always the guy who  love to think different or even impossible. He is the person who is resposible for
 modelling work. To join the HIT-iGEM team he gained a lot, such as friendship, knowledge and happiness.
