BBa_K1539001
Part
Coding sequence has a high efficiency promoter followed by a high efficiency RBS to express fluorescent protein mCherry.
814 bp
BBa_K1539002
Part
Coding sequence has a low efficiency promoter followed by a low efficiency RBS to express fluorescent protein mCherry.
814 bp
BBa_K1539003
Part
This coding sequence is for the beta subunit for Protein A (composed of three subunits) of the multi-complex enzyme soluble methane monooxyegnase (sMMO). The gene has been codon optimized for E. coli.
1170 bp
BBa_K1539005
Part
This coding sequence is for the gamma subunit for Protein A (composed of three subunits) of the multi-complex enzyme soluble methane monooxyegnase (sMMO). The gene has been codon optimized for E. coli.
513 bp
BBa_K1539008
Part
This coding sequence is for the gene sMMO B, encoding Protein B of the multi-complex enzyme soluble methane monooxyegnase (sMMO). The gene has been codon optimized for E. coli.
426 bp
BBa_K1539013
Part
This coding sequence is for the gene sMMO C, encoding Protein C of the multi-complex enzyme soluble methane monooxyegnase (sMMO). The gene has been codon optimized for E. coli.
1047 bp
BBa_K1539021
Device
This primer is used to insert a high efficiency RBS to transcribe genes starting with ATG in E. coli.
46 bp
BBa_K1539034
Device
This primer is used to insert a low efficiency RBS to transcribe genes starting with ATG in E. coli.
46 bp
BBa_K1539055
Device
This primer is used to insert a high efficiency promoter to translate E. coli. genes. Must be used after insertion of RBS primer. Use Georgia Tech iGEM RBS primers (BBa_K1539021 or BBa_K1539034) or an RBS primer with a similar design.
58 bp
BBa_K1539089
Device
This primer is used to insert a low efficiency promoter to translate E. coli. genes. Must be used after insertion of RBS primer. Use Georgia Tech iGEM RBS primers (BBa_K1539021 or BBa_K1539034) or an RBS primer with a similar design.
