In this section we would like to recognize and give thanks to the people and organizations that have made our research this year possible.
We would first like to recognize our faculty advisors, Dr. Thomas Barker, Dr. Mark Styczynski, and Dr. Eric Gaucher. Professor Barker provided us with the greatest gift of laboratory space, as well as assistance in securing funding and other laboratory resources for our research. In addition, Dr. Barker, Dr. Stycynski, and Dr. Gaucher gave us insight and feedback during the formulation and design of our research goals, and continued to make themselves available for such feedback throughout the iGEM timeline. They have also contributed by maintaining the legacy of iGEM at Georgia Tech, ensuring the continued success and growth of the program among the undergraduate students from one year to the next.
In addition to our faculty advisors, we would also like to recognise our graduate student advisers Dwight Chambers and Haylee Bachman who have been invaluable to us in improving our lab performance and planning the steps to creating and characterizing our parts and devices. From the very first day, they provided us with laboratory training and feedback on our designs, and in the lab they were our resources for mastering new protocols and maintaining organization within our team.
Lastly we would like to give thanks to our corporate and collegiate sponsors. Our corporate sponsors including Geneious, Genscript, IDT, and Macrogen have provided us with the tools, reagents, and funds to pursue our research. Beyond this we would like to thank the College of Engineering and the school of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia Tech for the travel funds used to send our team to this year's Giant Jamboree.
Thank You!
