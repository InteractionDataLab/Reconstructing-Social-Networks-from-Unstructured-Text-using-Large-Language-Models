Understanding that our organism could create potentially harmful methanol and other hydrocarbons during methane remediation, it is envisioned that the bacteria will eventually be engineered with a kill-switch to prevent it's escape from industrial remediation of methane.
</P><H2>Laboratory Safety</H2><P> Our project involves regular use of safe blue lights to visualize DNA bands after gel electrophoresis. Antibiotics used in the lab to selectively grow bacteria may be toxic to humans in large doses, and a Bunsen burner may be used on the bench to maintain a sterile environment or to sterilize some metal equipment during procedures involving bacteria.</P><H2>Chassis Organisms</H2><TABLE rules="all" style="text-align:center; border:1px solid #C0C0C0;"><TBODY><TR><TH width="20%">Species</TH><TH width="20%">Strain</TH><TH width="20%">Risk Group</TH><TH width="40%">Disease Risk to Humans</TH></TR><TR><TD><I>Escherichia coli</I></TD><TD>DH5α (K-12 Derivative), BL21-A1</TD><TD>1</TD><TD>non-pathogenic, non-colonizing strains, although they may cause irritation to the skin, eyes, lungs, and kidneys.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Our team works with E. coli DH5α and BL21 on a daily basis as a tool to selectively grow plasmids and express recombinant proteins respectively. Both of these strains are Biosafety level 1 organisms and can be handled safely in our existing lab space, however precautions are still undertaken to limit user exposure and the release of bacteria and recombinant DNA in the lab.</P><H2>Recombinant Coding DNA</H2><P>Our recombinant DNA does not pose a threat to any humans, however it may cause environmental harm if genes for antibiotic resistance or increased gene expression escaped from the lab. Precautions are therefore undertaken to ensure that our recombinant DNA does not leave the lab space.</P><H3 id="Lab">Our Lab</H3><P>Our lab space is equipped with all of the essentials to genetically engineer our bacteria, centrifuges, thermo-cyclers, micropipettes (with a hand carved pipette rack), and a host of loving grad students. Although many other iGEM teams around the world have obtained an entire room for their work, we are quite cozy with our own lab bench and rented &quot;think space&quot;(note: insert hover picture of PBL room). Past Georgia Tech iGEM teams have done right by us and collected a large selection of hand-me-down lab tools (from pipettes to incubators) as well as having saved up the money to purchase a Qiacube to automatically perform almost any DNA, RNA, or Protein purification offered by Qiagen. Beyond this, our team also has access to many of the other tools shared by other labs in the building, including Gel-docs, cold rooms for slow growth of bacteria, flow cytometers, and much much more.</P><H3 id="Protocol">Safety Protocol</H3><P>All members of our lab are required to wear close-toed shoes, long pants, and nitrile gloves when working in the lab, as well as goggles when working with volatile chemicals or UV light. Team members are required to receive proper instruction from either a graduate student or experienced team member when using a new instrument or technique, and may not perform lab work unless at least one graduate supervisor is present in the lab also. </P><P>Our lab avoids use of carcinogenic substances wherever possible, although if one must be used, then it must be done in a taped off area of the lab and properly cleaned both before and after use. Fume hoods are available for use when working with volatile chemicals, as well as a fire cabinet for proper storage of such chemicals.</P><P>All disposable lab materials that come into contact with biological lab specimens such as pipette tips, petri dishes, gloves, and other objects are placed in biohazard bags for proper disposal. All sharps and glass containers are also similar disposed of in appropriate sharps collection boxes. All reusable glass ware is autoclaved before washing if it has been in contact with live cultures and all tools and bench spaces are cleaned with ethanol or bleach after use with recombinant DNA or live cultures respectively. It is not expected that any hazardous chemicals or biological samples will be used in the lab this year, although EHS has implemented proper disposal methods for such materials.</P><P>Additionally, as required by Georgia Tech EHS, two copies of all MSDS sheets for chemicals stored or used in the lab were maintained, one for our reference and another for the lab manager. There are also mandated fire extinguishers, safety showers, eyewashes, and clearly marked emergency exits.</P><P>Lastly, all team members are required to undergo EHS training in general biosafety and complete a right-to-know training module before being allowed to perform any lab work. These two sessions covered proper use, handling, and storage of hazardous substances as well as the labeling of such substances, emergency procedures, and general lab policies maintained at Georgia Tech. Although not necessary, most of the team also received training for handling blood and tissue samples and information on blood borne pathogens as part of a recommended training session.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
