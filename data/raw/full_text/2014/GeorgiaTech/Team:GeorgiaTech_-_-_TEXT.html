How does dissolved methane from fracking endanger our water?
Look at this running stream and imagine how it would appear when contaminated with methane gas. If you pictured it as a flowing stream of seltzer water, then you're not far off.
The demand for natural gas to fuel growing industries has led to the development and increased use of fracking techniques to extract methane and other natural gases from shale veins deep in the Earth's crust. In the extraction process, up to several million gallons of fracking fluid are pumped into the well, all of which must be later treated for methane and other hydrocarbon contaminants.
Our project aims to enable E. coli to produce soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) a protein capable of converting methane into less volatile methanol, which can then be treated by further remediation pathways or extracted for commercial use.
How can synthetic biology eliminate the methane threat?

Our lab is equipped with the tools to synthesize new genetic sequences and generate transgenic bacteria capable of taking methane out of the water, one bubble at a time.
