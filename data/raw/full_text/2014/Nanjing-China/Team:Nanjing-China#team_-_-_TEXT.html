INSTRUCTORS
CONTRIBUTION
Miao Runfeng
She is the leader of the team.             She arranged the team work and organized the team to obtain knowledge on Synthetic biology.             She is the designer of our timer section and biosafety section. She also took part in the gene circuits’             construction work and verified some parts’ function.
Wu Yue
He is the deputy leader of the team.             He is in charge of the modeling section and worked out most of the models.             He is also the designer of the detection section and did the data analysis work for the team.             In addition, he uploaded most of the information of the parts we submitted.
Zhang Xin
She is the other deputy leader of the team.             She is in charge of the work related to MlrD and did the cooperation work with Jilin_China.             She also takes part in the gene circuit' construction work and constructed plenty of parts for the team.
Fu Lu
She mainly takes part in the wet lab work,             which include not only the gene circuits’ construction work, but also the functional verification work.             What is more, she also helped with the work related to the gold ions.
Li Peiqi
She takes part in the work related to MlrD and did all the HPLC work.             She constructed some parts for the team and helped with the information gathering work.             She is also in charge of our Human Practice and figured out great ideas.
Ji Yilun
He is an intelligent guy and can always help us out when we are in trouble.             He is also one of the designers of our positive feedback section and did plenty of work on the gene circuits’ construction.             He is also in charge of the functional verification of our system.
Wang Chuxi
She is in charge of our wiki and poster. She is good at Photoshop and is talented in design.             She worked out all the design drawings of our projects.             She also took part in the iGEM seminar held by NCTU on behave of our team and contributed to some of the lab work.
Wang Ye
She is one of the designers of our disposing section.             She is a talented guy who solved plenty of troubles we met in the experiment.             What is more, she did plenty of work on the gene circuits’ construction and submitted some parts for the team.
Xiao Shuke
He was a member of 2013-Nanjing-China.             He gave us a lot of advice and shared the experience of last year with us.             He is familiar with the protocols and did great contribution to our lab work. He also did the sequence design work of gene mrlD.
Xie Xiaoman
She is in charge of the design of sensors.             She is major in bioinformatics, so she did the design work of the MC riboswitches,             and selected the most optimal ones for our project. She also did some Human Practice work and gave presentation in the seminar held by NCTU.
Xue Qiaochu
She handles the finance for us and did most of the communication work for the team.             She is also a member of the Human Practice group and found great ideas.             In addition, she did the preparation work for our experiments and also helped with our wiki.
Yang Shaozhong
He is one of the designers of our disposing section.             He found the lab for us to do experiments and played important role in information gathering work.             What is more, he also did plenty of wet lab work which related to the gene circuits’ construction and helped with the submission work.
Pan Shuyu
She is a guy major in mathematics.             She showed great interest in synthetic biology and attend us to work on the project.             She went to Tsinghua with Wu Yue to study modeling and helped Wu Yue with the modeling work.
Sun Peiqing
He is the advisor of our team. He is in charge of the work related to the gold ions.             He also helped us to learn the protocols used in our project and designed some of the primers for us.             What is more, he gave us useful advice when we met difficulties in the experiments.
Wei Wei
Research assistant
Research: Surface display of metalloproteins for metal ion adsorption and environmental remediation.
Zhao Jing
Professor
Research: Cell-based sensors and fluorescent probes for metals, gasotransmitters, and small RNA.
