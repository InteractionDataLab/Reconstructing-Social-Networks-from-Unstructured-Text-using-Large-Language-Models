Here we express our gratitude to technical support from Prof. Zhao Jing’s lab, Nanjing University.         We express our gratitude to the great support from Professor Kong Lingdong and Professor Yang Sihai, and the help from
other teachers from the School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University.         And especially, we express our heartfelt thanks to:         2014-Tsinghua-A, for their help in our model building.         2014-Jilin-China, for their help with the mrlA gene synthesis.         2014-NCTU_Formosa, for their great seminar.         Wang Jiangning, for his help in buliding the wiki.         Finally, we express great thanks to 2014-NJU-QIBEBT and 2013-Nanjing-China for providing us with some important substance,
How to make use of our bacteria?
    To solve this problem, we constructed a small device like this:
a normal injector with a filtering membrane front. We will culture our bacteria on the filtering         membrane anteriorly. When
used, you just need to take in some dirty water and eject them,         then you will get clean water.
Moreover, we try to design a device to clean the water discharge from factories.
As is shown in the picture, if we fix the channel 1 in the end of factories’ tube,         after a while, open the channel 3, clean water
will pour out.
How to avoid engineered bacteria hazard and gene transfer?
     Our plasmid consists more than 40 artificial fragments. To avoid hazard caused by engineered bacteria,         we construct a suicide system. Bacteria with the "suicide system" will perform like this:
In our lab, we will use IPTG to culture bacteria, and in the nature, bacteria will die without IPTG or Toxin.We proved that it works in our wet lab experiments.We also design some systems to stop horizontal gene transfer. Detail can be seen in our safety section.
How can we popularize iGEM and make people from deferent fields know synthetic biology?
     We establish iGEM club and have finished the new recruit. In the new recruit we attract many students from deferent departments who are interested in synthetic biology. In addition, we are planning to establish an information platform that students from all departments of Nanjing University can share the information related to iGEM. These activities are all supported by teachers of our university.         Here are some pictures in the new recruit.
In addition, we also apply for a reward about environment that our university hold.
