Cellulose Acetate
We produced a moldable & 3D printable bioplastic by transferring the acetylation machinery from Pseudomonas fluorescens into Acetobacter hansenii.
Amberless Hell Cell
We generated hearty, radiation, heat, & cold resistant bacteria that are incapable of transferring engineered genes into the environment.
Material Waterproofing
Our team biomimetically produced waxes and novel wasp proteins that prevent water absorbance without being toxic to the surrounding ecosystem.
Biodegradability
Though cellulose acetate is an inherently biodegradable material, our team decided to undertake the active degradation of the biomaterial to streamline the process.
Human Practices
We conducted a series of interviews with UAV experts, scientists, and civilians at large to discover the many beneficial uses of UAVs and synthetic biology.
We are currently working on a series of projects towards the construction of a fully biological unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for use in scientific and humanitarian missions. The prospect of a biologically-produced UAV presents numerous advantages over the current manufacturing paradigm. First, a foundational architecture built by cells allows for construction or repair in locations where it would be difficult to bring traditional tools of production. Second, a major limitation of current research with UAVs is the size and high power consumption of analytical instruments, which require bulky electrical components and large fuselages to support their weight. By moving these functions into cells with biosensing capabilities – for example, a series of cells engineered to report GFP, green fluorescent protein, when conditions exceed a certain threshold concentration of a compound of interest, enabling their detection post-flight – these problems of scale can be avoided. To this end, we are working to engineer cells to synthesize cellulose acetate as a novel bioplastic, characterize biological methods of waterproofing the material, and program this material’s systemic biodegradation. In addition, we aim to use an “amberless” system to prevent horizontal gene transfer from live cells on the material to microorganisms in the flight environment.
The core of our project is the application of genes from Pseudomonas fluorescens to produce a novel bioplastic.
SBS iGEM has developed an integrated, multi-component material that is durable, biodegradable, & widely applicable.
