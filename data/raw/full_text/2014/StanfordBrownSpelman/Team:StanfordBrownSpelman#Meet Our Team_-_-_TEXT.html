The 2014 Stanford-Brown-Spelman iGEM Team, featuring NASA Ames Chief Scientist and Brown Alumna, Ellen Stofan.
Eli Block
Eli Block is a third year Brown + RISD Dual Degree student majoring in Industrial Design at RISD and concentrating in Biology at Brown; he's particularly interested in designed ecologies, evolutionary biology, and wearable technology. Eli worked on the wasp protein waterproofing project, built concept UAVs, cooked experimental biomaterials, and developed the team wiki. Eli loves dinosaurs, artificial intelligence, print design, and swimming like a merman in the Brown University pool.
Jovita Byemerwa
Jovita is from Tanzania, and is currently in her third year at Brown University concentrating in Computational Molecular Biology. This summer, she worked on the biodegradability project and explored human practices of UAVs. A huge interest of her's is language: she loves learning them, speaking them and even teaching them. She speaks Kiswahili (her mother tongue), English (of course), Italian and a bit of Spanish.
Ross Dispenza
Ross is a junior at Brown University concentrating in Chemistry and French Studies. He worked on the cellulose acetate and cross-linker projects this summer. In high school, he once won a quiz bowl tournament for his team by answering a question about Lady Gaga.
Benjamin Doughty
Ben is a sophomore at Brown University intending to concentrate in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Over the summer he worked on the Cellulose Acetate and Amberless Hell Cell projects. He can sing the alphabet backwards and once took home third place in a curling tournament. He also LOVES Gossip Girl and Nicolas Cage .
Poorwa Godbole
Poorwa is a junior at Stanford University majoring in Economics and planning to go to medical school after graduation. This summer she worked on the biodegradability and cellulose acetate projects, and made sure to hug each person on the team at least once a day. She enjoys dancing, laughing, and watching Blue Planet on Netflix.
Jeannette Gonzales-Wright
Jeannette is a junior in the Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME) at Brown University. She is concentrating in Science & Society: Health/Medicine. This summer she worked on biodegradability, the human practices of UAVs, and the powerpoint presentation of our research. She identifies as a proud CODA and would prefer to talk to you in American Sign Language than in a spoken language.
Ian Hull
Ian somehow made it through his freshman year at Stanford without sustaining any major chemical burns. Apparently that makes him a sophomore now, and he's interested in bioengineering, chemistry, and science communication. This summer, he worked on the wasp protein and wax ester waterproofing projects. His hobbies include Bollywood dance and playing the trumpet. He loves the ocean and once swam with whale sharks.
Jotthe Kannappan
Jotthe is a small and energetic junior in bioengineering at Stanford University. This summer, she worked primarily with wasp proteins in material waterproofing and biomaterials on the production of cellulose acetate. When she's not pipetting, she can be found humming obnoxiously, dancing, or curled up with a good book.
Alexander Levine
Alex is a junior at Brown University concentrating in Mathematical Physics. This summer, he worked mostly on attempting to make Gluconacetobacter hansenii produce cellulose acetate, and on creating software tools for synthetic biology.
Raman Nelakanti
Raman is the captain of the SBS iGEM team. He recently graduated from Stanford with a major in Bioengineering and worked on the Amberless Hell Cell project this summer. Outside of science, his interests include singing, hiking, exploring, and living life. And one random fact about him - he once serenaded Justice Sandra Day O'Connor!
Lydia Ruffner
Lydia is a recent graduate of Spelman College, where she majored in Biochemistry. Currently she is a first-year PhD student in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Program at Northeastern University. This summer she worked on the Modeling portion of the Cellulose Acetate Project. Outside of the lab, she loves watching football (Go PATRIOTS!!), spending time with her family, and shopping.
Alaina Shumate
Alaina is a junior at Stanford University majoring in bioengineering. This summer she worked on the Amberless Hell Cell and Cellulose Cross-linker projects. While nothing makes her happier than Minipreps, she also enjoys drinking coffee, tap dancing, and convincing people that her home state of Wyoming is actually a fun place.
Aryo Sorayya
Aryo is a sophomore at Stanford University, where he is studying Biochemistry and Computer Science. At Ames, Aryo worked on the Wasp Protein and Biodegradability projects, helped develop the team wiki, and strove to keep lab morale high! Aryo is a cheerful polyglot and enjoys learning about other cultures, playing pranks on his teammates, and traveling the world.
Kyla Ugwu
Kyla Ugwu is a junior biochemistry major, mathematics minor at Spelman College. After graduation, she plans on getting a medical degree and a master’s in public health. During her time at NASA Ames Research Center, she worked on the Biodegradation project and Waterproofing projects. In her free time, she likes to sing with her quintet on campus and go to the movies as many times as her pocketbook will let her.
Meet Our Advisors
Dr. Lynn Rothschild
Lynn is the lead scientist in synthetic biology at NASA Ames Research Center where her lab has been working on cool projects ranging from the search for life in the universe and extremophiles, to pioneering how synthetic biology can be used to address NASA's missions. She is also an adjunct professor at Brown University, inter alia, Brown Home Page . Her lab looks forward to hosting the team every year as they pioneer ways to  take synthetic biology literally "out of this world". PS Yes, she really does play the bagpipes !
Dr. Joseph Shih
Joseph is the wet lab Lecturer in the Bioengineering Department at Stanford University.  He got his Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard University and did his post-doc in Pam Silver's lab at Harvard Medical School.
