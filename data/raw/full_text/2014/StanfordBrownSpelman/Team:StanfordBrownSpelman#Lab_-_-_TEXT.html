General Protocols
Here are links to pages documenting all of our laboratory protocols and procedures, from general lab techniques to special protocols we developed while working on our biological UAV project. For general laboratory protocols with an emphasis on NASA Ames Research Center lab practice, check out the iGEMer's Guide to the Galaxy.
● Using the autoclave, media, and generating antibiotic sticks
● Plates, Liquid Cultures, and Cryostocking
● Miniprep, Nanodrop, and Digestion
● Gel Casting, Loading, Extraction, and Cleanup
● Ligation and Chemically Competent Transformation
● Everything Protein Gel Related
● Everything PCR (Including Gel Extraction)
● Primers and Sequencing
● Using the iGEM Parts Registry
● Culturing Bacillus subtilis
● Site Directed Mutagenesis
New Protocols for 2014
Our projects this year required a few specific protocols that aren't covered in our iGEMer's Guide to the Galaxy. Check them out here!
Detailed Project Journals
Our team documented all of our iGEM work in shared online documents that anyone can view at the following links. Having begun lab work in late May, our team recorded our progress over the course of the summer and into the fall, filing over four months of detailed notes on our many project. Check out the details below:
Biomaterials Project Notebook: Complete documentation of our methods, protocols, and scientific processes can be found in the linked document.
Amberless Hell Cell Project Notebook: Complete documentation of our methods, protocols, and scientific processes can be found in the linked document.
Material Waterproofing Project Notebook: Complete documentation of our methods, protocols, and scientific processes can be found in the linked document.
Biodegradability Project Notebook: Complete documentation of our methods, protocols, and scientific processes can be found in the linked document.
Cellulose Cross-Linker Project Notebook: Complete documentation of our methods, protocols, and scientific processes can be found in the linked document.
