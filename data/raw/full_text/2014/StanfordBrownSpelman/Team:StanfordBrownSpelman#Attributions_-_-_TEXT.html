Stanford–Brown–Spelman iGEM 2014 — BioBricks
Attributions
We would like to thank everyone who contributed to the realization of our project! All that we've done would not be possible with the contributions made by those listed below. On this page, we've listed contributors by project. We've also added sections for our sponsors and for those who made contributions to our team outside of specific projects. Thank you again, everyone, for all you've done!
Biomaterial Production
Tim Cooper at University of Houston for Pseudomonas fluorescens.
Jean-Marie Dimandja at Spelman College for discussions of 2D GC Analysis.
Collaboration: We collaborated with Team Imperial by assisting one another with cellulose-production protocols. We sent them protocols for transforming G. hansenii and we evaluated their protocols for cellulose processing.
Wasp Proteins & Material Waterproofing
Dave Kavanaugh at the California Academy of Sciences for helping us trap wasps.
Durrell Kapan at the California Academy of Sciences for advising us on wasp transcriptome and genome analysis.
Michael Sheehan at UC Berkeley for helping us identify wasp species.
Gary Wessel and his lab staff at Brown University for their help with peptide mass fingerprinting.
Biodegradability
Christopher Voigt at MIT for providing plasmids necessary for making our biodegradation constructs.
Timothy Brown from Thermo Fisher Scientific for teaching us how to use the flow cytometer to collect GFP data.
Policy and Human Practices
Jim Brass , Kevin Reynolds, and Bob Dahlgren for consulting with us about building, flying, and using UAVs.
Mark Segal at the EPA for his input on the regulations surrounding the release of recombinant biological materials into the environment.
Outreach
DNA 2.0 for their advice, sponsorship, and facility tour.
Building the UAV
Ecovative for the production of our mycelium drone components.
AgiC for providing us with silver ink pens for producing drawn circuits and for printing circuits on our cellulose-based biomaterials.
Art & Design
Wiki built using the Zurb Foundation framework and brought to you by iGEM and MediaWiki.
