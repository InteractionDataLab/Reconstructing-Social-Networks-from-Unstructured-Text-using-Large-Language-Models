Stanford–Brown–Spelman iGEM 2014 — BioBricks
Achievements
Following is documentation of the 2014 iGEM Competition judging criteria and how our team fulfilled the various medal requirements. We feel our team performed strongly in a number of areas, and we would like to share our accomplishments! Check them out:
Bronze Medal Requirements
We completed our team registration in April, and plan to attend the iGEM Jamboree in October.
We have completed our Judging Form and submitted it by the October deadline.
We have produced a wiki that documents our team's various project results and the processes we went through to obtain them.
We have prepared a poster and a talk for the 2014 iGEM Jamboree. Registration paid, hotels reserved, UAVs assembled, and rearing to go!
We have acknowledged our advisors, sponsors, and collaborators in the Attributions section of our wiki.
We have documented multiple new standard biobrick Parts or Devices. Check out our BioBricks page for more information about our bricks and find our parts in the registry to see the complete documentation.
Silver Medal Requirements
Experimentally validate at least one biobrick part—we validated the radiation resistance of uvsE.
Document the characterization of the biobrick on the parts registry page and submit part to registry. Both completed for radiation resistance gene uvsE.
Articulate questions about the project and answer them. Visit our Human Practices page to see some of the questions and answers about biological drone use that we generated.
Gold Medal Requirements
In working on our Amberless Hell Cell project, we have improved the functionality of existing BioBricks for reporters (GFP: BBa_E0040 and aeBlue: BBa_K864401) and stress resistance genes (MntH: BBa_K285103), by making UAG-Leucine derivatives of them compatible with our Amberless/UAG-Leucine system.
Imperial collaboration with the acetobacter protocols.
We have been working with the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) to write regulations for synthetic biology use in the environment. Our project addresses policy and outlines best use practices for biological UAVs and environmental safety concerns with respect to synthetic biology that affect the application of synthetic biology across the country. Read more about our collaboration with the EPA to address the release of synthetic organisms into the environment and our evaluation of our own approach on our Human Practices page.
