Stanford–Brown–Spelman iGEM 2014 — BioBricks
BioBricks
A major goal of the iGEM foundation is to allow for the black-boxing of DNA parts that can later be utilized and recombined innovatively to create new, useful things. These black-boxed DNA parts are called BioBricks. Each of our projects has contributed to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts .
Cellulose Acetate
Part BBa_K1499000 : This part is for the wssF region of the wss operon isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens. This operon is responsible for the acetylation of cellulose.
Part BBa_K1499001 : This part is for the wssG region of the wss operon isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens. This operon is responsible for the acetylation of cellulose.
Part BBa_K1499002 : This part is for the wssH region of the wss operon isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens. This operon is responsible for the acetylation of cellulose.
Part BBa_K1499003 : This part is for the wssI region of the wss operon isolated from Pseudomonas fluorescens. This operon is responsible for the acetylation of cellulose.
Cellulose Cross Linker
Part BBa_K1499004 : This part encodes the expression of a cellulose cross linking protein. It contains two different cellulose binding domains taken from species Clostridium cellulovorans, and a streptavidin domain in between that allows living cells expressing a biotinylated AviTag to attach to the cellulose.
Amberless Hell Cell
Part BBa_K1499200 : This part encodes uvsE, a putative UV damage endonuclease found in D. radiodurans that protects cells from radiation-induced DNA damage.
Part BBa_K1499201 : This parts encodes uracil glycosylase 1, a protein involved in the base-excision repair pathway that protects cells from DNA damage by removing uracil residues from the DNA double helix.
Part BBa_K1499202 : This parts encodes uracil glycosylase 2, a protein involved in the base-excision repair pathway that protects cells from DNA damage by removing uracil residues from the DNA double helix.
Part BBa_K1499203 : This part encodes the SdaB protein generator with 5 UAG stop codons incorporated at leucine residues. Serine deamine B is a protein involved in resistance to alkaline conditions.
Part BBa_K1499205 : This part encodes the manganese transporter MntH with a UAG stop codon in place of a leucine and a promoter for expression. MntH is involved with manganese homeostasis, a critical process for dealing with free radicals generated upon exposure to radiation that could potentially cause DNA damage.
Part BBa_K1499250 : GFP (E0040) with two amber stop codons. This GFP contains two stop codons in place of leucine residues. In an amberless cell that also contains supP tRNA, GFP will be translated normally, otherwise, it will be truncated.
Part BBa_K1499251 : This part encodes the amber-suppressing tRNA supP, a mutant form of the tRNA leuX which normally inserts leucine at UUG. This is a UAG-leucine tRNA, so a leucine is added every time a UAG codon is encountered. 100bp upstream and 50bp downstream are also included to ensure proper splicing and folding.
Part BBa_K1499252 : This part encodes a GFP generator followed by the supP tRNA. The GFP produced is E0040 with 2 UAG stop codons in place of leucine residues, which can only be properly translated in amberless cells also containing supP.
Part BBa_K1499253 : This part encodes an aeBlue generator followed by the supP tRNA. The aeBlue produced is K864401 with 3 UAG stop codons in place of leucine residues, which can only be properly translated in amberless cells also containing supP.
Material Waterproofing
Part BBa_K1499400 : This is one version of a potentially chitin-binding protein (C1) found in the Polistes dominula nest protein samples. It may be responsible for the cellulose-waterproofing capability of oral secretions seen in paper wasp nests. It has been codon-optimized for E. coli expression.
Part BBa_K1499401 : This is another version of a potentially chitin-binding protein (C2) found in the Polistes dominula nest protein samples. It may be responsible for the cellulose-waterproofing capability of oral secretions seen in paper wasp nests. It has been codon-optimized for E. coli expression.
Part BBa_K1499402 : This is a completely uncharacterized protein (U1) from the Polistes dominula nest protein samples that may be a major player in the paper wasp's ability to waterproof cellulose. It has been codon-optimized for E. coli expression.
Biodegradability
Part BBa_K1499500 : This is a part that encodes quorum sensing machinery to activate GFP expression. It is fundamentally a combination of two parts, BBa_I13202 and BBa_T9002 .
Part BBa_K1499501 : This is a part that encodes the endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, or cellulase gene. This protein is a means of breaking down cellulose and is is specific for 1,4-beta linkages in cellulose. It was isolated from Neisseria sicca.
Part BBa_K1499503 : This part is the same as Part BBa_K1499500 but has two more terminators between the luxR gene and the luxPR promoter.
