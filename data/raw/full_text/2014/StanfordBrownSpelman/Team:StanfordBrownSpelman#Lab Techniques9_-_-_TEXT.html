Stanford–Brown–Spelman iGEM 2014 — Amberless Hell Cell
iGEM and the Registry of
Standard Biological Parts
Using the Parts Registry
Detailed instructions for locating a particular part and reconstituting that DNA from the iGEM distribution plates can be found here. The plates are currently stored in the freezer in room 378.
Important points:
Transform the DNA into an E. coli cloning strain e.g. DH5α. As always when generating a new strain: grow a liquid culture, cryostock the strain, and miniprep to have a source of the DNA.
Creating a Registry Page for a New Part
The iGEM site guides you through this pretty well. From the main page for the Registry you will see a link for 'add a part' and go from there. You will have options for submitting basic parts or composite parts; usually whatever functional unit you end up using in the iGEM projects will be a composite part, but for every composite part you'll also want to create an individual part page for the basic parts from which it is made In fact, the basic parts pages should be made first, so you can reference them in creating the page for the composite part.
