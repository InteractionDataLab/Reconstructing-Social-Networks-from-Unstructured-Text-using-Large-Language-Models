Reverse Transcriptase to get cDNA
In a sterile microfuge tube add:
RNA solution 1ng-1 µg total RNA or 1-100 ng polyA-selected RNA
Primer (50uM dT or 60uM Random Primer Mix) 2 µL 10mM dNTP mix 1 µL
nuclease-free H2O to final volume of 12 µL
(optional) Heat for 3-5 minutes at 65-70°C. Spin briefly and place promptly on ice.
Add:
5X ProtoScript II RT Reaction bufferr   4 µL
0.1M DTT   2ul
murine RNAse inhibitor (40U/ul)   1 µL
ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase   (200U/ul)   1 µL
So that the final volume is at 20 µL
Incubate at 42C for 30min-1hr. If Random Primer Mix is used, an incubation step at 25°C for 5 minutes is recommended before the 42°C incubation.
Inactivate enzyme at 80°C for 5 minutes.
Store products at -20°C or proceed to next step(s)
PCR
Assemble all reaction components on ice and quickly transfer the reaction components on ice and quickly transfer the reactions to a thermocycler preheated to the denaturation temperature (98 C). All components should be mixed prior to use.

Gently mix the reaction. Collect all liquid to the bottom of the tube by a quick spin if necessary
Transfer PCR tubes to a PCR machine and begin thermocycling. Begin initial denaturation at 98 C for 30 seconds. Then, for 25-35 cycles:
Run for 5-10 seconds at 98 C
Run for 10-30 seconds at a temperature between 50-72 degrees C. (The exact temperature is determined by the primers used).
Run for 20-30 seconds per kb at 72 C.
Run for 2 minutes at 72 C.
Pause the PCR at 4 C
Gel Electrophoresis
Creating the Agarose Gel:
Measure out 1g of agarose
Pour agarose power into microwaveable flask along with 100mL of 1X TAE
Microwave until the agarose is completely dissolved and there is a ncie roiling boil (1-3 minutes).
Let the agarose solution cool down for 5 minutes.
Pour the agarose into a gel tray with the well comb in place.
Place the newly poured gel at 4 C for 10-15 minutes or let sit at room temperature until it has completely solidified.
Loading Samples and Running the Gel:
Add 2.5 uL loading dye to 7.5 uL of each sample.
Once solidified, place the agarose gel into the gel box.
Fill the gel box with 1xTAE until the gel is covered.
Carefully load a molecular weight ladder (8 uL) into one of the lanes.
Carefully load your samples into the additional wells of the gel (10uL of each sample)
Run the gel at 120 V until the dye line is approximately 75-80% of the way down the gel
Turn OFF power, disconnect the electrodes from the power source, and then carefully remove the gel from the gel box.
Using UV light box, visualize DNA fragments

Notes before starting:
Add lyseblue reagent to Buffer P1 at a ratop pf 1:1000.
Add the provided RNAse A solution to Buffer P1,mix, and store at 2-8 C
Add ethanol (96-100&#37) to Buffer PE before use.
All centrifugation steps are arried out at 13,000 rpm in a conventional tabletop microcentrifudge.
Pellet 1-5 mL bacterial overnight culture by centrifugation at >8000 rpm for 3 mins at room remperature (15-25 C)
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 uL Buffer P1 and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube
Add 250 uL Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times until the solution becomes clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 minutes. If using Lyseblue reagent, the solution will turn blue.
Add 350 uL Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times. If using lyseblue reagent, the solution will turn colorless.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm in a table-top microcentrifuge
Apply the supernatant from Step 5 to the QiAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting. Centrifuge for 30-60s and discard flow-through.
Wash the QiAlprep spin column by adding 500 uL Buffer PB. Centrifuge for 30-60 s and discard flow-through
Wash the QiAprep spin column by adding 750 uL Buffer PE. Centrifuge for 30-60s and discard the flowthrough. Transfer the QiAprep spin column to the collection tube.
Centrifuge for 1 min to remove residual wash buffer
Place the QiAprep column in a clean 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50 uL Buffer EB or water to the center of the QiAprep spin column, let it stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min
