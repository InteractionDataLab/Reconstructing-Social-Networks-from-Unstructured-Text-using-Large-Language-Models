When I actually have time, I love to go out into the world and explore, always looking to have new experiences. I am hoping to go to grad school after Stony Brook where my research will conveniently take me to exotic places.</P><P><I>Favorite Lab Moment:</I>When we found out about our anonymous donor because it meant that the work we were putting in meant something to someone.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="helen"><DIV class="bio"><H1>Helen Liu</H1><P>Year: SophomoreMajor: Chemical Engineering</P><P>I've often been told I have a surprising sense of humor. Sometimes I even surprise myself. In my free time, I like to watch TV, or sleep, or fall asleep while watching TV. After helping to build the wiki, I'm looking forward to not looking at HTML/CSS for very long time.</P><P><I>Favorite Lab Moment:</I>When Nic, Gurkamal and I masterminded a kidnapping of Gouda's origami cranes when he went on vacation. (But we all know the real mastermind was me.)</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="janki"><DIV class="bio"><H1>Janki Patel</H1><P>Year: SophomoreMajor: Biochemistry</P><P>One day I plan to one day attend medical school and eventually achieve a career as a doctor.  After shadowing around the medical field for a year, the study of the brain has particularly fascinated me, so neurology is a field that I'm looking to pursue.  While  attending Stony Brook, I will further my knowledge in these areas and contribute to my community through both volunteering and research.</P><P><I>Favorite Lab Moment:</I>The first time I ever touched anything in the lab. A gel crumbled in my hands and I was afraid to do any lab work for a solid month</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="maryam"><DIV class="bio"><H1>Maryam Ige</H1><P>Year: JuniorMajor: Biomedical Engineering</P><P>I’ve often been told that I am a challenge driven person. I can’t help that I relish the feeling of accomplishment. So I’m often in situations where I am testing my limits. But what THE ultimate challenge to me is, is dabbling in the impossible; having my imagination brought to life. Hence, iGEM was like a blessing for me: it empowered with the opportunity to create biological systems not found in nature. So cool!!!!</P><P><I>Favorite Lab Moment:</I>When I became a pro in origami. Thanks Helen!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="kamal"><DIV class="bio"><H1>Gurkamal Kaur</H1><P>Year: JuniorMajor: Biology</P><P>Hello my name is Gurkamal Kaur! Here at Stony Brook, I am pursuing a career in medicine and hope to become a future educator in the medical field. Every summer, I participate in a summer day camp and teach elementary school children reading and math skills. It is quite satisfying to know you are making a difference in a child's life and inspiring them to learn while having fun!  In my free time, I like to engage in long distance running and playing the lovely sport of volleyball! Above all, there is nothing quite like going hiking with my amazing dog, Oreo! </P><P><I>Favorite Lab Moment:</I>Streaming the FIFA world cup in lab. Talk about multi-tasking! </P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="karen"><DIV class="bio"><H1>Karen Wong</H1><P>Year: JuniorMajor: BiologyMinor: Biomedical Engineering</P><P>I'm on the Pre-Med track, but after joining the iGEM team, I realized that I should keep an open mind to graduate school or a career in different areas of science and medicine. I am very outspoken about my thoughts on feminism and the equality between men and women, but I am constantly learning new perspectives and ideas that add to my knowledge of the issue. I want boys and girls to grow up with as few differences as possible.</P><P><I>Favorite Lab Moment:</I>Debating with Greg as to why I don’t like the term “chick flick.”</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="gouda"><DIV class="bio"><H1>Mohamed Gouda</H1><P>Year: JuniorMajor: Biochemistry</P><P>I hold a number of interests outside of studying and pursuing a career in medicine. High on that list would have to be chess. I enjoy playing, learning, and even watching games of chess. I'm also a fan of watching films; drama, comedy, thriller, you name it, I enjoy it. </P><P><I>Favorite Lab Moment:</I>That one time I did something so cool Nic ripped his shorts.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="andrew"><DIV class="bio"><H1>Andrew Xu</H1><P>Year: SophomoreMajor: Biology</P><P>My absolute favorite thing to do in the world is to take a nap. I never quite get enough sleep as a pre-medical student. Of course, I still love studying for my science courses because I aspire to practice in the field of sports medicine. In between the long arduous hours at the library, I do enjoy training as a powerlifter in the gym and hunting for my next junk food fix. But, if you see me, I will love you very much if you can spare a cup of black coffee or an energy drink!</P><P><I>Favorite Lab Moment:</I>That one day Helen didn't hate me.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="nic"><DIV class="bio"><H1>Nicolai Tayco</H1><P>Year: SophomoreMajor: BiochemistryMinor: Studio Art</P><P>My dream, aside from continuing research and going to medical school, is to is to pursue my love of art. I initially planned on droppping it after high school so I can focus on my major, but I just couldn't stay away from it. I've heard a lot of arguments for the discontinuation of art education in schools, but the arts and sciences go hand-in-hand more than people realize. I believe in a well-rounded education for future generations.</P><P><I>Favorite Lab Moment:</I>That one time Gouda did something so cool I ripped my shorts.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="tenzing"><DIV class="bio"><H1>Tenzing Lama</H1><P>Year: SeniorMajor: BiochemistryMinor: Chemistry</P><P>Hi! My name is Tenging Lama. After taking several upper level science courses, and working in an organic synthesis laboratory, I have developed a serious knack of learning more sciences, and I am extremely interested in pursuing my own independent research sometime in the future. In my free time, I like to get together with my good friends and travel to new exciting places. </P><P><I>Favorite Lab Moment:</I>“That’s it!” – Only few would understand this catchphrase!</P></DIV></DIV><DIV id="millie"><DIV class="bio"><H1>Millicent Mulieri</H1><P>Year: SophomoreMajor: BiochemistryMinor: Political Science</P><P>My name is Millicent Mulieri, but I go by Millie. I am an active member of the Global Medical Brigades and plan on joining Doctors Without Borders upon completion of medical school. My ultimate goal is to set up free healthcare clinics throughout South America and provide medical care to all of those in need. A few of my hobbies include: playing soccer, singing, and making lame jokes.</P><P><I>Favorite Lab Moment:</I>When Greg finally admitted to us being best friends(although some may doubt it ever happened).</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
