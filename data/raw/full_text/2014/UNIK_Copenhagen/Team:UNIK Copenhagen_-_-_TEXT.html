WELCOME TO OUR WIKI
Welcome to our wiki! Unfortunately, we had to put the project down. So no more work will be done on the wiki. But you are still welcome to have a look around and read about the work that we have already done.
ARE YOU A BUILDER?
We will try to make a clickable wiki with several click and learn features. You can already click on some of the pictures. Try it out!
Are synthetic biology and/or iGEM new to you? Then click on 'Synthetic biology' in the menu or on the picture in this box.
Try to make your own construct and se if you a ready for next year's iGEM! Click on 'Make your own construct' in the menu.
EASY - OUR PROJECT
Demands for fast, cheap and environmentally responsible detection methods are rising. To accommodate this, the iGEM Team of the University of Copenhagen aims at creating a bio-engineered diagnostic tool based on antibodies with novel fluorescent markers for a fast, non-toxic and easy-to-use detection of pathogens. We call it EASY - Engineered Antibody Sensing.
We want our bio-detection tool to be both environmentally responsible and effective without relying on trained personnel. By using bacteria and yeast as our production platform, we aim at reducing cost, chemicals and waste in production. Click here to read more about our project.
WHO ARE WE?
We are an international team of 4 students - Cecilie, Henrik, Morten and Owik - based at the University of Copenhagen. More information will come soon!
