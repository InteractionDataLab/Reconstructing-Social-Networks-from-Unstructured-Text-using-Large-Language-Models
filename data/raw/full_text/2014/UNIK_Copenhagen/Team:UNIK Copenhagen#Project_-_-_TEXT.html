BIOSENSORS WITH NOVEL FLUORESCENT MARKERS
Demands for fast, cheap and environmentally responsible detection methods are rising. To accomondate this we aim at creating a bio-engineered diagnostic tool based on antibodies with novel flourescent markers for a fast, non-toxic and easy-to-use detection of pathogens.
Our project focuses on the construction of a fluorescent antibody fragment. For this purpose we are using a FAB fragment. A FAB fragment consists of a heavy- and light-chain part in the N-terminus of an antibody, containing both a variable and a conserved region. The variable region recognizes and binds to the antigen while the conserved region add stability to the FAB. We use novel florescent markers to detect the binding of a FAB to an antigen. To achieve our goal we take two different approaches: In the first approach a tripartite split GFP system is employed. Click here to read more about the tripartite split GFP project. The second approach is the construction of a FAB that is covalently linked to a fluorophore at the N-terminal site.  Click here to read more about the quenchibody project.
To better understand the dynamics and thus predict functions we have modelled the complexes used in this study and other antibodies as well. We have chosen three distinct antibodies for this project but the conserved nature of antibodies shown in our modelling suggest that the method of creation fluorescent detectors - we have engineered - will possibly be applicable to other antibodies and systems with the same physiochemical dynamics.
