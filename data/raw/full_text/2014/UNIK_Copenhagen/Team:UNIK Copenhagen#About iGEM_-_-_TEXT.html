WHAT IS iGEM?
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is a competition in the field of synthetic biology for under- and overgraduate students ranging over a wide area of disciplines. Each team starts out with a small tool box containing basic building blocks, the BioBricks, needed in their wet lab work. After choosing a project and a track each team builds on basis of those bricks new BioBricks specific to their project and those will be included in the future registry of parts.
Besides the actual laboratory work, the teams are encouraged to promote synthetic biology in public by trying to create understanding and knowledge. Thereby, their own project helps them to present and represent themselves and iGEM as ambassadors of synthetic biology.
