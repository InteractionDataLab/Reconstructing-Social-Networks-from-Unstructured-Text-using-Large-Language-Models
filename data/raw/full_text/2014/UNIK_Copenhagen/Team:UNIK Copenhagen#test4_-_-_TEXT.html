WELCOME TO OUR WIKI
Welcome to our wiki! It is currently under construction. More information, photos etc. will come as our work proceeds, so please just have a look around.
We will try to make a clickable wiki with several click and learn features. You can already click on some of the pictures. Try it out!
SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY & iGEM
Are synthetic biology and/or iGEM new to you? Then click on 'Synthetic biology' in the menu or on the picture in this box.
Are you a builder? You can try to make your own construct! Click on 'about iGEM' in the menu.
EASY - OUR PROJECT
Demands for fast, cheap and environmentally responsible detection methods are rising. To accommodate this, the iGEM Team of the University of Copenhagen aims at creating a bio-engineered diagnostic tool based on antibodies with novel fluorescent markers for a fast, non-toxic and easy-to-use detection of pathogens. We call it EASY - Engineered Antibody Sensing.
We want our bio-detection tool to be both environmentally responsible and effective without relying on trained personnel. By using bacteria and yeast as our production platform, we aim at reducing cost, chemicals and waste in production. Click here to read more about our project.
WHO ARE WE?
We are an international team of 5 students based at the University of Copenhagen.
