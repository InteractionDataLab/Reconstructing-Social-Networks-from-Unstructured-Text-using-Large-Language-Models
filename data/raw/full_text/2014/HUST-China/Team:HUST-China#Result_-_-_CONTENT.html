In our teams experiment, we optimized the experiment procedure based on preliminary test and we can find that the relative fluorescent intensity increases obviously with the increase of the concentration of copper ions, which indicates that the transcriptional rate is positively correlated to the concentration of copper ions. 
  The experimental result was in line with our expectations, so that we can ensure the circuit working normally.</P><H4 align="left">3. Characterization of flA and oprF</H4><P><B>3.1.1	Protein expression of oprF</B>
  Plasmid pET28a-oprF was transformed into <EM>E. coli</EM> BL21(DE3) for protein expression analysis. The strain was grown in Luria broth containing 100ug/ml kanamycin at 37℃, 250rpm/min until an absorbance of 0.4–0.6 at 600 nm was reached. We then added IPTG to 0.5mM and continued the incubation at 28℃ overnight to induce the overexpression of oprF. The cells were collected, suspended with 10mM imidazole containing 0.1mM protease inhibitor PMSF and then disrupted using Selecta Sonopuls. After centrifugation, the sediment was treated with 1*SDS gel loading buffer and kept in boiling water for 5 minutes and applied to SDS-PAGE. </P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Figure 3.1:</B> SDS page test of purified recombinant oprF and flA protein.</P><H4 align="left">4. Immunofluorescence analysis of oprF</H4><P>To identify that whether our oprF has anchored on the cell membrane of <EM>E. coli</EM>, we performed immunofluorescence assay. HA tag was added to the N-terminal of oprF-GS(linker)-CBP so that the recombinant protein oprF-GS(linker)-CBP-HA can be specifically recognized by anti-HA antibody. When FITC labeled anti-IgG antibody was used as the secondary antibody and interacted with the primary antibody, green fluorescence could be observed in the cell membrane of <EM>E. coli</EM> under fluorescent microscope.</P><P><B>Figure 4.1: </B>model and result of immunofluorescence analysis of oprF displayed on <EM>E. coli</EM></P><H4 align="left">5.

Then, we further investigated its capacity to absorb Cu<SUP>2+</SUP> when incubated in Cu<SUP>2+</SUP>-rich environment. Samples of culture medium in different stages was collected and assayed to identify the Cu<SUP>2+</SUP> concentration using BCO method (see more detail of BCO method).</P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Figure 5.1: </B>demonstration of BCO reaction test</P><P> </P><P>The complexation between Oxalic acid bis-(cyclohexylidene hydrazide) (BCO) and Cu<SUP>2+</SUP> will be triggered when the pH reaches to 7~9 and generates a kind of blue clathrate, of which the absorbance at 600nm is linearly correlated with the concentration of Cu<SUP>2+</SUP>.

Growth curves test </H4><P>To ensure the survival of our <EM>E. worker</EM> in industrial sewage, we grew <EM>E. coli</EM> carrying parts in medium containing corresponding pollutant, and measured the OD<SUB>600</SUB> of the culture to draw the growth curve. We cloned the part responsible for the removal of each kind of pollutant, specifically copper, cyanide and fluoride, into vector pET28a respectively. The part is under the regulation of T7 promoter. After transformed into <EM>E. coli</EM> BL21 strain, IPTG was added to induce expression. <EM>E. coli</EM> carrying pET28a backbone was used as negative control.
The number of bacteria in medium is judged by OD<SUB>600</SUB>. The higher the OD<SUB>600</SUB>, the more bacteria the medium contains. So we take the OD<SUB>600</SUB> value as the bacteria growth.</P><P><B>6.1 Growth curves test of flA</B></P><P> </P><P> </P><P><B>6.1.1  The growth curve of fluorine-containing sewage gradient of transformants</B></P><P><B>Figure 6.1:</B> The growth curve of flA expression strains and control in LB culture medium, compared to control, flA expression did not significantly reduce the growth of our bacteria.  </P><P> </P><P><B>Figure 6.2:</B> The results were right on target with our expectations. Presence of fluoride ion pollutant environment, flA transformants did have a better growth advantage than control.</P><P> </P><P><B>6.2	 Growth curves of oprF-CBP and oprF-GS(linker)-CBP</B>
  We constructed the plasmid pET28a-oprF-CBP and get the growth curve of it first.</P><P style="text-align:center"><B> Figure 6.3: </B>Growth curve of normal bacteria carrying vector in culture environment with or without Cu2+. </P><P>Under high concentration of copper ions, bacteria significantly grow slower than that in normal water. It revealed that the high concentration of copper ion is indeed harmful to the growth of bacteria. </P><P><B> Figure 6.4:</B> Growth curve of bacteria carrying vector/oprF-CBP/oprF-GS-CBP in culture environment with different Cu2+ concentration.</P><P>Contrary to our expectation, the growth of bacteria carrying oprF-CBP grew as normal as control bacteria carrying pET28a vector in Cu<SUP>2+</SUP> environment. The possible reason is that fusion-expressed CBP and oprF are so close to affect the function of CBP. Without CBP capable of binding to copper ions, the <EM>E. coli</EM> carrying oprF-CBP loses its tolerance of high concentration of Cu<SUP>2+</SUP>. Meanwhile, the expression of heterologous protein reduces the competitive advantage of our transformant. These two mechanisms work together to result in the slow growth of <EM>E. coli</EM> carrying oprF-CBP. To cope with the problem, we added a GS-linker between oprF and CBP to reduce the spatial interaction. We were very excited to see that our method works! The growth of E. coli carrying oprF-GS-CBP is significantly and consistently better than that of <EM>E. coli</EM> carrying oprF-CBP or pET28a vector. It proves that 1) a GS-linker is necessary for the normal function of CBP when expressed as a fusion protein with oprF; 2) our oprF-GS-CBP motif can effectively increase <EM>E. coli</EM>'s the tolerance of Cu<SUP>2+</SUP>. </P><P> </P><P> </P><H1 id="h2_0" align="left">Device</H1><H4 align="left">7. Rotating Biological Contactor (RBC)</H4><P>The removal of heavy metals from diluted industrial sewage is impractical due to the inadequacy of traditional treatments (e.g. chemical precipitation and evaporation). Luckily, we have Bio-adsorption now, an alternative method that is highly efficient and produces no secondary pollution. The rotating biological contactor (RBC), which is very potent, efficient and can make good use of byproducts like sludge, is now widely used in sewage treatment. In RBC, toxic metals are sequestered and adsorbed onto biological materials, which are cheap and easy to deal with. In this way, the adsorbed metals can be recycled and the biological materials can be reused. However, traditional RBC can only be applied to domestic sewage. To expand RBC's application to industry, in our project, we redesigned and improved the traditional RBC.</P><P> </P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Figure 7.1:</B> 3D model of our RBC device</P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Figure 7.2:</B> A real object model of our RBC device</P><P>For more information of our toolkit, please <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:HUST-China/Toolkit">ENTER HERE</A></P><DIV id="side_bar"><DIV class="anchor-h2" id="h2num_1"><P style="text-align:right" class="h2_0"><A href="#Parts">Parts</A></P></DIV><DIV class="anchor-h2" id="h2num_1"><P style="text-align:right" class="h2_1"><A href="#Characterization">Characterization</A></P></DIV><DIV class="anchor-h2" id="h2num_1"><P style="text-align:right" class="h2_2"><A href="#Growth curves">Growth curves</A></P></DIV><DIV class="anchor-h2" id="h2num_1"><P style="text-align:right" class="h2_2"><A href="#Device">Device</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="address"><P>E-mail: byl.hust.china@gmail.com</P><P>HUST, China</P></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
