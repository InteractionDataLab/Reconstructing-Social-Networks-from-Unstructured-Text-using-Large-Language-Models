Team:HUST-China/Team/YuqingWang
From 2014.igem.org
Yuqing Wang
I was a senior in HUST and it’s my first  time as an iGEMer. In the team, I am responsible for the art design including  the web, poster, team uniform and something else. When I designed the team  logo, I have wavered over whether to take advise from my teammates or to insist  my own opinion. I'm not good at making a decision but I will try to get more  experience and patience in the teamwork.
