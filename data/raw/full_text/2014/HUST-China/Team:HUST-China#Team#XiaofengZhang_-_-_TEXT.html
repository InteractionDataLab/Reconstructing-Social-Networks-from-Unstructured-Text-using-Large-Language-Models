Xiaofeng Zhang
I'm a senior in HUST Life School and I’m going to be a PhD student in structure  biology.  Although I was new to iGEM, I was soon attracted by the idea and principle  of synthetic biology. In our team, I mainly responsible for circuit designing,  vector constructing, protein expression and data collection. I love doing  experiment and can always have fun from it.
