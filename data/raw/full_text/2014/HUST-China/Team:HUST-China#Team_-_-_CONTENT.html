</P><H3>Jiajun Tan</H3><P>I'm entering my junior year at HUST in bioscience. In the team, I am in charge of arranging experiments and standardizing parts. It's really an agreeable and unforgettable experience to be in such an amazing team and fight together with so many amazing teammates.  
</P><H3>Shuyan Tang </H3><P>I am a junior in bioscience, and it is the first year I participate in iGEM. In the team, I am responsible for some of the experiment and nearly in charge of all the events about team-communication as a representative of our team. Participating in iGEM was definitely one of the most wonderful in my life, because it expanded my vision, most important of all I got precious friendship from it.
</P><H3>Zhang Xiaofeng</H3><P>I’m a senior in HUST Life School and I’m going to be a PhD student in structure biology. Although I was new to iGEM, I was soon attracted by the idea and principle of synthetic biology. In our team, I am mainly responsible for circuit designing, vector constructing, protein expression and data collection. I love doing experiment and can always have fun from it.</P><H3>Xue Zeng</H3><P>This is my senior year at HUST in biological science, and I’m honored to say that this is my third year to be an iGEMer. This year, I’m in charge of constructing two expression vectors in our Instructor, writing documents and giving presentation. It's really a great and unforgettable experience to be in such an amazing team and fight together with so many amazing people.</P><H3>An  Yan </H3><P>I am a senior student in biotechnology. And this is the second year for me to be a member of iGEM-HUST.I am responsible for constructing several vectors which are core of this year's project. This is amazing to stand a chance to work with these excellent people!
</P><H3>Lu Wang</H3><P> I am a senior student in biotechnology. I am responsible for constructing vectors used in our worker. I am honored to become an iGEMer to take part in such an interesting competition. I got a lot during the process, knowledge, experiment skills, friendship and so on. It gives me beautiful memories of my university.
</P><H3>Qing Zhang</H3><P>In iGEM hust, I’ve experienced how to consummate an idea, how to complete a task using my own mind. To construct a plasmid with Ompc and CBP/His, approximately 3 months was spent because of a tiny error; for the growth curves of E. coli with vectors containing different genes, we worked all day. One year, we worked together for one aim. To my team members, my dear friends, I’d like to say lucky to be with you.
</P><H3>Lei  Yin </H3><P>I am a junior in biotechnology now. In the team, I am responsible for constructing the anchor protein-copper chelation vectors and planning our Human Practice. I really enjoyed the time working with my teammates and the wonderful experience made a better me. Life is short, I will always try my best to do the things I love. It’s now or never.
</P><H3>Danyang Wang </H3><P>I am a junior in bioinformatics. And in this team, I am a member of wet lab group. I participated in the work of cyanide part and growth curve. I learnt a lot in the whole year teamwork--a crazy heart for the project and the hard work for final result. iGEM is a great platform for us to play with biology. So just imagine, and you will make it. Beside, I love singing.
</P><H3>ZiangZhang</H3><P>I was a sophomore in bio-science when I became a member of iGEMers. Now I am still a sophomore in BME. As an experiment members in the team, most of my work is about Human Practice and Future Work. I like traveling and reading, and my idol is Steven Jobs.
</P><H3>Yuanxin  Wang </H3><P>I’m a senior student in biomedical science. And this is the second year for me to be an iGEMer. Although most of my classes tells me how to be a good experimentalist, I’m in charge of modelling part in the team. Most of my work is transforming the biological process into a mathematical model and doing some data analysis. I enjoy reading and listening to soft music in my spare time. Besides, I’m always dreaming to have enough time to paint a picture about the school to memorize the four years I've spent.
</P><H3>Ruihao Li</H3><P>Now I major bioscience in the Life School of Huazhong University of Sci &amp; Tec. I have taken part in the mathematical modelling and human practice. It may sound a little unusual that I'm a member of software which has nothing to do with my major. But I love mathematical modeling and programming.
</P><H3>Yiwen Ping</H3><P>It’s my first time as an iGEMer. In the team, I am responsible for the art design, so we communicate frequently to get all opinions. It’s great to be with all the members here.
</P><H3>Huabin Wang</H3><P>I am a senior student from school of Enivronmental Science and Engineering.
I am in charge of the design of equipment and drawing some schematics. I believe our work is meaningful and extremely useful. As the old Chinese saying goes, where there is a will, there is a way.

</P><P>It’s my first time as an iGEMer. In the team, I am responsible for the art design, so we communicate frequently to get all opinions. It’s great to be with all the members here.
</P><H3>Yuqing Wang</H3><P>I was a senior in HUST and it’s my first time as an iGEMer. In the team, I am responsible for the art design including the web, poster, team uniform and something else. When I designed the team logo, I have wavered over whether to take advice from my teammates or to insist my own opinion. I'm not good at making a decision but I will try to get more experience and patience in the teamwork.
</P><H3>Jianjie  Zhao </H3><P>I am a student majoring applied mathematics, a traditional math work, which is also called &quot;paper and pencil work&quot;. In the team, most my work is functional and data analysis, with many helpful softwares, especially matlab. Although I am a new iGEMer, I’d love to do my best to help my teammates, if they need me.
</P><H3>Siyang Liu</H3><P>I'm a student in school of Mechanical &amp; Eleccal Engineering. I took delight in coding. Nice to be a iGEMer and I'll keep working on it.</P><H3>Yali Bai</H3><P>I’m a junior now. Lucky to be an iGEMer, I’m involved in wiki writing and coding. It’s an unforgettable experience for my college time.
