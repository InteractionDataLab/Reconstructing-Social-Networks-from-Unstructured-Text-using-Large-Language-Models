Xue Zeng
This is my senior year at HUST in biological science, and I’m honored to say that this is my third year to be an iGEMer. This year, I’m in charge of constructing two expression vectors in our Instructor, writing documents and giving presentation. It's really a great and unforgettable experience to be in such an amazing team and fight together with so many amazing people.
