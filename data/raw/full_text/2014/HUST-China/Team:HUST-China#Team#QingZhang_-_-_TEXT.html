Qing Zhang
In  iGEM hust, I’ve experienced how to consummate a idea, how to complete a task  using my own mind. For constructing a plasmid with Ompc and CBP/His,  approximately 3 months was spent because of a tiny error; for the growth curves  of E. coli with vectors containing different genes, we work all day. One year,  we worked together for one aim. To my team members, my dear friends, I’d like  to say lucky to be with you.
