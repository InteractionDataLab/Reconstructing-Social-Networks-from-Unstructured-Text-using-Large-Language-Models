Ruihao Li
My name is Li Ruihao and now I major  bioscience in the Life School of Huazhong University of Sci & Tec.I have  taken part in the mathematical modelling and human practice.It may sound a  little unusual that I'm a member of software which has nothing to do with my  major.But I love mathematical modeling and programming.
