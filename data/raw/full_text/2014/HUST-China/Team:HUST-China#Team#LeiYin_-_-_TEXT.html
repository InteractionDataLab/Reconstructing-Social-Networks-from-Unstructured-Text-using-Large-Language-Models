Lei Yin
I am a junior in biotechnology now. In the  team, I am responsible for constructing the anchor protein-copper chelation  vectors and planning for our Human Practice. I really enjoyed the time working  with my teammates and the wonderful experience made a better me. Life is short,  I will always try my best to do the things I love. It's now or never.
