The harm of water containing excess copper</H3><P>Some people who drink water containing copper in excess of the action level may, with short term exposure, experience gastrointestinal distress, and with long-term exposure may experience liver or kidney damage. For people with Wilson's Disease, we strongly advise them to consult their personal doctor if the amount of copper in their water exceeds the action level.</P><H3 align="left">2.  The harm of water containing excess cyanide </H3><P>CN<SUP>-</SUP> is extremely toxic to fish. The minimum lethal dose for carps is 0.2 ppm. WHO (World Health Organization) stipulates that the intoxication limit for fish is 0.03mg/L free cyanide ions. Cyanide can enter the body via contacting with skin, cavity mucous membrane, inhaling, taking orally, injection, etc. After entering the body, cyanide dissociates into CN<SUP>-</SUP>. CN<SUP>-</SUP> can prevent Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> from transforming into Fe<SUP>2+</SUP>, which causes the failure of a series of biochemical reactions, thus leads to the death of cells due to the shortage of oxygen. Meanwhile, the central nervous system loses its function rapidly due to the lack of ATP produced through respiration. Then the symptoms of respiratory muscle paralysis, cardiac arresting and multiple organ failure follow, leading to death promptly.</P><H3 align="left">3.  The harm of water containing excess fluoride</H3><P>After fluoride entering human body, only half can be excreted via metabolism; the other half will accumulate in our body, mainly in teeth and bones. Excessive amount of fluoride inhibits the activity of some enzymes, damages the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus as well as causes serious diseases related bones (e.g. periosteum proliferation). It is also indicated that fluoride is a powerful central nervous system (CNS) toxin and might adversely affect human brain functioning even at low doses. In addition, even fluoride not directly untaken by human is dangerous. Fluoride not only has an adverse effect on plants, but also can be passed on through food chain, thus harming animals and humans.</P><H1 align="left" id="h2_1">Part 2: Weaknesses of current treating method</H1><H3 align="left">Copper ion</H3><P>The main copper wastewater treatments include chemical precipitation, ion exchange, and electrolysis method. <SUP>[2]</SUP> 
                         As a result of the different production processes, the valence state and station of copper ions in wastewater have their own special properties.
                         The Chemical precipitation method produces sludge containing heavy metal ions, which can cause serious secondary pollution. The Electrolysis method is inefficient and needs too much energy. The ion exchange method has a good extraction, but the high cost of the resin makes it completely unsuitable for an industrial process. <SUP>[3]</SUP> Treatment for different types of wastewater containing copper should be based on the nature of the wastewater. In order to meet emission standards, different process or combination of processes should be exerted for treating different types of wastewater. <SUP>[4]</SUP> Meanwhile, when dealing with wastewater containing copper, a very useful metal in industry, the recycle of it, should also be taken into consideration.</P><H3 align="left">Cyanide </H3><P>The choice of treatments for wastewater containing cyanide depends on the concentration of cyanide. For high concentration of CN<SUP>-</SUP>, recovery method is applied; while for low concentration of CN<SUP>-</SUP>, treatment method is used. Recovery methods include acidified alkali-aeration absorption and steam desorption. Treatment methods include alkaline chlorination, electrolytic oxidation, pressure hydrolysis, biochemical treatment, biological iron method, ferrous sulfate method and air stripping. Unfortunately all these methods have some unavoidable disadvantages. The industrial process of some methods, such as the Acidification, the chlorination and the SO<SUB>2</SUB>-AIR method, are very complex and cost a lot. The hydrogen peroxide method and the ozone oxidation can't deal with some kinds of cyanate. Given the low degradation efficiency, further treatment is still needed after the electrolytic oxidation or some traditional treatment like chemical precipitation.</P><H3 align="left">Fluoride</H3><P>Traditionally, there're two treatments for fluoridated water, specifically using lime to neutralize and precipitate F<SUP>-</SUP> in water and using coagulating sedimentation with CaCl<SUB>2</SUB>-lime.The problems of the two treatments include the demand for very large amount of neutralizer, the production of large amount of sludge, the difficulty in dehydration and the difficulty in reusing sludge. And both of the two treatments have high cost a limited processing capacity.</P><H1 align="left" id="h2_2">Part 3: Strength of our <EM>E. kungfu</EM> treating method</H1><P>Our <EM>E. kungfu</EM> is capable of forming a biofilm, which can sense the specific heavy metal, and activate a cell surface display system that acts to remove and recycle copper ion. In addition, it has the amazing ability to degrade the main metallurgy pollutants, cyanide and fluoride, in wastewater directly.
                         The rotating biological contactor (RBC) we designed makes this process more feasible. The disc rotates to let the biofilm touch the wastewater in a suitable rate, thus enables our <EM>E. kungfu</EM> to absorb copper ion, cyanide and fluoride effectively.
                        Our method makes a great improvement based on current-biological treatments. It is highly efficient, low cost and reduces the secondary pollution.</P><P style="text-align:center">Figure 1. Sewage with excess copper </P><P style="text-align:center">Figure 2.
