Yuanxin Wang
I’m a senior student in biomedical science.  And this is the second year for me to be an iGEMer. Although most of my classes  tells me how to be a good experimentalist, I’m in charge of modelling part in  the team. Most of my work is transforming the biological process into a  mathematical model and doing some data analysis. I enjoy reading and listening  to soft music in my spare time. Besides, I’m always dreaming to have enough  time to paint a picture about the school to memorize the four years I've spent.
