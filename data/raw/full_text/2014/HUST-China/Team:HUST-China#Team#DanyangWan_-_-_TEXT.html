Danyang Wang
I am a junior in bioinformatics. And in  this team, I am a member of wet lab group. I participated in the work of  cyanide part and growth curve. I learnt a lot in the whole year teamwork--a  crazy heart for the project and the hard work for final result. iGEM is a great  platform for us to play with biology. So just imagine ,and you will make it.  Beside this, I love singing.
