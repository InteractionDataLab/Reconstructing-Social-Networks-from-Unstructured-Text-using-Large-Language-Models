detoxify fluoride and  suggest whether the water is safe for further use. With these giant goals, the 
first thing we needed to do is using computational method simulate the biological process and figure   
out whether our design is feasible. We established DDEs (delay differential equations) to see whether our  
instructors are trustable and give some further information for the detective part of our toolkit. Then we tested the robustness and sensitivity to get a broader insight
of biological system both in single cell level and multicellular level. By doing this, we can get their
 properties for better application.</P><H1 align="left">Single Cell Level</H1><H3 align="left">DDEs Simulation</H3><P>There are two kinds of <EM>E. Coli</EM> in the  project— <EM>E. worker</EM> and <EM>E. instructor</EM>. The former ones produce some proteins binding  with copper ions in the polluted water and the latter ones tell us whether the  water is safe enough for further use. Since the thing we care about most is the  safety of the water and the workers will be dedicated to remove the ions in the  water before we decided to let them flow to the following pool, we established some  equations to simulate the biological process of instructors. Considering about  it will take some time for the transcription and translation process before a  protein can bind with some certain promoters, we use DDEs instead of ODEs to  make our simulation closer to the reality. And here are the equations:</P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Table 1:</B> Descriptions and Values of the Parameters.</P><TABLE class="bg" width="80%" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><TBODY><TR><TD>parameter</TD><TD>description</TD><TD>value</TD><TD>reference</TD></TR><TR><TD>copynum</TD><TD>copy number of pACYDuet-1 plasmid</TD><TD>18~22</TD><TD>[1]</TD></TR><TR><TD>trc<SUB>1</SUB></TD><TD>transcription rate of mCII</TD></TR><TR><TD>w/o inducing: 0</TD></TR><THREAD><TR><TD>inducing: 1</TD></TR></THREAD></TBODY></TABLE>[2]deg<SUB>1</SUB>transcription rate of mCII0.12[3]deg<SUB>2</SUB>degradation rate of CII0.1[4]deg<SUB>3</SUB>degradation rate of mCI0.12[3]deg<SUB>4</SUB>degradation rate of CI0.042[4]deg<SUB>5</SUB>degradation rate of mGFP0.13[5]deg<SUB>6</SUB>degradation rate of GFP0.017[6]deg<SUB>7</SUB>degradation rate of mRFP0.13[5]deg<SUB>8</SUB>degradation rate of RFP0.017[6]trl<SUB>1</SUB>translation rate of CII0.12[4]trl<SUB>2</SUB>translation rate of CI0.09[3]trl<SUB>3</SUB>translation rate of GFP5.4[7]trl<SUB>4</SUB>translation rate of RFP5.4[7]V<SUB>max<SUB>1</SUB></SUB>maximum transcription rate when induced by CII protein0.9[4]V<SUB>max<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>maximum transcription rate when induced by CI<SUB>2</SUB>  protein0.66[4]τ<SUB>1</SUB>time for CII transcription, translation and folding0.24minestimated the same as CI<SUB>2</SUB>τ<SUB>2</SUB>time for CI2 transcription, translation and  folding0.24min[3]k<SUB>m<SUB>1</SUB></SUB>apparent association constant for CII binding with pRE  promoter0.398[8]k<SUB>m<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>apparent association constant for CI<SUB>2</SUB>  binding with pR promoter1.58*10<SUP>-3</SUP>[3]k<SUB>1</SUB>reaction constant for CI forming CI<SUB>2</SUB>3[4]k<SUB>2</SUB>reaction constant for CI<SUB>2</SUB> disassociating to  CI30[4]<P>The  results of simulation are shown in the graphs below: </P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Fig.1,2:</B> Simulation Results.</P><P>As you  can notice in the picture, the expression level of fluorescent protein changes a lot from polluted and non-polluted water. Thus, by detecting the  fluorescence intensity of each protein, we can gain the information about  whether the water is safe for further use. Considering about the severe  consequences of taking in excessive amount of copper ions, we should make sure that our  data is credible and the information we get is accurate.</P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Fig.3:</B> The Dealing Process.</P><P>We simulated the whole process of the water-dealing procedure. In the view of that  the transcription rate of the copper sensitive promoter is related to the  concentration of copper in the water, we divided the treating process into  several parts with different transcriptional rate, and combined all the data  eventually to make our simulation closer to the reality. The result showed  below indicates that only detecting one of the fluorescent intensity only is enough  to get the information we want. But we should always detect the other fluorescent intensity  redundantly to make the conclusion more trustable.</P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Fig.4:</B> The Overview Graph of Continuous Dealing Process.</P><H3 align="left">Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis</H3><P>Considering there are so many parameters and variables in the equations, we chose to use numerical  solutions to analyze the robustness of the equations. Since trc<SUB>1</SUB>, τ<SUB>1</SUB> and τ<SUB>2</SUB> are three changeable parameters that may contribute  most to the output, we decided to put our focus on these three  parameters in this part. Here are some graphs representing the expression  states under different trc<SUB>1</SUB> values.</P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Fig.5:</B> The Expression States with Different trc<SUB>1</SUB> Values.</P><P>From  left to right, up to down, the values of  trc<SUB>1</SUB> are: 0, 0.002, 0.005 and 1. These four graphs represent four different stable  states with different trc<SUB>1</SUB> values. Although the final expression levels are  different, they all achieve a stable state. In other words, we can judge  whether the water is safe for further use just by detecting limited numbers of  data.</P><P>Then  we shifted our focus onto the specific parameters. The first thing we did is to  analyze how the expression levels of GFP and RFP are sensitive to the value of trc<SUB>1</SUB>. We changed the value of trc<SUB>1</SUB> from 0 to 0.1 at the step length of 0.001.  The picture shows below is the simulating result.</P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Fig.6:</B> Parameter Sweep.</P><P>As you can see in the picture, the green curve represents the GFP expression condition, and the red one represents that of RFP. The fewer and more scattered the curves are, the faster the final output changes. Based on the picture showed above, we can conclude that the expression of GFP and RFP is not so sensitive to   trc<SUB>1</SUB> with increasing value of it from 0 to 1. When   trc<SUB>1 </SUB>approaches to ∞, the expression level of GFP is close to the black curve while that of RFP is close to the blue one. </P><P>To test the effects of the expression condition on GFP and RFP caused by trc<SUB>1</SUB> a step further, we pictured the fluorescent intensity of GFP and RFP at t equaling 200min (an estimated stable state) under different  trc<SUB>1</SUB> values.</P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Fig.7,8:</B> Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis.</P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Table 2:</B> The Digital Number Changes of GFP and RFP When trc<SUB>1</SUB> Changes At the Step Length of 0.01.</P><TABLE class="bg" width="95%" border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0"><TBODY><TR><TD>trc<SUB>1</SUB>*10<SUP>-2</SUP></TD><TD>[0 1]</TD><TD>[1 2]</TD><TD>[2 3]</TD><TD>[3 4]</TD><TD>[4 5]</TD><TD>[5 6]</TD><TD>[6 7]</TD><TD>[7 8]</TD><TD>[8 9]</TD><TD>[9 10]</TD></TR><TR><TD>GFP</TD><TD>2332.70</TD><TD>11.86</TD><TD>3.33</TD><TD>1.71</TD><TD>1.08</TD><TD>0.76</TD><TD>0.57</TD><TD>0.45</TD><TD>0.36</TD><TD>0.30</TD></TR><TR><TD>RFP</TD><TD>423.87</TD><TD>282.56</TD><TD>201.85</TD><TD>151.43</TD><TD>117.81</TD><TD>94.28</TD><TD>77.16</TD><TD>64.32</TD><TD>54.44</TD><TD>46.68</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>The left picture above shows the fluorescent intensity of GFP and RFP on stable states under different trc<SUB>1</SUB> values, the right one shows the rate of change. The chart above shows the digital number changes of GFP and RFP when trc<SUB>1</SUB> changes at the step length of 0.01. </P><P>According to the data and graphs above, we will find it’s  not hard to make the conclusions below:</P><P>1. The expression level of GFP and RFP is rather sensitive to trc<SUB>1</SUB>, when the value of trc<SUB>1</SUB><SUB>1</SUB> becomes larger, this kind of influence reduces and will finally have no effect on the expression level of GFP and RFP. (In the extreme state)</P><P>2. The influence of trc<SUB>1</SUB> to the expression condition of GFP is short but obvious. When the value of trc<SUB>1</SUB> changes between 0 and 0.01, the change of relative fluorescent intensity of GFP is about 2322. While that of trc<SUB>1</SUB> changes between 0.09 and 0.1, the change of relative fluorescent intensity of GFP is only about 0.3, which is close to 0. In addition, the graph on the right shows that the rate of change of the GFP fluorescent intensity reaches the maximum to   at site A and reduces tremendously to nearly 0.</P><P>3. The influence of trc<SUB>1</SUB> on the expression of RFP is mild but endless. When the value of trc<SUB>1</SUB> changes between 0 and 0.01, the change of relative fluorescent intensity of GFP is about 424. When that of trc<SUB>1</SUB> changes between 0.09 and 0.1, the change of relative fluorescent intensity of RFP is about 47. The fluorescent intensity of RFP is still increasing when the value of trc<SUB>1</SUB> equals 0.1. Actually, this kind of increase will keep on even when the value of trc<SUB>1</SUB> is over 1.</P><P>4.At site 1 on the left graph, the value of trc<SUB>1</SUB> is 0.004, where the fluorescent intensity of GFP and RFP is exactly the same. And at site B on the right graph, the value of trc<SUB>1</SUB> is about 0.0099, where the rate of change of the fluorescent intensity of GFP and RFP is the same. </P><P>Considering  that the treating process is a long-lasting period, during which the  concentration of copper ions changes a lot, the transcription rate varies from time to time. We tested the time that would consume to reach a new stable  state with the change of trc<SUB>1</SUB>.</P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Fig.9:</B> Time Needed to Reach A New Stable State with Different trc<SUB>1</SUB>.</P><P>This picture represents the value of trc<SUB>1</SUB> changing from 0.005 to  0.002. We defined that when the  related error is equal to or less than 5%, it reaches a stable state. So, as you  can see in the picture above, when t equals 373 (site E), the fluorescent  intensity of GFP and RFP are identical. When t equals 554 (site F), the  expression level of RFP reaches the stable state. And when t equals 646 (site G),  the expression level of GFP reaches the stable state.</P><P>The above is what we did to analyze the output sensitivity to trc<SUB>1</SUB>. Then we tested how the parameter τ (time delay) affects the output result. We changed the value of τ from 0.12 to 0.36 at the step length of 0.01 to see the result. </P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Fig.10,11:</B> The Effection of τ to the Output.</P><P>As the picture shown above, the fluorescent intensity of GFP and RFP is  extremely insensitive to the change of τ (time delay). When the parameter τ  (time delay) changes  from 0.12 to 0.36, the fluorescent intensity of GFP in the stable state only changes  at the value of 5.28, while that of RFP only changes at the value of 2.23. </P><H3 align="left">Circuit Improvement</H3><P>As mentioned above, that our system is  rather sensitive to the concentration of copper ions. However, the detected results may  fail to tell what the concentration of cooper ions is exactly. If the basic  transcriptional level of the promoter is higher than 0.005, the expression  level of RFP is always comparatively much higher than that of GFP. Unfortunately,  according to the results from our wet lab, the promoter we chose at the first  time has a quit severe leakage. Thus we will have no idea about whether the  water is safe enough for further use by detecting the fluorescent intensity. Since  it’s the expression level of RFP that is higher than our expectations, we tried to  reduce it by improving our gene circuits. According to our designing, it’s CII  protein that induces the expression of RFP. So we believe that adding a degradation  tag may be a good solution. Then we tested how many times of the original  degradation rate is needed. And here is the result of the transcription rate where the water is safe according to the national standard. Considering  about that there are always some oscillations of parameters in the biological  system, we also did a gradient analysis to see whether these oscillations may  affect the result and whether there are any superior choices. </P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Fig.12,13:</B> Circuit Improvement.</P><P>As you can see in the picture above, a  specific times of the degradation rate is required. However, there is no much room for parameter oscillations. Since the degradation rate cannot be predicted  accurately <EM>in vivo</EM>, especially when  some tags are added (the accelerated degradation rate largely depends on the  proteins inside cells), we tried to find some other promoters that are more  suitable for our project. </P><P>Luckily, we found the <EM>PpcoA</EM> promoter. As  you can see in the graph below, there is no significant difference in the  relative fluorescent intensity between the pET28a plasmids containing and not  containing the <EM>PpcoA</EM> promoter. So it can be predicted that the transcription  rate of this promoter can meet our need.</P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Fig.14:</B> Promoter Test.</P><H1 id="h2_2" align="left">Multicelluar Level</H1><H3 align="left">Environmental factors</H3><P>Since the wastewater we tried to deal with come from the  process of industrial producing, we must consider some environmental factors  that can affect the treatment procedure. There are also some other ions in the water  that can form some chelate  compounds combining with copper ions. And these ions have a competitive  relationship with copper-binding proteins. By analyzing the whole environmental  surroundings, we can get the information about how many copper-binding proteins we need, thus to calculate how many bacteria we should paint on  the surface of the RBC (Rotating Biological Contactor). According to previous literature review, we found the major existing forms of copper ions in  the wastewater from industries are [Cu(CN)3]<SUP>2-</SUP> and [Cu(NH3)4]<SUP>2+</SUP>.  There are 4 major reactions occur in the water, and here are the equations.</P><P>After looking up some papers, we found the concentration of [Cu(CN)<SUB>3</SUB>]<SUP>2-</SUP> is estimated to be 50mg/L<SUP>[9]</SUP> and that of [Cu(NH3)4]<SUP>2+</SUP>/ is about 20.55mM<SUP>[10]</SUP> in industrial wastewater. Since our  <EM>E. Kungfu</EM> can also oxidize cyanide, CN<SUP>-</SUP> can be removed from the  water, moving the balance of the process towards the direction in favor of  degrading [Cu(CN)<SUB>3</SUB>]<SUP>2-</SUP>. Thus, most of [Cu(CN)<SUB>3</SUB>]<SUP>2-</SUP>  will be transformed into Cu<SUP>+</SUP>. Then disproportionation reaction  occurs, all Cu<SUP>+</SUP> will be transformed into either Cu or Cu<SUP>2+</SUP>.  As for [Cu(NH<SUB>3</SUB>)4]<SUP>2+</SUP>, since one of the  degradation products is NH<SUB>3</SUB>, which is a kind of gas that will be  released from water, the balance of the process will also move towards the  direction in favor of degradation. So the number of CBP we need is just the  exact amount of copper ions that we try to remove from the wastewater. (The apparent  dissociation constants for Cu(I)-binding proteins and ligands of low-mass are all about 10<SUP>15</SUP> and we will constantly remove bacteria containing CBPs  from the wastewater. So, we assumed that all the copper ions can be adsorbed by these copper binding proteins.) According to the data mentioned above, the number of CBPs we need to make wastewater meet the national  standard is about 3.09*10<SUP>21</SUP>. By estimating how many copper binding  proteins an <EM>E. Coli</EM> can bear, we can gain the data of the number of <EM>E. Kungfu</EM> we  need to plant onto the rotating disks. And by combining with the diameter of the  rotating disk, we can know how thick of the cultural medium should be needed  to fixate enough <EM>E. worker</EM>. </P><H3 align="left">RBC Toolkit</H3><P>We also planned to optimize some parameters of the rotating biological contactors (RBC) to achieve the best function. Although some articles claimed that increase the speed of the rotating disks can make the whole dealing system more efficient. We must consider that with the increase of the speed, the enormous energy consumption and the burden of spindle will be a big problem. This is why we should choose a suitable speed before we put our idea into application. The equations below describe the relationship between some critical parameters, according to which we can adjust the rotating speed. </P><P style="text-align:center"><B>Table 3:</B> Parameter Descriptions</P><TABLE class="bg" width="80%" border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><TBODY><TR><TD>parameter</TD><TD>description</TD><TD>unit</TD></TR><TR><TD>A</TD><TD>the overall area of rotating disks</TD><TD>m<SUP>2</SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD>Q</TD><TD>the volume of the  sewage needed to be treated </TD><TD>m<SUP>3</SUP>/d</TD></TR><TR><TD>S<SUB>0</SUB></TD><TD>the  BOD<SUB>5</SUB> value in the  sewage</TD><TD>mg/L</TD></TR><TR><TD>L<SUB>A</SUB></TD><TD>the BOD<SUB>5</SUB>  consuming by bacteria per square meter, per day</TD><TD>g/(m<SUP>2</SUP>d)</TD></TR><TR><TD>m</TD><TD>the pieces of the rotating disks</TD><TD>piece</TD></TR><TR><TD>D</TD><TD>the diameter of the rotating disks</TD><TD>m</TD></TR><TR><TD>L</TD><TD>the effective length of the tank</TD><TD>m</TD></TR><TR><TD>a</TD><TD>the net space between  contiguous disks</TD><TD>m</TD></TR><TR><TD>b</TD><TD>the thickness of the rotating disks</TD><TD>m</TD></TR><TR><TD>K</TD><TD>coefficient</TD><TD>/</TD></TR><TR><TD>V<SUB>1</SUB></TD><TD>net effective volume</TD><TD>m<SUP>3</SUP></TD></TR><TR><TD>δ</TD><TD>coefficient</TD><TD>m</TD></TR><TR><TD>n<SUB>0</SUB></TD><TD>rotating speed</TD><TD>r/min</TD></TR><TR><TD>Q<SUB>1</SUB></TD><TD>the setting volume of the tank</TD><TD>m<SUP>3</SUP>/d</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Since we cannot get most values of the parameters in real conditions, we failed to specify these equations in the form of some graphs.
