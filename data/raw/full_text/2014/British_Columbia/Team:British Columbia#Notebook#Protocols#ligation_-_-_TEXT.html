BioBrick Ligation
Supplies:
T4 DNA ligase
Ligase buffer
dH2O
Insert and vector
Steps:
Get ice.
Put the reagents on ice.
Calculate insert vector amount. Add the calculated amounts into eppendorf tube.
*Formula 1: insert mass(ng) = (1/6) x (insert length/vector length) x vector mass (ng)
*Formula 2: volume of insert(µL) = (total plasmid length/ insert length) x (insert mass/plasmid concentration)
Make a reaction mix with everything but the insert.
Aliquot the master mix into eppendorf tubes.
Add insert DNA.
Let incubate at room temperalerature for at least 2h or overnight.
