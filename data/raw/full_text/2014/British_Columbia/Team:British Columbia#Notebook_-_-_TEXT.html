=='''June 27'''== ===Transformation of parts BBa_K801070, BBa_K801071, BBa_K801072 (2013 Kit, Plate 2, Wells 17H, 17J, 17L)=== '''Experimenters''': Grace Yi, Liz Geum
'''Aim''': To transform the TU Munich caffeine biosynthesis BioBricks from the Distribution Kit into E. coli chemically competent cells. This was also to test the cells' competency.
'''Results''': Eluted DNA from wells 17H, 17J, and 17L on plate 2 were transformed via heat-shock into the chemically competent cells made earlier. These were plated on LB agar/chloramphenicol plates and incubated overnight at 37 ºC. Transformation efficiency was found to be very low - two colonies per plate after more than 18 hours at 37 ºC.

You should make use of the calendar feature on the wiki and start a lab notebook. This may be looked at by the judges to see how your work progressed throughout the summer. It is a very useful organizational tool as well.
