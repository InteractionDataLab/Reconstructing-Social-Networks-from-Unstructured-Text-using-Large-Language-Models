Electrocompetent Cell Production
Day 1
Streak out frozen glycerol stock of bacterial cells (Top 10, DH5α, etc.) onto an LB plate without antibiotics.
Grow plate overnight at 37°C.
Day 2
Autoclave:
2 L of ddH2O
100 mL of 10% v/v glycerol (molecular biology grade)
1 L of LB (or preferred media)
4 centrifuge bottles and caps
few microfuge tubes
Chill overnight at 4°C:
ddH2O
10% glycerol.
centrifuge rotor.
Prepare starter culture of cells.
Select a single colony of E. coli from fresh LB plate and inoculate a 10 mL starter culture of LB (or preferred media).
Grow culture at 37°C in shaker overnight.
Possible media substitutes include SOB, 2xYT, etc.
All glassware should be detergent-free, as trace detergent residue reduces competency.
Day 3
Inoculate 1 L of LB media with 10 mL starter culture and grow in a 37°C shaker. Measure the OD600 every hour, then every 15 - 20 minutes when the OD gets above 0.2.
When the OD600 reaches 0.35 - 0.4, immediately put the cells on ice. Chill the culture for 20 - 30 minutes, swirling occasionally to ensure even cooling.
Place centrifuge bottles on ice at this time:
It is important not to let the OD get any higher than 0.4. It usually takes about 3 hours to reach an OD of 0.35 when using a 10 mL starter culture.
It is also very important to keep the cells at 4°C for the remainder of the procedure. The cells, and any bottles or solutions that they come into contact with, must be pre-chilled to 4°C.
(SPIN #1) Split the 1 L culture into four parts by pouring about 250 mL into ice-cold centrifuge bottles. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000g (~2400 rpm in the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 20 minutes at 4°C.
Decant the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 200 mL of ice-cold ddH2O.
(SPIN #2) Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000g (~2400 rpm in the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 20 minutes at 4°C.
Decant the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 100 mL of ice-cold ddH2O.
(SPIN #3)Combine resuspensions into 2 centrifuge bottles (so each contains about 200 mL of cell suspension). Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000g (~2400 rpm in the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 20 minutes at 4°C. At this step, rinse two 50 mL conical tubes with ddH2O and chill on ice.
Decant the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 40 mL of ice-cold 10% glycerol. Transfer each suspension to a 50 mL conical tube.
Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000g (~2100 rpm in the Beckman GH-3.8 rotor) for 20 minutes at 4°C. Start putting 1.5 mL microfuge tubes on ice if not already chilled.
Carefully aspirate the supernatant with a sterile Pasteur pipette (pellets lose adherence in 10% glycerol). Resuspend each pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold 10% glycerol by gently swirling. The final OD600 of the resuspended cells should be ~ 200 - 250.
Aliquot into sterile 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and snap freeze with liquid nitrogen. Store frozen cells in the -80°C freezer.
