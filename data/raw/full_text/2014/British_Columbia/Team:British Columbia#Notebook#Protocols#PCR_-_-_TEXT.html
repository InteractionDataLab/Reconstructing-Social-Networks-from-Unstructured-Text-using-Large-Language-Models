Colony PCR
Supplies needed:
PCR tubes
BioBrick PCR primers (VF2, VR)
Taq polymerase
10x Reaction Buffer
10mM dNTPs
dH2O
Steps:
Make master mix of PCR components except the DNA. Keep on ice.
N=number of samples
*Add about extra amount worth two samples to account for water control and pipetting error. (if regular PCR is done use ca.50-200ng template DNA and use Phusion and 10x Phusion buffer instead of Taq)
Aliquot 25µL per PCR tube, keep tubes on ice.
*Following steps must be done near the flame*
Touch toothpick/ pipet tip/ loop tp colony, then index plates, then dip in the PCR tube.
*Turn of flame*
Run PCR:
Turn machine on
Load samples in machine
Select appropriate temperatures and times
95°C for 10s
94°C for 30s
60°C for 30s
68°C for 1min per kb of expected product (round up)
Repeat 2-4 30times
68°C for 20 mins
4°C forever
Once finished, remove the PCR tubes from the machine.
Verify PCR products agerose gel or store PCR tubes at 4°C or -20°C.
