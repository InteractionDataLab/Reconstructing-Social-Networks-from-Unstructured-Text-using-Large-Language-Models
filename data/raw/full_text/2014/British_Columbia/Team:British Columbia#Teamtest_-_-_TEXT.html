Adam Ziada
Major and Year:
Microbiology and Immunology
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year because I thought it sounded like a lot of fun! I love exploring the unknown, and coming up with wild ideas that might just work. That's what drew me to iGEM, the idea that we really might be able to come up with something crazy and get it to work. That's why I joined iGEM!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I was actually hoping to meet a bunch of awesome and nerdy people who shared my interest in molecular and synthetic biology. I'd say that was a success.
What inspires you:
The infinite. People have always talked about limitations. How things can't be done, how they are impossible. I think the impossible, the unobtainable, has always been more of a challenge, something I aspire to. Like a sweet aroma it calls me, always has and always will. One day, I want meet the impossible, the infinite, the endless.
Hobbies:
Well right now I'm learning ballroom dancing! It's actually a ton of fun!!! :D

Albertina Wong
Major and Year:
Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology, Graduated May 2014
Why iGEM:
I had wanted to join iGEM ever since they've promoted it in one of my first year biology classes. Being in Computer Science and Microbiology, I find the ideas of applying engineering principles (ie. reusability, modularization) onto the 'messy' biological systems fascinating. I feel that iGEM is a rare opportunity, especially for undergraduate students, to get to put together a project of their own design and presenting it internationally.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to better and refine my modelling skills and knowledge from participating in iGEM and if possible to get to touch a bit of wet lab as well.
What inspires you:
The possibility of alternate realities inspires me and in a way I see research as a means that could bridge us from our present state to one of these realities. It is an incredible privilege to be able to entertain our imagination through practical means of testing and experimentation and of those rare moments when we can reap results from it, there are many thanks to give.
Desired Impact on the World:
It would be an exciting realm to be in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Public Health and be able to contribute in that area.
Hobbies:
I enjoy reading the National Geographics, New York Times and every now and then, the Sanger Blog.

Anna Muller
Major and Year:
Honors Microbiology and Immunology 4th Year
Why iGEM:
I first heard about iGEM when I was in high school and ever since I wanted to be part of it, for me this is a very exciting opportunity. I first joined the team last year and I enjoyed it so much I decided to return. I can’t wait to make some awesome bacteria! I moved to Canada two years ago from Germany. Now I am really enjoying Vancouver.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to play a bigger role in designing the constructs and systems for our project this year. In addition I hope to improve my public speaking skills and learn even more about the creative applications of microbes through this years Giant Jamboree!
What inspires you:
I love bacteria and all sorts of Microbes but aside from microbiology I am interested in marine biology. Through scuba diving, my favourite destination being Egypt, I fell in love with the beautiful underwater world.
Desired Impact on the World:
I love research and I want to pursue a career in science, what that will look like and where I will be is a mystery right now but I’m sure it will all work out.
Hobbies:
My favourite thing to do here is skiing in winter; I can’t wait for next season. On campus you can find me either in the lab, at the gallery, or at the pool napping. But if there is something you should know about me is that I love travelling and living in different places around the world, so this is definitely not my last stop.

Ariel Ragetli
Major and Year:
Major in Biochemistry (3rd Year)
Why iGEM:
I heard about iGEM from my second year Biochemistry teaching assistant who told me about past project ideas and the basic design of the program. I was intrigued by the idea of creating machines, little bacteria, that could solve complex problems.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to refine my laboratory technique and get the opportunity to work with people vastly more knowledgeable in the world of research and synthetic biology to expand my own knowledge base as well as get the chance to help create something tangible that could potentially have some impact on the world around us.
Desired Impact on the World:
I have always wanted to solve a complex problem, in the context of human diseases, and to physically see the impact of that solution on the people affected.
Hobbies:
Learning Japanese, I have been to Japan twice in my life and am intrigued by the culture and the language. I plan on spending an extended period of time in Japan at one point in my life, and I am continuously practicing and improving my conversational to that end .

Daniel Korvin
Major And Year:
Microbiology and Immunology with a Minor in Biochemistry Graduated May 2014
Why iGEM:
I first heard of iGEM through a friend back in 2009. At the the time, I thought he was crazy. 'E. Coli cultures lighting up like traffic lights!?'. Two years later, in 2011, I stumbled across the openwetware wiki while doing research for a project, and this led me to the iGEM page. After seeing the kinds of incredible projects that had been attempted over the years, I was hooked, and knew that I had to join the UBC team at the next available opportunity.
Hope to gain from iGEM:
I hope to improve my understanding of engineering principals in biology and build on my modelling knowledge base, these tools will help me work towards a masters degree in chemical and biological engineering.
What Inspires you:
Everything to do with microbes, especially the application of metabolic engineering to microbes, ask my team mates about chicken sexing or electrobacter and they will tell you!
Hobbies:
My interests include growing and showing off stylish goatees, hiking, and discussing new applications for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.

Eric Stroczynski
Major and Year:
Microbiology and Immunology 3rd Year
Why iGEM:
The first time I herd about iGEM was though a friend who attended one of the information sessions from the year before, I was curious so I decided to check it out.  I was astonished with the creativity, freedom, and quality of the projects and I told myself that I need to be a part of this experience
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I would love to work on my wet lab skills and learn the in’s and out’s of designing biological systems. Since this is my first experience with iGEM and synthetic biology I am excited to soak in as much information as I can.
What inspires you:
To put it simply, good music, good friends, and good cheer.
Desired Impact on the World:
I think microbes are fascinating and for the time being I see myself transforming the world through creative research. But who knows, I’m sure iGEM will allow me to open my mind to new possibilities within science, business, and policy alike.
Hobbies:
I love beer, craft beer to be precise, and I love to share it with friends.

Fisal Elstone
Major and Year:
Integrated Sciences, Graduated May 2014!
Why iGEM:
I joined IGEM last year because it remains a unique undergraduate experience that forces teams of students try to solve problems in a multidimensional, collaborative manner. This multidimensional approach seems reflective of how problems are solved in the working world and there are few opportunities to work on projects like this in an undergraduate degree. I was also drawn in by the incredible imagination and success of past teams! Needless to say, I really enjoyed the IGEM experience and hence I decided to return.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to gain an appreciation and a broader sense of what is possible as a undergrad in todays scientific community. From the project itself I hope to improve my wetlab skills as well as gain more exposure to the academic/industry interface.
What inspires you:
Honestly IGEM really inspires me; it’s quite remarkable to see passionate young scientists working towards ambitious projects and collaborating with other students from around the globe. I am a big fan of the Jamboree in particular.
Desired Impact on the World:
I have always wanted to help people and to this day it remains the strongest indicator of what I want to do. I think the intersection between clinical research and medicine would be a fascinating realm to enter.
Hobbies:
I try to spend as much time outside as I can be it Skiing, Climbing, or Backpacking; on quiet days its netflix and boardgames.

Jacky Chan
Major and Year:
5th Year Engineering Physics
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year. I first learned about it from Engineering Student Newsletter as a fellow Engineering Physics student gave his account of being in iGEM. At this point I was already aiming to specialize in engineering with medical or a biological application making iGEM the perfect way to extend my experience into biology. Furthermore iGEM was a rare chance to broaden my scope and meet non-engineers.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to gain experience in wet lab and gain a better understanding of what it means to engineer organisms.
What inspires you:
Technology and science is like magic when you don't understand it. But like all good magic, once you know the trick to it, it becomes your's to use.
Desired Impact on the World:
Contributing to the medical field.
Hobbies:
Cycling and photography.

Jeffrey Pea
Major and Year:
Microbiology and Immunology (2nd Year)
Why iGEM:
Having just joined this year, I heard about iGEM throughout my first year but was not exactly sure what it was. However, after going to several introductory meetings I was immediately hooked by passionate and knowledgeable everyone was on the team. The realm of synthetic biology seemed truly fascinating, for it was a field I wasn't very familiar with and yet very curious about. Soon, I began to realize that iGEM provided an outlet for me to be exploratory and innovative in research, using the fundamental knowledge I learned previously and implementing them in novel experiments. The combination of being able to apply my learning in a laboratory setting, being able to learn more advanced techniques related my background, and being able to immerse myself in an exponentially growing field that is synthetic biology is the main reasoning for joining the iGEM team.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
By being a part of iGEM, I hope to become a more well-rounded scientist and researcher. My goal is to become more knowledgeable in the field of synthetic biology, whether that is through reading background content or applying lab techniques. That way, I can contribute more to the team in the future as well as apply what I have learned to other similar experiences down the road.
What inspires you:
What has really driven me throughout my life has been the dynamic between the natural curiosity humans have towards the unknown and the ability to share the discoveries stemmed from that interest to society. It is fascinating to see how driven humanity can be to venture into the unknown, risking everything for the sake of obtaining knowledge. What fascinates me further is how captivated these scientists are in explaining these findings to everyone else so that all can benefit from the newfound information. This process is one that I believe makes humanity very special and gifted and one that drives me to do my part to help.
Desired Impact on the World:
Humanitarian aid has always been a passion of mine, especially with it came to investigating the various public health concerns around the world. I would love to be an integral part of research pivotal in improving the health of communities currently lacking in accessible healthcare. Whether this is through drug discovery or disease control, it would be fantastic to contribute to work that leads to aiding others.
Hobbies:
When I am not working on iGEM, I am often outside playing sports or supporting my favorite sport teams. In particular, I am an avid soccer fan, passionately supporting the clubs Tottenham Hotspurs and San Jose Earthquakes. In exploration of my more artistic side, I frequently spend my time painting and learning new languages.

Joe Ho
Major and Year:
Integrated Sciences Graduated January 2014
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM because of a Terry Talk by a past iGEM member, who described the elegance of synthetic biology and the need to create standardized parts. That moment on, I was hooked into iGEM and its limitless potential.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I have been with iGEM for several years now and every year I love being able to take a concept and try to turn it into something tangible, useful, and meaningful; it truly is a unique undergraduate experience. The jamboree is one of my favourite parts of iGEM, its inspiring to see all the different projects and hear what inspired other teams.
What inspires you:
Nature, its incredible complexity juxtaposed with its elegant simplicity is just mind blowing. I see nature and its application as being as limitless as the imagination itself.
Desired Impact on the World:
I live and breathe science, ask mike, and I see myself having a long enjoyable life pondering synthetic systems in microbes, or probing the pathophysiology and treatments of human diseases.
Hobbies:
Outside from lab work and reading "binders full of journal articles", I enjoy watching hockey and maintaining my vegetable garden. Occasionally, I enjoy swimming and hiking.

Joel Kumlin
Major and Year:
Chemical Engineering w. Minor in Honours Mathematics
Why iGEM:
2013 - I wanted to learn some biological engineering practices as well as create some worthwhile biological models.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I joined iGEM last year to get more experience with creating models to describe real-world phenomena, this year I am hoping to transfer some skills in modeling and numerical methods to the newer members so that UBC can continue to build award winning models.
What inspires you:
There are so many unfinished. untried, non-optimized systems that can be improved on in this world. The more I learn the more inefficiencies I see.  I get inspired by people thinking of new ways to deal with these inefficiencies and get excited coming up with elegant solutions to these problems. There is so much work to do on this world, I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to retire!
Desired impact on the world:
I'm interested in advancing technology, various technologies can be better understood when implementing the language of mathematics. As much as we'd like to think differently, most engineering is still done with "opinion-based" decision making. There are chemical and biological fields where the mathematics has not been reduced to a low enough form to become useful for most engineers - moving to "science-based" or "math-based" decision making can reduce inefficiencies that cost time, money and energy. And I would like to be a part of applying practical mathematics to real world problems.
Hobbies:
When not in labs, or staring at excited liquid crystals - I like hitting the ball long on golf courses and running down shots on the tennis court.

Melody Lu
Major and Year:
Medical Laboratory Science, 4th year
Why iGEM:
I just joined iGEM this year and actually I only just heard of iGEM this year. I have been working in a research lab for more than a year. Different from the conventional undergraduate research experience, the cool thing about iGEM is that it is totally student run and we have people who major in different fields in science and even engineering! As an undergrad who has always been working and studying with people in my own major, I really look forward to working with these people coming from various disciplines and coming up with something amazing!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to explore the various parts of iGEM. IGEM is not just about designing and carrying out an experiment and presenting the result in the end. We also need to think about the practical aspects of the project: the funding, the feasibility and the social impact, etc. I hope at the end of iGEM, I can gain an insight into scientific research in general.
What inspires you:
The power of research. Research keeps pushing the limits between what we know and the unknown. The findings can be totally unpredicted sometimes and it can also shock the world.
Desired impact on the world:
I want to become a health professional and help out people in my community. And if possible in the future, I also wish to become a WHO agent and save the people who cannot afford the basic medical needs.
Hobbies:
Like many Asians, I go play badminton. I also enjoy ballroom dancing and swimming.

Negin Tousi
Major and Year:
Fourth year in Chemical and Biological Engineering
Why iGEM:
Having heard about iGEM from a former team member in my program, I joined the team in 2013. My interest in bioprocess engineering and genetics combined with my desire to find novel solutions to real world problems drove me to apply to UBC iGEM. Needless to say, I enjoyed the experience of iGEM so much that I decided to come back for the 2014 team!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
Through iGEM, i hope to better realize the true scale of possibilities in synthetic biology and its true value in our everyday life! I also hope to gain a better understanding of the integration of science in society and develop skills to address these issues.
What inspires you:
"We were not put on this earth to be unremarkable, unimportant, or unnoticed. Make sure you live a life less ordinary." Every individuals participating in iGEM lives by these words and I have never been as inspired as I was at the iGEM World Championships in Boston last year!
What impact do you want to have on the world:
I would love to pursue a career in bioprocess engineering using synthetic biology to produce biofuels!
Hobbies:
I am an adrenaline-junkie at heart and love activities that get my heart pumping: from hiking to skydiving, I'm always looking for a new adventure!

Philip Lam
Major and Year:
4th Year Applied Biology, specializing in Plant and Soil Sciences
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year in order to appreciate the unlimited tamed potentials of anthropogenic biodiversity; it’s my favourite dynamic-and-renewable resource to exploit/domesticate/sustain.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
Initially, I had merely hoped to learn how to transform brewer’s yeast to produce terpenes and polyketides of plant origin, just for the power-trip. Eventually, I decided to stay for the annual Albertan roadtrip of friendship.
What inspires you:
Plant chemicals, fungal and bacterial metabolism, and animal consciousness.  People like Paul Stamets, Alexander Shulgin, Francis Crick, Kary Mullis, Aldous Huxley, Paul Kroeger, George Abbas.
Desired Impact on the world:
I wish to honour my ancestors.
Hobbies:
Watching Youtube reruns of Fear Factor, while getting shunned for watching it.

Tudor Lapuste
Major and Year:
Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology
Why iGEM:
I've been fascinated by topics in synthetic biology ever since I saw a TED talk in 2010 where Craig Venter revealed the "first fully functioning, reproducing cell controlled by synthetic DNA". I've tried to join various synthetic biology efforts since then, including the DIYbio group here in Vancouver, and when I saw that iGEM was accepting new team members, it was a no-brainer!
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to get my hands dirty (not literally of course, I'll be wearing gloves) in the lab and figure out the best way to present information on our team wiki.
What inspires you:
My main inspiration is this idea that technology is bootstrapping on itself and accelerating towards what Ray Kurzweil calls The Singularity. I am a positive person, and as such I see this resulting in a world of abundance, rather than a Terminator-esque dystopia where the machines take over. Radical abundance for all!
Desired impact on the world:
Currently I am planning/am actively pursuing entrepreneurship, and my mission statement reads as "creating a better world through good design". What do you do with your spare time: I am an avid non-fiction reader, and as such I enjoy discussing biotechnology, artificial intelligence, design, and philosophy with my friends. I am also known to be found coding at odd hours.

Wenchen Zhao
Major and Year:
Honours in Biotechnology program
Why iGEM:
This is my first year being an iGEM team member. I joined iGEM because I am very interested in synthetic biology field. It is a very creative and amazing field where you can design your own biological machine and make it beneficial to human beings. Also, I think this is a valuable opportunity to be involved in team work and making progress together with a common goal in our mind.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to gain more knowledge about synthetic biology field and practice my wet lab skills.
What inspires you:
The various possibilities of ways to construct a genetically engineered machine inspire me a lot to participate in this competition. Troubleshooting and figuring out what is going wrong in our design never fail to attract me either.
Desired impact on the world:
In the future, I want to participate and make a positive impact in a biotech company related to cancer or pharmacology. I also look forward to develop myself in leadership areas through experience and training offered by the company.
Hobbies:
I enjoy playing the piano, watching American dramas.

Zeki Ekmekci
Major and Year:
Combined Computer Science and Microbiology and Immunology, going into 2nd year
Why iGEM:
I joined iGEM this year. As soon as I decided to attend UBC, I did some research about the ways I can be involved with research. I found about iGEM team and contacted the team. I attended the team selection meetings the following term, was interviewed and selected! iGEM is a rare and great opportunity to connect with people in the community. I also like the fact that team is consisted of students from different backgrounds such as engineering and computer science. I see great potential in the idea of applying computation and engineering to biological concepts.
Hopes to gain from iGEM:
I hope to get the essential wetlab skills for my major and also get started on the modelling and the other computational aspects of microbiology and immunology. I also want to connect with other scientists in UBC and get to know UBC faculty and students.
What inspires you:
I am very inspired by the scientists that combine their information on different fields and solve big problems. I like the fact that by looking from different perspectives or approaching a problem in an entirely new way, it is possible to derive solutions- solutions that wouldn't possibly be solved  with the cumulative knowledge on one specific field. This makes me think that there is no challenge or problem that cannot be solved.
Desired impact on the world:
I want to create cures and drugs for autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases by not only using laboratory skills but also computer generated modeling.
Hobbies:
I appreciate every aspect of music. I like improving my classical music skills and participate in classical music activities such as performing Beethoven's 9th with Vancouver Symphony Orchestra as a member of UBC Choral Union. I also like spending time on Youtube and finding out news/improvements around the globe.
