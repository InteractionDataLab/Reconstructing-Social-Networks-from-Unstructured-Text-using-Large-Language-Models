Safety
We submitted our About our Lab form on July 21 2014, safety form on September 1, 2014 and these were approved!
Our Training
All of our team members took the basic laboratory courses offered by UBC Risk Management, in accordance with our institutional training requirements . This course covers topics such as WHMIS, biohazards, hazardous chemicals and radioactive material.
All work was done within the institutional biosafety guidelines , which were developed to meet the Canadian Biosafety Standards
Our Organisms and Parts
We only used common BSL1 laboratory strains as our chassis organisms - E. coli and Caulobacter crescentus - and parts derived either from from BSL1 organisms - T7 phage - or are synthetic small peptides.
