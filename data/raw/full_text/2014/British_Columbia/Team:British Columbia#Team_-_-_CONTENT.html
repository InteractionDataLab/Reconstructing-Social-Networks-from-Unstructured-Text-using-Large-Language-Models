Being in Computer Science and Microbiology, I find the ideas of applying engineering principles (ie. reusability, modularization) onto the 'messy' biological systems fascinating.

This multidimensional approach seems reflective of how problems are solved in the working world and there are few opportunities to work on projects like this in an undergraduate degree. I was also drawn in by the incredible imagination and success of past teams! Needless to say, I really enjoyed the IGEM experience and hence I decided to return.
</DD><DT> Hopes to gain from iGEM: </DT><DD>I hope to gain an appreciation and a broader sense of what is possible as a undergrad in todays scientific community.

However, after going to several introductory meetings I was immediately hooked by passionate and knowledgeable everyone was on the team. The realm of synthetic biology seemed truly fascinating, for it was a field I wasn't very familiar with and yet very curious about. Soon, I began to realize that iGEM provided an outlet for me to be exploratory and innovative in research, using the fundamental knowledge I learned previously and implementing them in novel experiments. The combination of being able to apply my learning in a laboratory setting, being able to learn more advanced techniques related my background, and being able to immerse myself in an exponentially growing field that is synthetic biology is the main reasoning for joining the iGEM team. 
</DD><DT>Hopes to gain from iGEM:</DT><DD>By being a part of iGEM, I hope to become a more well-rounded scientist and researcher. My goal is to become more knowledgeable in the field of synthetic biology, whether that is through reading background content or applying lab techniques. That way, I can contribute more to the team in the future as well as apply what I have learned to other similar experiences down the road. 
</DD><DT>What inspires you: </DT><DD>What has really driven me throughout my life has been the dynamic between the natural curiosity humans have towards the unknown and the ability to share the discoveries stemmed from that interest to society. It is fascinating to see how driven humanity can be to venture into the unknown, risking everything for the sake of obtaining knowledge. What fascinates me further is how captivated these scientists are in explaining these findings to everyone else so that all can benefit from the newfound information. This process is one that I believe makes humanity very special and gifted and one that drives me to do my part to help. </DD><DT>Desired Impact on the World:</DT><DD>Humanitarian aid has always been a passion of mine, especially with it came to investigating the various public health concerns around the world. I would love to be an integral part of research pivotal in improving the health of communities currently lacking in accessible healthcare. Whether this is through drug discovery or disease control, it would be fantastic to contribute to work that leads to aiding others.</DD><DT>Hobbies: </DT><DD>When I am not working on iGEM, I am often outside playing sports or supporting my favorite sport teams. In particular, I am an avid soccer fan, passionately supporting the clubs Tottenham Hotspurs and San Jose Earthquakes. In exploration of my more artistic side, I frequently spend my time painting and learning new languages. </DD></DL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="modal fade" id="joe_h" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><DIV class="modal-dialog"><DIV class="modal-content"><DIV class="modal-header"><BUTTON type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true" id="closeModal">×</BUTTON><H4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Joe Ho</H4></DIV><DIV class="modal-body"><DL class="dl-horizontal"><DT>Major and Year:</DT><DD>Integrated Sciences Graduated January 2014</DD><DT>Why iGEM:</DT><DD>I joined iGEM because of a Terry Talk by a past iGEM member, who described the elegance of synthetic biology and the need to create standardized parts.

As much as we'd like to think differently, most engineering is still done with &quot;opinion-based&quot; decision making. There are chemical and biological fields where the mathematics has not been reduced to a low enough form to become useful for most engineers - moving to &quot;science-based&quot; or &quot;math-based&quot; decision making can reduce inefficiencies that cost time, money and energy. And I would like to be a part of applying practical mathematics to real world problems.</DD><DT>Hobbies:</DT><DD> When not in labs, or staring at excited liquid crystals - I like hitting the ball long on golf courses and running down shots on the tennis court.</DD></DL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="modal fade" id="melody_l" role="dialog" aria-hidden="true"><DIV class="modal-dialog"><DIV class="modal-content"><DIV class="modal-header"><BUTTON type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true" id="closeModal">×</BUTTON><H4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Melody Lu</H4></DIV><DIV class="modal-body"><DL class="dl-horizontal"><DT>Major and Year: </DT><DD>Medical Laboratory Science, 4th year</DD><DT>Why iGEM: </DT><DD>I just joined iGEM this year and actually I only just heard of iGEM this year. I have been working in a research lab for more than a year. Different from the conventional undergraduate research experience, the cool thing about iGEM is that it is totally student run and we have people who major in different fields in science and even engineering! As an undergrad who has always been working and studying with people in my own major, I really look forward to working with these people coming from various disciplines and coming up with something amazing!</DD><DT>Hopes to gain from iGEM: </DT><DD>I hope to explore the various parts of iGEM. IGEM is not just about designing and carrying out an experiment and presenting the result in the end. We also need to think about the practical aspects of the project: the funding, the feasibility and the social impact, etc. I hope at the end of iGEM, I can gain an insight into scientific research in general.</DD><DT>What inspires you: </DT><DD>The power of research. Research keeps pushing the limits between what we know and the unknown. The findings can be totally unpredicted sometimes and it can also shock the world.</DD><DT>Desired impact on the world: </DT><DD>I want to become a health professional and help out people in my community.
