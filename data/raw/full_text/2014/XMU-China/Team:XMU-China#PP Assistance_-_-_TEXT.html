We co-found Newsletter with Paris Bettencourt University for the communication convenience of all the iGEMers around the world.
 
And we sent the biobrick BBa_I13507 to Nanjing University for their experiment.
 
Besides, we help the Paris Bettencourt iGEM team in annotating their MOOC, an online tool for high schools who want to compete in the iGEM High School Jamboree. We are glad to make this tool available and usable for high school students.
We helped HFUT_China and Jilin-China with their wiki. HFUT_China offered us their software. We tested it give them some advice.
