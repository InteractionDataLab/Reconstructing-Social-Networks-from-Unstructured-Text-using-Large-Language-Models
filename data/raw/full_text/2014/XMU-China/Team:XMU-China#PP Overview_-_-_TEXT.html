OVERVIEW
 
This year marks the 10th anniversary of iGEM. The decade witnesses the progress and boom of iGEM—more teams sign up for the competition and more programs of high quality are produced. Meanwhile, it is a trend which the open-minded iGEMers of XMU comply with that the communication among teams from all around the world is more frequency. We were active in communication and collaborations with counterparts at home and abroad, as well as propaganda and popularization of synthetic biology and iGEM. A biweekly newsletter, which was cofounded by iGEMers of Paris Bettencourt University and us, XMU team, provided broader communication and colorful later issues and had attracted participators from 30 teams. Besides, we enjoyed net-video conference with domestic and overseas counterparts and study visits to other iGEM teams. Moreover, during the popularization in Xiamen Library, we managed an iconoclastic way that we started with a hot issue, GM food (genetically modified food), which is worldwide popular.
