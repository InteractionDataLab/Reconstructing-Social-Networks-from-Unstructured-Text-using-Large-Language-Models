A REASONABLE EXPLANATION OF MISFOLDING GFP UNDER QS OSCILLATION
In the project iGEM13_XMU-China , they couldn't get expected oscillation. However, this year iGEM14_XMU-China further investigated the reason of abnormal oscillation. We further reviewed SDS-PAGE analysis to confirm the circuit at protein level. The SDS-PAGE data is shown in Figure 1. Based on that, we made a reasonable assumption that the unexpected behavior of the LuxR promoter leads to the misfolding proteins Hence result in the abnormal oscillation result in the abnormal oscillation.
 
Figure 1. SDS-PAGE analysis of E. coli K strain (DH5α). (a) Lane 1-2: supernatant and pellet of original DH5α; Lane 3-4: supernatant and pellet of strain with single plasmid A1 (BBa_K1036003); Lane 5-6: supernatant and pellet of strain with both plasmids A1 (BBa_K1036003) and B (BBa_K1036000). The red arrows indicate the misfolding GFP-LVA protein (27.6 kDa) in the precipitation. (b) Lane 1-2: supernatant and pellet of original BL21; Lane 3-4: supernatant and pellet of strain with single plasmid A1 (BBa_K1036003); Lane 5-6: supernatant and pellet of strain with both plasmids A1 (BBa_K1036003) and B (BBa_K1036000). The blue arrows indicate LuxR (27.5 kDa), GFP-LVA (27.6 kDa) and AiiA-LVA (28.7 kDa) in the supernatant. The orange arrows indicate LuxI-LVA (22.4 kDa) in the supernatant. (The marker of b was not in right position, however, the proteins were confirmed by MALDI-TOF-TOF .)
 
As the SDS-PAGE shows, a large amount of GFP-LVA and LuxI-LVA appear in pellet where misfolding proteins often exist. Both proteins directly affect the oscillation result. And it is critical to find out the reason for misfolding proteins. iGEM14_XMU-China made the following assumption:
   
The research[1] reveals an unexpected behavior of Lux pR (BBa_R0062). In the absence of autoinducer 3OC6 (AHL), LuxR binds to plux (Lux pR) and activates backwards transcription (Figure 2).

The imperfect simplification of setting lux pL and Lux pR in the same direction: 
From the original design by Jeff Hasty, Lux pR and Lux pL were set in opposite directions (Figure 3A). In the absence of AHL, LuxR could activate backwards transcription of Lux pR leading to more expression of LuxR which was critical to meet the oscillation conditions. However, present literature did’t consider the backwards transcription which had effect on quorum sensing oscillation.
 
A. Original Design
B. iGEM13_XMU-China Design
Figure 3A.Top row is the original design by Jeff Hasty.B. Bottom row is the simplified design which sets Lux pL and Lux pR in the same direction.
 
In the simplified design (Figure 3B), when LuxR activates the backwards transcription, RNA polymerase will be blocked by the terminators B0015. So this simplification will not  perform as same as original design. Actually, the reverse terminated efficiency of B0015 is 0.295(CC)[2] which may lead to leakage transcription. However, the correct sequence of GFP-LAA couldn’t be transcribed during the backwards transcription, even if the minus-strand of GFP-LAA could be transcribed, the sequence of the RNA is not in the right direction of GFP-LAA, hence incorrect amino acid sequences might be translated, resulting in misfolding GFP just as what the SDS-PAGE shows (Figure 1).
 
Because of the imperfect simplified design didn’t follow the original function completely, the abnormal oscillation was justifiable. Misfolding protein weren evidence to support our assumption.
 
iGEM14_XMU-China involved sequence comparison to investigate the difference between the original and the registry parts. We found that the original Lux pR had 20bp overlapping sequence with originalal Lux pR. There was a restriction enzyme cutting site (EcoR I) at the 56bp of original Lux pR (Figure 4).
 
Figure 4. Schematic of original QS promoter.
 
Parts registry truncated the original Lux pR at 56bp to get the 55bp Lux pR (BBa_R0062). On the contrary, Lux pL (BBa_R0063) is longer than the original Lux pL, and at the end of BBa_R0063 is initial part of 41bp LuxR (BBa_C0062). Thus new problems arised—was the modification of original QS promoter reasonable? Did the modification result in the unexpected backwards transcription?
 
Quorum sensing system is so widely used in the synthetic biology, we thought it’s remarkable to make it clear. We highlighted the abnormal phenomenon of QS oscillation which might be caused by imperfect simplification for the very first time. We hope that more efforts could be made to figure out the interaction between QS oscillation parts.[3]
