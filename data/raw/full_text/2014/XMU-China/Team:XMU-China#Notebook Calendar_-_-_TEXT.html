In general this electronic newsletter includes two major parts: project update and the introduction of team members. We sincerely hope that through this platform, every team will have a better access to share information and progress, gain feedbacks and favors on their own projects from their peers and even get to know some young promising synthetic biologists. In addition, there are also going to be special issues publishing with interviews of iGEM alumni and advisors from part of college teams in competition.
