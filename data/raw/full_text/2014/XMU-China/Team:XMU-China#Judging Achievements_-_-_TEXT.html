Judging Form
 
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
√ Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2014 Judging form.
√ Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
√ Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
√ The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. Please see the iGEM 2011 Imperial College Acknowledgements page for an example.

√ Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. Please see the Registry help page on adding new parts. A new application and/or outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part's/ Device's function) of a previously existing BioBrick part also counts. Please see the Registry help page on how to document your contributions. To fulfill this criteria, you will also need to submit the part with its original part name to the Registry, following the submission guidelines.

√ iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.

Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal: (one OR more)
√ Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part.

√iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team's scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.

Experiment Achievement
 
Successfully proved that BBa_K1412000 could help CL-1 regain chemotaxis ability
Successfully proved that IPTG would reinforce chemotaxis ability while L-arabinose would constraint that with BBa_K1412001. We also make quantitative validation to find out the optimal concentration. Based on this brick, Cl-1 form a hyperbola boundary on semi-solid culture medium.
Successfully proved that reprogrammed CL-1 would have the tendency to swim to hyperosmosis source. With BBa_K1412010.
Successfully proved that reprogrammed chemotaxis could help characterize promoter activities with BBa_K1412000, BBa_K1412014, BBa_K1412614.
