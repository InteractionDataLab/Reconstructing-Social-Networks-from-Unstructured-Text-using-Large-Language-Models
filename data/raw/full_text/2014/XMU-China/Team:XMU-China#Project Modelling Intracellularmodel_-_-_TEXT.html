INTRACELLULAR MODEL
The following functions are based on ordinary differential equations with Hill functions that captured the activation and repression of protein synthesis.
The intracellular species included cheZ (C or ZT), LacI (L), L-ara (A), IPTG (I).

With above two equations, the relation between stimuli and intracellular is built. With certain concentration of IPTG and L-arabinose, the concentration of cheZ (ZT) will get for the following modeling.
