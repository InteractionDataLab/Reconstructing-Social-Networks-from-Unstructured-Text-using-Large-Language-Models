POPULARIZATION
 
When we enjoy the knowledge and jubilant brought by iGEM, we’ve not forgotten to spread them to the public, and let more people, whether in the field or not, know about iGEM and synthetic biology.
 
On September 12nd to 14th, as a key team of XMU summer social practice, we held a science popularization in Xiamen Library, the city's main library. The activity was aimed at popularizing food safety, transgenosis technology, synthetic biology, and iGEM. Unlike in the past, we put the schematic and explicit posters up in the hall along with explanations, did some interesting experiments, made and played an instruction video.
 
To begin with, we informed the readers knowledge of food safety, which drew their attention. The topic was widely recognized, especially the GM food (genetically modified food) which spark a hot debate. Cui Yongyuan, a Chinese hoster and Fang Zhouzi, a Chinese scholar even had a heated argument in Weibo (Chinese Twitter). Regardless the comments on GM food, we objectively presented its theory and laboratory procedures. And there was a lot of misunderstanding we disabused. We believed that after acquirement of the details, the attitude of the public towards GM food could be more objective.
 
We played a video clipped by Wu Fan, Li Zhe and Liu Chang. The 20 minute video introduced transgenosis technology and synthetic biology. Compared with boring explanation, the intuitional way of popularization was obviously more attractive and effective. We were glad to see our audience absorbed in it.
 
The demonstrative experiments were about distinguishing disqualified and toxic food and chemical knowledge. And their characteristics of image, intuition and interest caught the eye of spectators of all ages. In the course of prize-winning quiz, they scrambled to answer questions.
 
Besides, we did a questionnaire which 140 citizens filled out about food safety. We concluded that 42% citizens made up their mind to safeguard their rights and interests when the safety of their food is threatened, even though nearly all of them were concerned about food safety, and that many people jumped to conclusion that GM food is harmful, without comprehension of the mechanism of transgenic technology.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After the activity, we were happy to be interviewed by media: FJTV-4, Voice of the Strait and Xiamen Daily.
