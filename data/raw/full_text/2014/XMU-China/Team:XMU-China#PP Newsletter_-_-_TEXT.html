NEWSLETTER
 
There is no doubt that iGEM needs a communication platform to share our idea, ask for and receive help. Though we have Meetup, iGEM CC, Facebook and Twitter, indeed, these platforms fail to became popular.
 
We are committed to build an open and easy-to-access platform, on which iGEMers can share their information and exchange resource conveniently within the shortest time.
 
Based on this suggestion, iGEMers of Paris Bettencourt University and we cofounded an information exchange platform named Newsletter on July 28. As a biweekly electronic journal, it is in PDF format and free for readers. Till now 34 teams from Asia and Europe have participated. In general this electronic newsletter includes two major parts: project update and the introduction of team members. We sincerely hope that through this platform, every team will have a better access to share information and progress, gain feedbacks and favors on their own projects from their peers and even get to know some young promising synthetic biologists. In addition, there are also going to be special issues publishing with interviews of iGEM alumni and advisors from part of college teams in competition.
On this platform, iGEM teams from all around the world introduce their programs, share details of experiments, ask for help, and reply to requirements from counterparts. In addition, special issue offers access to peripheral issue, such as interviews to teams and experts, case analysis, experience in team construction and popularization of synthetic biology. We excavate the quintessence of the past work as the shoulder standing on which the following teams could see further.
