Conic Curve

A thing falls a thing.
 
This is a gene collection of forming conic curve pattern. We managed to balance exogenous stimulus with background substrate to form hyperbola by using part BBa_K1412001. Part BBa_K1412000, BBa_K1412002 and BBa_K1412007 are basic parts of BBa_K1412001. Part BBa_K1412009 and part BBa_K1412033 are still in the experimental debugging. Because our circuit design is the balance of several stimulus, and a stimulus can conquer another to a certain extent, which remind us a piece of age-old wisdom: moderation is in all things, one thing falls a thing.

CEASE TO STRUGGLE and cease to live.
  
We develop a new system to characterize the activity of different promoters and efficiency of RBS by chemotaxis. The expression efficiency order is BBa_K1412014>BBa_K1412000> BBa_K1412614. Genes have various intensity RBS, some genes get higher yields with high efficiency RBS, and just like they are racing. So we submit BBa_K1412005 and BBa_K1412006 as standard parts for reference. We also construct BBa_K1412801 and BBa_K1412829 for future characterization.

A RUSH TO SWEET is a rush to ruin!
 
We figured out the influence of osmotic pressure on regulation of expression intensity. Part BBa_K1412008 and Part BBa_K1412010 contain the same function, but BBa_K1412008 is slightly less efficient than BBa_K1412010. E.coli savor the sweet, then they taxis to higher concentration for more sugars, but they cannot get out of. E.coli is like life, true difficile the dreams you are true?
Oscillation Timer

Every dog has its day!
We use BBa_K1412600 to form cell grow rings. The population of cells ups and downs, which could form concentric-like circles. E. coli at low density enjoy more nutrition, while it won’t take long. As one proverbs goes that every dog has its day!
Interlab Study
BBa_K1412716
BBa_K1412924
BBa_K1412999
We got fluorescence data about these three parts.
