Open Lab Blueprint
The Open Lab Blueprint is an easy-to-follow guide to launch and develop a sustainable community biolab. The website is a work in progress and is hosting at OpenLab-Blueprint.org . This Blueprint is a holistic view of the community biolab and includes the following components:
Starting up a lab, including identifying the right space, acquisition of key equipment, and efficiently implementing safety standards and best practices.
Developing a community, including building awareness, developing programs of engagement for students, the amateur scientists, and the general public, and collaborating with the broader scientific and educational communities.
Creating unique content, including educational resources, using the Genspace curriculum and engaging activities, focused on tailored, site-specific explorations and experiments.
Operating a biolab, including a resource base of protocols for standard genetic engineering activities, geared towards a budget-constrained lab, operational best-practices ranging from procurement of reagents to proper storage of experiments, and financial sustainability models.
