The Open Lab Blueprint draft created for this competition is meant to be in a state of continual evolution as we get feedback from users. This summer we provided guidance from the Open Lab Blueprint to new labs being established in several settings including an art-science lab at the Art Institute of Chicago, Nova Labs (a community-based Makerspace in Reston, Virginia) and FamiLAB, a community lab/hackerspace located in Central Florida.  Familab has approximately 80 members, and has been in operation since 2009.  FamiLAB approached GenSpace looking for guidance on adding DIY Bio to their offerings, and is now in the process of implementing the Open Lab Blueprint.
FamiLAB is in the process of moving from a 4000 sq ft space to a 6000 sq ft space, and has been consulting with Genspace's Open Lab Blueprint team on the layout of the area that will be dedicated to DIY Bio.
Our first step was to assess the level of interest within the lab and within the community.  Open Lab provided sample descriptions of possible workshops, and we conducted surveys at our open houses, and at our annual makerfaire. The almost unanimous answer to the survey was "Oh, I definitely want to do the bioluminescence one first."  In response, Genspace's Open Lab Team provided us with a source for bioluminescent dinoflagellates, and advice on buying equipment needed for running a pVIB transformation workshop.    We are in the process of coordinating with the Orlando Science Center to use one of their classrooms for the bioluminescence workshop while our build-out in in progress. The availability of a pre-tested workshop activity is extremely valuable and saves time and effort. It eases the way for group leaders who want to venture into the biology space but who want to start with an activity that is simple and safe that has been pre-vetted.
In the meantime, we utilized some of the Open Lab Blueprint's tactics for building community. Since our members have a strong background in robotics, we held a meetup to build an OpenTrons fluid handling robot.  This was a great event, people with wetlab experience showed up, learned some robotics, and taught the robotics folks a thing or two about how a wetlab should be set up. This was exactly the cross-disciplinary engagement we were hoping for, and planted the seed for future expansion of our space into the bio area.
