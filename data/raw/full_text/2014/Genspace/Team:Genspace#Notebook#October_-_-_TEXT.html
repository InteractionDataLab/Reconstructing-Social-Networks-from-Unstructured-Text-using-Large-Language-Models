10.2.14 Plate with RFP, CFP, and OFP
Background
On 10/2/14, we made a plate to make sure that the following samples would actually work:
Red 1
Red 2
Orange 1
Orange 2
Cyan 1
Cyan 2
Here are some useful links:

Results
Orange 1 does not work.  All of the others look good.  See the attached figures for more details:

Here's a chart to summarize how well the protein was produced.

The RFPs are obviously red, even under white light.  The CFPs have the strongest fluorescence under UV light.
We should probably perform some tests to make sure that we are getting the wavelengths that we are expecting.
There seems to be some stray colonies.  This may be from when I was pipetting.
I took the plate out of the incubator at around 9PM on 10/3/14 (about 21 hours in the incubator).
Conclusions
We should NOT use "Orange 1".  If we have time, we could investigate what went wrong.
We should use the rest.
The plates are in the refrigerator (the one furthest back in the lab) at the location indicated by the file plate location.jpg.
