Two possibilities come to mind:</P><P>1. Chloramphenicol levels are too high. I will double check my math from making them previously. I will also stick the plates back in the 37C incubator - sometimes if the dose is just a bit too high, the cells need an extra day to grow into colonies</P><P>2. Transformation efficiency was very low - we didn't plate enough cells and should have plated the entire culture to get just a few colonies.</P><H2>8.11.14: Results of ligation part 2</H2><P>Yesterday, Marty helped me out by following this protocol after I made fresh LB+Chlor plates:</P><OL><LI>Pull out tubes from fridge (they are in the &quot;class samples&quot; fridge). They are on te top shelf in a styrofoam container.</LI><LI>Spin all tubes 3 min 4000rpm.</LI><LI>Remove 500 ul sup by aspirating and discarding in proper waste.</LI><LI>Resuspend remaining sup and plate on an lb+chlor plate (on the bench top). Same as before, making sure to use te clean beads, not the waste beads!!</LI><LI>Incubate in 37c overnight.</LI></OL><P>Today, he went to check on the plates but there is still no sign of growth on any LB+Chlor plates.</P><P>Regarding Chlor concentration: I previously treated the 34 mg/ml stock as a 294x stock. This makes the final concentration 115 ug/ml, within the standard range of 34 ug/ml - 174 ug/ml for this drug. According to the IGEM website, however, they recommend a 34 ug/ml final concentration, which is how I treated the plates I made yesterday. I thought this less stringent concentration would allow more growth, but apparently no dice so far.</P><P>Random thoughts on why this hasn't worked:</P><UL><LI>DNA concentration? Both the insert and the backbone were both at high enough concentrations for 3 ul to show up on a gel (indicating lack of DNA is not an issue). (I've misplaced this gel image so I can't attach it at this moment).</LI><LI>Transformation competency? We know the cells can be transformed and grow on LB+Amp. We don't know that the cells can be transformed and grow on LB+Chlor.</LI></UL><P>Feel free to add to the discussion if you can think of reasons we may not be getting transformations!</P><H2>8.9.14: PCR of GFP</H2><H3>Background</H3><P>We need more GFP because round of ligation did not work, and we have digested GFP.</P><P>We can't find the GFP plasmid to PCR amplify it, so we are amplifying the previously PCRed Digested and Undigested pieces of GFP (instead of the plasmid) hoping that one of them will yield product.</P><P>Two PCR tubes are in the PCR machine. Tube 1D is the digested GFP (left side of machine). Tube 2 is the undigested GFP (right side of machine).</P><H2>8.12.14: Colony PCRs to check colonies that came from 8.10 ligations</H2><H3>Background</H3><P>In his email on Monday, Eric said he saw a few colonies on the ligation transformation plates (the ones Marty plated on 8.10.14):</P><DIV><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Name</P></TD><TD><P>Construct</P></TD><TD><P># Colonies</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>BB alone</P></TD><TD><P>BB alone</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>BB + A</P></TD><TD><P>OFP</P></TD><TD><P>1</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>BB + B</P></TD><TD><P>YFP</P></TD><TD><P>2</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>BB + C</P></TD><TD><P>RFP</P></TD><TD><P>4</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>BB + D</P></TD><TD><P>CFP</P></TD><TD><P>2</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P>Even though there are more colonies on BB alone than BB+insert, I didn't want to throw away our potential constructs. So we will screen these while simultaneously setting up ligations for the next round of transformations. We will screen in two ways: (1) Colony PCR, which will give us results tonight IF IT WORKS, but I've never done colony PCR before and we don't have any positive control primers (meaning that if we see nothing on the gel, we won't know *why* we see nothing on the gel) and (2) traditional mini preps, from cultures we will inoculate tonight into 3 ml LB+Chlor.</P><P>From the internet, I gathered several protocols and made an amalgam of them, hoping that this will work to generate template DNA plasmid:</P><OL><LI>Add 20 ul DEPC-treated water to a PCR tube (one per colony to be tested).</LI><LI>Using a sterile pipette tip, take *just a smidge* of the edge of the colony. This is the potential biggest source of error, as too many cells or too old of cells will not work. These colonies are old, but if we use the edge of the colony, we can scrape just a bit of the fastest-growing cells (found on the edge) to inoculate into the water.</LI><LI>Incubate at 95C for 10 min in the thermocycler.</LI><LI>Spin down cell debris on tabletop PCR tube centrifuge (~20 sec). Use 2 ul of supernatant as template DNA in PCR reaction below.</LI></OL><P>Next, we set up a cocktail for our PCR reactions:</P><DIV><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><P>Component</P></TD><TD><P>ul/rxn</P></TD><TD><P>x 16 rxns</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>DEPC-treated H2O</P></TD><TD><P>20</P></TD><TD><P>320</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>Primer 1: VF2</P></TD><TD><P>1.5</P></TD><TD><P>24</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><P>Primer 2: VR</P></TD><TD><P>1.4</P></TD><TD><P>24</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><P>From this cocktail, we added 23 ul to PCR tubes (containing desiccated PCR  reagents) and 2 ul DNA template, for a total of 25 ul. We ran this in the thermocycler with the following program:</P><P>95C/4m - [(95C/30s - 55C/30s - 74C/1m)x30 cycles] - 74C/4 min - 4C/infinity</P><P>We added DNA dye directly to the PCR reactions and ran the entire reaction out on a 0.8% agarose gel.</P><H3>Results</H3><P>The gel is beautiful! The colony PCR worked!! We can use this screen to decide which cultures need to be mini prepped tomorrow.</P><P>Here's the bad news: the cultures and PCR reaction numbers are not the same. I can't decipher one from another. I have an *idea* of which is which, but no certainty. This should be avoided in the future with better communication among all team members (I'm not pointing fingers; I just hate that now we have to mini prep all the inoculated cultures. Why for do the short way (colony PCR) if we have to do the long way (mini prep) for all the samples?)</P><H3>Conclusions</H3><P>Lanes 1, 3, and 5-15 look very similar in size to one another. These are likely due to backbone ligation with itself in some fashion.</P><P>Lanes 2 and 4 look like they have a small insert. This may or may not be the size of one of our fluorescent protein genes. We expect the inserts to be ~700-800 bp *larger* than backbone alone, but since these are consistent in size for the same construct (I think), it's possible they are positive hits.</P><P>Lane 16 is the most promising hit. This band shows a shift of about 700 bp above the rest of the bands. This is most likely the A construct, which is OFP. Hopefully mini preps tomorrow confirm this!</P><H2>8.13.14: Miniprep and digest to check constructs</H2><H3>Background</H3><P>The cultures inoculated yesterday are going to be mini prepped by Jonathan.

If I recall correctly, B is the PCR product that was cut by either EcoRI or PstI (I've lost that gel image!). So it makes sense that the mini preps wouldn't' contain this insert.</P><P>From C (RFP): No promising results.</P><P>From D (CFP): Lots of promising plasmids! D3, D4, and D6-D9 all have bands of the expected size!

Next steps: sequence and submit!</P><P>We should also start designing a promoter/RBS to add to these plasmids so we can check them for functionality!
