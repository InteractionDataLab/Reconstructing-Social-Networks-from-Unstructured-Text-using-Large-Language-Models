Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) "Cindy Lou" coding region, intellectual property-free
IP free cyan fluorescent protein.  We have a ribosome binding site (RBS).
Background
We want to take Tuesday's PCR products and put them into the pSB1C3 backbone. 
Digest PCRs:
10 ul PCR product
2 ul cutsmart buffer (10x stock)
1 ul PstI
1 ul EcoRI
20 ul total --> incubate for 30 min at 37C
 
PCR purify digest product (only 14 ul - save 6 ul):
Follow kit protocol. Elute in elution buffer.
Worried that the washed columns won't bind DNA, we are going to use some of the set-aside (unpurified) digest product for a backup ligation. We'll run a gel of our purification, but we are going to set up a ligation beforehand, so we won't have even rough estimates of DNA concentrations.

The above were incubated 30 min at RT then stored at -20C.

Results
We ran a 1% gel of the digest before and after purification. We had a decent yield, maybe 40% of our initial digest product in the purified lanes. 
Conclusions
Next step: Transform the ligated plasmids into E. coli!
