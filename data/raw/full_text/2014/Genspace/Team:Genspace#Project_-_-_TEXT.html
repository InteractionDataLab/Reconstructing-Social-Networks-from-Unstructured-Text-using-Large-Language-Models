What is the Open Lab?
Genspace has a unique opportunity to expand its impact beyond its physical presence in New York and bring hands-on involvement with synthetic biology to schools and communities around the world. The Open Lab is the key step towards this vision; it is the complete set of knowledge, tools, and resources required to successfully develop a thriving community biolab, all created following open source principles. Enthusiast communities and organizations around the world can use the Open Lab to fill in key gaps in knowledge, tools, or resources to launch their own community biolabs.
