The calculation of the existing DNA still exists many problems: for example, DNA computing experiments are applied to the solution of a problem for a class of problem specific, universal has no compatibility; without exhaustive algorithm screening makes the calculation of the required DNA exponential explosion; in order to solve the problem of the use of complete biological method in contrast, at the shortest path computer serial computation without effective complementary, but reduces the computation efficiency; the actual navigation planning tasks often have such as the way of location, road type selection and more complex issues to consider, which is currently the basic graph theory research of biological computational models do not have; DNA calculation of these imperfections is precisely the calculation of DNA broad space to explore, and also is the foundation of our research.

          Our goal was to establish a new biological navigation system for ordinary people, including the establishment of navigation database, the construct of all path according to the specific situation, the design of finding the right path through the visual fluorescence and so on .Our team designed an operating system based on traffic information (from the hotel we live to the center)in order to explain the specific operation and the feasibility of our project.

          The whole city map was abstracted into a element of the collection constituted by a set of point elements and path elements. The abstracted path elements  included all roads in the map and the abstracted point elements included intersections of all roads and some landmark buildings etc. So we designed a set of biological information database. We put the 40bp random single-stranded DNA as the biochemical reaction module of point elements. The biochemical reaction module of &lt;A,B&gt; path element was represented by complementary chain of the second half of the single-stranded DNA represented by point A module and 40bp single-stranded DNA connected with complementary chain of the first half of the single-stranded DNA represented by point B module.
(Database diagram,the city library can also used as node/point library.)

          For leaving the interface so as to insert the logical operation module with the level of representation in the subsequent steps ,we designed specific enzyme cutting site which was different from the standard of biobricks.They were used for screening out a suitable path in our project .

          We would refer to the classical Adelman DNA calculation in Hamilton path so as to help us find all possible pathways.
   At first, we selected all the coding modules that computation module needed . These coding modules would form DNA coding collections of modules with  combination of any cities and any paths by ligase.Then ,we used the first half of the start node's complementary strand and the last half of the terminal node's sequence as the primers. And then do a PCR reaction for these pathway sequence,only leaving the pathway of starting point and end point.

          After thinking of the traditional screening methods in front, we further attempted to screen out the pathway containing the sequences of starting point, end point and other points on the way by the level of gene expression. According to the relevant data, we designed a logic gate expression system for the path planning problem in order to help us to detecting the pathway our project needed through the visual angle. We chose GFP DEVICE as a carrier to realize visualization after comprehensive analysis. The Above-mentioned design narrowed the scope of screening, so we used it in specific enzyme cutting site different from the standard of biobricks, then sequencing and analyzing the results of screening. (The path way sequence will insert in the plasmid by designing the Biobrick.'s prefix and suffix. And then we can use it to do the following test)

          According to the references, we build an constructed an in vivo synthetic-hybrid system（BBa_K1341000）.The promoter of the GFP has −35 and −10 sequence. A lac operator site is upstream of the −35 sequence, a tet operator site is between −35 and −10 sequence, the other tet operator site is downstream the -10 sequence. This promoter can be restrain by the LACI or TETR proteins. We can engineer the system in an Escherichia Coli strain that constitutively expresses lactose repressor (LacI) or tetracycline repressor (TetR) proteins at the same gene circuit. The output fluorescence is then dependent on the input of two small molecule inducers, anhydrotetracycline (aTc) and isopropyl-_-thiogalactoside (IPTG). IPTG and aTc interact with LacI andTetR, respectively, which then free the operator sites for RNAp to bind and initiate transcription. (there are many kinds of engineered GFP promoters can be design in this device, but the LTT promoter have the more apparent GFP expression than other kind of promoters according to model figure in result page.)
This principle can help us build a logic device for our bio-compass.
