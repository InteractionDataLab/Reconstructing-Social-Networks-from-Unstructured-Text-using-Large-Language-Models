BIO-COMPASS
The aim of our project is to build a brand new bio-navigational system that can be used by the ordinary people. The map information will be coded in DNA strand and do corresponding biochemical operations. The bio-navigational database will establish the relationship between biochemical operation instructions and traditional navigation instructions. In order to reduce workload in advance， BIO-COMPASS can also screen reaction conditions according to the road conditions. Furthermore, we try to update the system to adapt to the more complex path plans. For this, we design some special enzyme sites which differ from standard bio-bricks' as the function interfaces. For example, "Logic Gate" genetic device can be inserted in our system to help us solve the path plan which include a transfer station between the start and the destination. BIO-COMPASS will find the best solution by using a variety of detection methods such as electrophoresis and reporter gene.
