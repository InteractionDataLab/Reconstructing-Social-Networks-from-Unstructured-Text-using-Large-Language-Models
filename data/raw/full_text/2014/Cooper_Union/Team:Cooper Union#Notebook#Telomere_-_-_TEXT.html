6/3/14
(Nolana)
Researched genes that affect telomere length (lengthening or shortening).
Possible genes to be used for knockout: HSP104 (long), MAK31 (long), VPS75 (short), SMI1 (short).
Relevant lit: PNAS_Askree
For tomorrow: see if yeast plasmids in lab can be used for programmable kill switch project.  Design primers for gene deletion protocol.
6/4/14
(Nolana)
Designed primers for yeast genes (TLC1, RAD52, HSP104, VPS75, MAK31, SMI1).
Checked plasmids to be ordered for knockout cassettes (pFA6a-kanMX6, pFA6a-TRP1, pAG25).
Transformed DH5α with 6 different BioBrick plasmids (pSB1A3, pSB1C3, pSB1K3, pSB1T3, pSB2K3), two BioBrick RBS (B0030, B0034), and a BioBrick double terminator (B0015); left all 8 to grow overnight.
For tomorrow:  check for cell growth on plates and further grow any colonies that form.
6/5/14
(Nolana)
Plates were checked; colonies were growing on all of them.
Picked 4 genes to order primer oligos for (RAD52, EST4, MAK31, VPS75).
Streaked plates with old yeast strains.
For Monday (I won't be here tomorrow): check yeast plates for colonies
6/9/14
(Nolana)
Checked yeast plates -- all plates grew colonies.
Since EST4 knocked out in conjunction with RAD52 kills the yeast, we decided to use EST1 instead of EST4 in the gene deletion for the kill switch project.
Poured plates -- 3 bottles of amp (100ug/mL). We used 250 μL of 100 mg/mL stock concentration of Ampicillin.
Poured two 0.8% agarose gels, both about 60 mL in each.
Helped set up Restriction Digest Reaction with De novo group (used General Restriction Enzyme Digest protocol):  3 μL buffer, 3 μL BSA, DNA, H2O, and Xho1/Xba1 enzyme.
For tomorrow: design check primers for knockout cassettes (programmable kill switch project)
6/10/14
(Nolana)
Designed check primers to be used to verify gene deletion -- used oligo JM42 (3' tag sequence of sense orientation deletion primer with homology to MX4 cassette) for reverse primer, and 500 bases upstream of each gene (RAD52, EST1, MAK31, VPS75) for forward primer.
For tomorrow: Design amplifying primers for kill switch project.
6/11/14
(Nolana)
Worked with Devora to find the primer sequences for amplifying the VPS75, RAD52, MAK31, EST1; added BioBrick prefixes and suffixes.
Checked all of the different primers and sequences that we ordered to check for forbidden restriction sites: there is one restriction site in KanMX, one in LEU2, and 3 forbidden restriction sites in TRP1; these will need to undergo PCR mutagenesis in order to  remove the restriction sites.
made YPD plates: (meant to make three 250mL bottles of media, but ended up making one 500mL bottle)
