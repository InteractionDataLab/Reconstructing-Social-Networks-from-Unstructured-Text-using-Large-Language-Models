The Cooper Union iGEM Team
as seen through the eyes of others
Wilfrido Castillo
I am a Junior Mechanical Engineer at The Cooper Union. I thoroughly enjoy designing components for the FSAE Cooper Union Team. Occasionally, I will book spontaneous flights to Colombia to visit family. I am the team's official World Cup Expert.
Hua Joe Fung
I am a Junior Chemical Engineer at The Cooper Union minoring in Biomedical Engineering. You can find me walking around the lab, asking everyone what they're up to and making sure everything is moving along smoothly. I enjoy rowing quite a great deal (I am an officer in Cooper's Rowing Club), and try and go visit my "family" in France any chance I get. I am the best in lab - don't let Shoshana or Alexa tell you otherwise. I also have the best hair ever.
Lily Lin
I am a Sophomore Chemical Engineer at The Cooper Union. Aside from being my group's math adviser, I also flex my linguistic muscles by helping Dionne learn Spanish. Speaking of languages, I love learning them and am often found repeating Italian, Arabic, or Korean phrases that I've just discovered. I'm also Sara's partner-in-crime in CSA, and I exercise my eloquent oral skills in Toastmasters. *eats toast* It sure does smell like yeast in here... Also, I'm surprisingly the tallest member of the group despite the fact that I've been told that I'm short by a good number of people.
Jiwoon Park
I am a Sophomore Chemical Engineer at The Cooper Union - I also have already fulfilled my requirements for the Biomedical Engineering minor. Don't let my young looks deceive you, I am super motivate and competent. I established the Bioengineering Students Association at Cooper Union in my spare time. I also have impeccable style and a savvy hostess for all my out-of-town friends. I'm actually a model in disguise.
Jae Ho Jang
I am a Senior Civil Engineer, formally Chemical Engineer, at The Cooper Union. People like to say my full name really rapidly, for what reason, I don't know. I enjoy long walks with spiders, living in subtropical apartments, and getting my sinuses fixed. When I cough, it resonates throughout all 9 floors of the school building.  I do not limit myself to traditional waking/resting schedule, instead, I sleep when I need to and wake when ready. I'm the shortest guy in my group...but that's only because I'm the only guy in the group...so technically I'm also the tallest.
Devora Najjar
I am a Junior Chemical Engineer at The Cooper Union, minoring in Biomedical Engineering. I have the honour and distinct privilege of being the very first student trustee of this institution. I am also thrilled that there is a kosher Dunkin' Donuts two buildings away. If you need a pick-me-up, I'm your person. As the first member of the Cooper Union iGEM team, I hold the final authoritarian say on who gets to perform which biological dance.
Alexa Orrico
I am a Junior Chemical Engineering at The Cooper Union minoring in Biomedical Engineering. Every evening before I go home I clean and organize the lab, but somehow every morning when I come back it has reverted back into a state of chaos. I do copious amounts of reading while I am waiting for my experiments to complete. I miss playing on the volleyball team at Cooper, but am excited to get a chance to lead the team as the coach! I am the best in lab - don't let Joe or Shoshana tell you otherwise.
Rebecca Poch
I am a Sophomore Chemical Engineer at The Cooper Union. When I heard they were going to film scenes from "Elementary" at Cooper, I was definitely a little more than excited. I'm ecstatic about trying the more exotic dishes at dim sum, and no, I am not talking about Pteri dishes. I'm the best breakdancer in the school, and yoooo, sup? I can even do Chinese yo-yo. Thankfully, I'm not the shortest member of the group (when I'm wearing heels) nor am I the biggest bully, phew.
Shoshana Sigal
I am a Chemical Engineering Junior at The Cooper Union perusing a minor in Biomedical Engineering. I can project with great intensity. I am very possessive of my lab tech. I work with great speed and efficiency (except with PCR's). I am the best in lab - don't let Alexa or Joe tell you otherwise.
Nolana Wong
I am a Junior Civil Engineer, at The Cooper Union. I am the queen of the Yeast project(aka Nolana's project), and all questions relating to it are deferred to me. At times, I get involved in extreme sports such as archery tag (look it up) and have plenty of bruises to show for it. I have a fabulous collection of clever t-shirts. I love the spicy clam onigiri, and try and get them before they sell out at Cafe Zaiya. I'm the most knowledgeable at playing ice birdy. Most notably, I'm the shortest member and the biggest bully of the group.
Sara Wong
I am a Sophomore Chemical Engineer at The Cooper Union. While it may seem like I have good intentions, I am secretly diabolical...or is it the other way around? I keep tabs on everything CSA, as expected from CSA's future president. I've also helped start up an Engineers Without Borders chapter at Cooper Union in my free time, and we welcome all majors. I love the idea of jogging, but unfortunately can't get up in the morning. I'm also the second tallest in the group, yesssss, even though I've always been called the shortest.
Karlin Yeh
I am a Freshman Mechanical Engineer at The Cooper Union.  I'm new to synthetic biology, but have been competing in robotics competitions for 8 years. My main role in the lab is designing hardware for the team's various experiments and the occasional repair. When not working on iGEM hardware, you can find me tinkering with my 3D printers or trying to grow Mara de Bois strawberries and Chocolate Habaneros hydroponically.
Dionne Lutz, Technician
♫  Do you want to run your gel now? / Don’t pierce it all the way! / It’s true, you can’t load anymore / Really, no more! / Power on! Now okay… / You have some time before you / What can you do? / Did you update your notebook? / Do you want to run your gel now? / Okay, fine, go take lunch now. ♫
Oliver Medvedik, PhD
I am the mastermind behind iGEM at Cooper Union. I do everything at once. I prefer to spend at much time in the lab as humanly possible, and encourage my students to join me. There are times when I will set up an experiment that will be done at 2 AM, and that is completely acceptable to me. The students have lovingly re-named my cat Misha to Oligo. I am very interested in all things Bio, but the aging process in particular. I am the co-founder of GenSpace, which is the first community biohacking lab and is based in Brooklyn.
