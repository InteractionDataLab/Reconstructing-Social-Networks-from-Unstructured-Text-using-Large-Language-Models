Planned Parts
The scope of our project may be vast, but we only submitted parts we were able to successfully characterize. A lot of other components were considered from each sub-project that did not make it due to time constraints (and a bit of Murphy's Law).
For De Novo Project, primers for truncated TdT enzymes with the BioBrick prefixes were synthesized and used. Referring to the literature, first 81bp, 429bp, and 450bp of TdT were deleted to see the change in efficiency of the TdT's enzymatic function.
The Programmable Lifespan Timer had a collection of genes knocked out, including EST2, MAK31 and RAD52
This summer, four more inputs and outputs were built by The Cooper Union Summer STEM iGEM high school students. The promoters they used were induced by the presence of arsenic, arabinose, lactone and glucose, and the outputs were RFP, YFP, blue chromoprotein, and turquoise chromoprotein. Some of these systems were designed for practical, real world applications -  to detect poisons or help control diabetes by measuring glucose levels.
