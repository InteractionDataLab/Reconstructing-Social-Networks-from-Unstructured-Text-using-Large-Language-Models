JUN JUL AUG SEP
9/4/2014
mini prepped VPS75 BB and stored in -20°C (followed protocol on P14)
prof Medvedik innoculated the VPS75 two nights ago and re-innoculated yesterday -> put in fridge yesterday for today
nanodrop: 86.5 ng/μL
9/5/2014
For Sequencing
10μL plasmid in each PCR tube (2 tubes)
5μL 5 mM FWD primer into 1 tube (labeled SL01)
5μL 5 mM REV primer in 2nd tube (labeled SL02)
Add up how big PSB1C3  (2K) and VPS75 (1K) - those together give a DNA size of 3K
-make at least 50μL of each primer for the 5mM
