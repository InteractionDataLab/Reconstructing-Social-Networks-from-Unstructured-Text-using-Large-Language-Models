30ng vector DNA - 3μL
10X T4 DNA ligase buffer - 2μL
water - 5μL
T4 DNA ligase - 1μL

15μL zymolase w sporulated cells (protocol on 8/11/14)
Counted cells and averaged for 444 in sample 2 and 560 in sample 1
Made 3 plates of each sample
RAD52/EST2 cells from the last growth curve were contaminated with bacteria
Made 2 bottles of 250 mL YPD
1 bottle for YPD plates
LB plates:
LB - Lennox Broth - 4g
agar 1.5% - 3g (in 200 mL)
Autoclave -> don't add things when it's too hot
Add Chlor (1000x) - 200 uL​
40% Glucose
multiply 40% by mL to get grams of dextrose
used 120g dextrose and 300 mL
stirred & heated glucose in 100 mL dH2O then added more dH2O till the desired level of 300mL
restreaked MATA and MATα for mating type checks of 1294, 1296, 1300, 1880 (VT6, MTB, MT7)
For tomorrow/things to do
if start yeast curves, start them at noon
finish up ligation
check on plates in incubator - maybe redo kan- plate w/ ypd if we do replicate yeast
double knockout screening -check other colonies/re-do
biobrick primers
yeast dna protocol - redo w/ biobrick primers
innoculate RAD52/EST2 colony at noon
put ligations in -20°C in morning
8/26/14
ligations put in -20°C
restreaked MAK31::TRP1 colony 7
inoculated and put in roller at noon:
1880
VPS75::TRP1 colony 6
EST2 1296
RAD52/EST2
yeast genomic DNA extraction protocol for biobricking
nanodrop results
EST2 (1300) : 41/6 ng/μL
MAK31 (MT7) : 14.4 ng/μL
VPS75 (VT6) : 26.0 ng/μL
ran PCR of EST2, MAK31, VPS75 for biobricking
30 cycles
95°C, 30 sec
56°C, 30 sec
72°C, 90 sec
72°C, 120 sec
Made 2 250 mL bottles for YPD plates
1 250 mL bottle for KANMX plates (250μL G418)
For tomorrow
Run gels of biobrick inserts
if they worked, double digest, purify
transform along with VPS75
Select more sporulated cells
Check cells growing on sporulated plates
Growth curve at noon (make triplicate samples)
check mating type of EST2/RAD52, 1294, 1296, 1300, 1880 (VT6, MTB, MT7)
mate EST2 and MAK31/VPS75 for sporulation
Research
gibson assembly (isothermal) for "super plasmid"
yeast operons ( for EST2, RAD52 )
prerecombinase done in iGEM already?
biobuilder.org -> look for beta carotene yeast, possibly use as a measure to characterize growth curves, senescence vs nonsenecence
thin layer chromatography (TLC)
gas chromatography
check iGEM deadlines
8/27/14
Zymolased (2) and (3) sporulation samples with 15μL at 11:30 AM, wait 30 min
(2) after diluting 2 times 1/10, counted an average of 88 cells (with 87 and 95)
(3) after diluting 2 times 1/10, counted on average 82 cells (with 80 and 84)
Made 2 1% gels
Ran gel of biobricking PCR product
Wells: 1 blank ; 2 blank ; 3 Versa Ladder ; 4 EST2 ; 5 MAK31 ; 6 VPS75
Gel Results
EST2 - band on 2K bp
MAK31 - band on 600 bp
VPS75 -band on 1K bp
1K expected...
checked mating types of 1880, VT6, MTB, MT7, EST2/RAD52
Made 1 250 mL bottle for SD plates (for mating selection) (no dropout mix added
1 bottle KAN/LEU
1 bottle HIS
8/29/2014
Note: 1880 is DSY strain
2 250 ml LEU- plates made
VPS75 BB transformation check
1 white colony on 1 dephosphorylcoted plate
dense reds on not plates==> restreaked white colonies on gridded chlor- plates
Mating type plate of EST2/RAD52, 1880, VT6, MTB,MT7
=>MATA:1880 MTB,VT6,EST2,RAD52
MT7 grew on both sides (possible diploid)
replicated 1294 1296 1300 on SD selection plate
replicated sporulated cells
Stopped growth curve for weekend
