OpenGelBox
The OpenGelBox is an easy-to-build midi gel box that can run up to 30 samples simultaneously. It is built using 6mm and 2mm acrylic sheets with a laser cut time of under a half hour. Previously, our lab would need to run several mini gels in series in order to analyze a large number of samples. With the OpenGelBox, we can more quickly analyze many samples while minimizing the use of consumable materials involved in gel electrophoresis.

Parts
6mm and 2mm acrylic sheet
20x20mm acrylic square rod
2 Male Banana plugs (or the your standardized plug)
Platinum wire (AWG 30)
Four M3x15 screws and nuts
Acrylic glue
Cut List
6mm sheet
Two “Sides”
One “base_plate”
Two “electrode_plate”
Two “front_back”
One “lid_top”
One “lid_electrode”
One “gel_base”
2mm sheet
Two “Comb”
Two 20x20x190mm acrylic square rods
Assembly
Glue all plates, except the “electrode_plate”, together using acrylic glue. Clamps are recommended to ensure a watertight seal and better alignment.
Attach male banana plugs to holes in the “sides” plate
Attach the electrode wire to the power plugs and thread through the small hole in the “electrode_plate” so that the small hole is on the opposite side of the power plugs and the wire is behind the grate section
Screw both “electrode_plate” pieces to their respective sides using M3 screws
Notch two evenly spaced slots into the acrylic square rods, this will be where the combs sit. The notch depth depends on your gel thickness but should be around 9mm
Glue the square rods to the “gel_base” using the combs as alignment references
Glue lid pieces together and attach female banana plug
