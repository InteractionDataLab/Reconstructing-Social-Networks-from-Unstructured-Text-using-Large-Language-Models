JUN JUL AUG SEP
7/1/14
(Nolana)
Yeast transformed inoculated overnight cultures of 1880, 1882, and W303a
PCR'd 4 samples for yeast deletion cassettes: MAK31+TRP1 (MT), MAK31+LEU2 (ML), VPS75+TRP1 (VL), VPS75+LEU2 (VL)
Took photos of yeast plates to check for growth (1294, 1296, 1297, 1300, and W303alpha); restreaked all plates
(Jae Ho)
Yeast Transformation>>Follows Protocol
PCR plasmid purification skipped due to time restraints.
AMT, AVT, 82VL, 80ML Transformations prepared, and plated. w303A, 1882, 1880 Negative control plates also prepared.
For tomorrow: run gel of PCR samples
7/2/14
(Nolana, Jae Ho)
restreaked yeast plates from last week (the ones that were likely to be TRP);
6 Plates restreaked at day 4 after day 1 (faint): W303α+TRP1-1, W303α negative control,          W303α+TRP1-3
Photos of yeast plates/restreaked: 1300, 1294, 1296,1297, w303α
Due to deletion of EST2, 1294,1296,1297 are fading:dying
New transformation done by prof. Medvedik: wrong plates on original transformation
Ran gel with yesterday's PCR samples (MT, ML, VT, VL) with one of the De Novo group's pet28+TdT samples.  Used VersaLadder.
Wells: 1. blank ; 2. ladder ; 3. VT ; 4. VL ; 5. MT ; 6. ML ; 7. pET28+TdT
Sizes expected: 1074 for VT and MT, 2415 VL and ML
Results: we had to stain the gel with ethidium bromide because everything was too faint at first.
VL and ML had approximately 2kb; VT and MT had approximately 1kb --> good results!
However, there were other bands that showed along with the PCR amplification -- maybe raise temperature to 56°C instead of 54°C.
For tomorrow:  run PCR with same samples, but with different temperature
7/3/14
(Jae Ho)
PCR machine not available, unable to do PCR
Restreaked cultures and took photos
Restreaked successful transformation colonies: Mak31+TRP1/VPS75+TRP1
For later: PCR  EST1+LEU2, EST1+TRP1
Out of TRP plates
7/7/14
PCR: EST1+TRP1, EST1+LEU2
Culture preps: W303A, W303α, 1300, 1296
New YPD plates made
Plates struck
Gel Run with 1% gel and 1k ladder:
Two showed nothing while the third ET showed multiple bands.
Could be contamination in sample/annealing temperature problem (54°C->56&degC, maybe try 58°C)
Tomorrow: Transformation
7/8/14
(Nolana)
Ran 1% gel of PCR samples ET1, ET2, EL1, ET2.
Wells: 2. BioLabs 1kb ladder ; 3. EL1 ; 3. EL2 ; ET1 ; ET2
Gel results were faint, so we stained the gel in ethidium bromide for 15 minutes.
Expected sizes -- ET: 1074 ; EL: 2415.
Results: the ET sizes matched but the EL did not -- maybe the plasmid template is contaminated;
miniprep LEU2 plasmid again?
Checked and restreaked yeast plates to check for growth
Yeast transformation of W303α, W303a, 1300, 1296
1296 discarded for transformation

Results: gel 1 had one faint band at A7, we stained the gel in 400 mL H2O and 500μL ethidium bromide for 15 minutes.
After staining, the band was still faint.  All the Plate B samples on gel 2 had successful knockouts, but we realized the samples were taken from one streaked out colony.
Streaked out 2 YPD plates for the MAK31:TRP1 deletion: 1 plate B colony, A7
Overnight PCR of Plate B colony to double-check deletion: one sample with universal primer, one sample with gene check primer

Ran gel of last week's MT samples: 2 samples: one with universal primer, one with gene check primer.
Wells: 1. blank ; 2. Versa ladder ; 3. universal ; 4. gene check
Results: there were bands for both lanes on the gel, which corresponded to their respective sequence sizes (universal: 275, gene check: 406) -- maybe yeast strain is diploid?

5μL
45μL
