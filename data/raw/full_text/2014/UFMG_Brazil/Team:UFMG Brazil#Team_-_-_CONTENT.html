During my scientific initiation, I participated in research projects involving models of wound healing, using pharmacological approaches and studies of the impact of the absence of microbiota in germfree animals in these models. Also participated in work with stem cells from human umbilical cord and their behavior under the effect of bradykinin potentiating peptides among others. In 2013 I joined the graduate program in biochemistry and immunology of ICB / UFMG and so far I am directed by Professor Andréa Mara Macedo, and co-directed by Professor Gloria Regina Franco. Currently my research project is to use approaches to next-generation sequencing to study molecules that may be involved in differential tropism of Trypanosoma cruzi in mice .</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="grid_4"><DIV class="thumbs"><DIV class="capture"><H5>Marcelo Miranda</H5><P style="display:none;">Graduated in Dentistry by Federal University of Minas Gerais (2010), has advanced course in Biotechnology by Tufts University (2013) and Culture Cell Manipulation (2013) – Boston University (2013).
