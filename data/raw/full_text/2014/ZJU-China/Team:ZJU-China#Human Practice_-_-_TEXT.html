Celebrate the birthday of iGEM
We want to thank IGEM for it has provided such a great platform for us to pursuit our dream, so we write this song, which can be regarded as a gift for its 10 years anniversary. We know clearly those great changes it has brought us, either doing a program with a group of fellows which we are all interested in, or communicating with other groups coming from home and abroad, or sharing our work with other confederates from high school. We know that this world is full of miracles, and in the world of Synthetic biology, we know, it isn't small. Aiming to reconstruct the natural biological system, or to get the best understanding of how the natural biology system works thus building a new biology system. IGEM has gone through 10 years full of brilliant ideas spreading around all attending universities. We know, it's great, and IGEM deserves it.
What's more, we wrote this song and sing it out loudly because we want to spread our love of science and our belief of innovation to everyone in this world. There are a large portion of people in the society who don't know what synthetic biology is or what exactly science is. We want to let people around us see how beautiful the scientific world is. Nature is charming and the journey of exploration is interesting and meaningful. Every biologist is an adventurer and artist. We can make tomorrow a better day via our ideas and experiments! Viva la iGEM!
Cheer up iGEMers
