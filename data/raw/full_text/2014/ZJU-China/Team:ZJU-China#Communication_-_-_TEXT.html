High School Sharing session
Inspiration can be the best flower of our research.
Research can be limited when we are only busy by ourselves with our own development while to communicate with other groups surely will do us a great favor in widering our mind, so does the sharing meeting with our high school fellows. We specially made a chance to share with high schoolers the basic genetic knowledge and present them the work we do. Vivid pictures and live videos have attracted them deeply into the world of genetical engerneering, and when we played a game with each of us leading a small group of them and helping them explain the detailed work of genes, they showed great interest in discovering the new world. This is indeed what we need, to gather every single inspiration to prolong our research and promise our program a better day.
United, and we are stronger.
We have communicated with many schools, such as Beijing University, Fudan University, Harbin University, Xiamen University during the time when we are undergoing our research, sometimes they come along to meet us and we can talk about the work we are now busying with, sometimes they can provide us with some stuff or instruments which we are lack of. Cooperation benifits each other. We learn from one another, either technically or theoretically. Every team joins iGEM to compete, but what they want isn't only about winning the game, there're something about a better day, a better day when every partner fullfills his or her dream of getting the hang of reconstructing the biology system. It's a great dream, so we want to be united, to tick out every mistake and to record our developments.

The Peking Team tested cell fluorescence behavior for us. In return, We helped them test the stability of our suicide genes by transferring them into E.coli genome. They did research in sensing and defencing harmful algal, so fluoresence is important for them and us.
