Project
The GeneSocket’s idea is put forward by ourselves and became rich and colorful during countless discussion. All detail design and experiment are accomplished by our own.
Wet lab works
We divide our wet lab manpower into two groups: Lambda red group and circuit construct group.
Liangxi Wang, Sophie Chen, Peng Lei and Haoran Ma are in Lambda red group who do paper researches to summary Lambda red protocol. Although we meet many difficulties during this process, we finally get success in red recombination!
Haniqng Liu, Chaofan Zhang, Qing Xia, Chuanyun Xu is in circuit design group. We design all the circuit and construction strategy by ourselves. Circuit and it’s function is also tested by this group.
Our advisor Zhihui Qin and Qingshu Wu also provide generous help and experiment guide to us.
Dry lab works
Haoran Ma is the designer and builder of our software tool: GS-BOX. Wei Liu accomplish Modeling of GeneSocket. Zhe Zhu design and writing our wiki.
Human practice and other works
Tianyu Li handle all the financial affairs of our team. She also design and organize human practice activities. Tianyu Li, Haoran Ma and Chuanyun Xu organize our songs for iGEM.  Kang Ding draw all the pictures on wiki and made other team related art designs. Chuanyun Xu are responsible for finding sponsor.
