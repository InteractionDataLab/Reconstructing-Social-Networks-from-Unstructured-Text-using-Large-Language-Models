Working process of GeneSocket
Look through this page, and you will understand the working process of GeneSocket inside the cell and learn corresponding experiment step.
Details in Socket E.coli
Tasks for you
Design circuit and find your parts DNA
Use GS-BOX to design the strategy of circuit construction
PCR to add Homeoregion, Ligase standard parts.
Lambda red protein is expressed during cultivation
Making electrotranformation competent cells, use reporter 1 to select.
Inserted circuit(dsDNA) are introduced into Socket.coli.
electrotranformation
Inserted circuit recombine biterminator unit
Cell recovery after electrotranformation, liquid cultivation.
Int express after recombination, flip over attB/attP site
Stage switched, reporter 2 expressed
plate cultivation, Use reporter 2 to select candidate cells
Xis express, Int+Xis will flip over attL/attR sites. Stage switched again and inverted biterminator unit flipped over to silence Int expression
  
  
select positive colony to amplify, Arabinose induce at the main time. Use plasmid backbone resistance to select.
plate cultivation, Use reporter 1 to select candidate cells. This survival cells are ready for the next recombination round.
If circuit construction is over, cultivate cell in 42℃ to discard Support device.
