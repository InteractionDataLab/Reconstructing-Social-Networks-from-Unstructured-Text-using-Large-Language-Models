2. Recombination

description:
In this part, what we want to do is to find out the probability of the recombination of gene of interest through simple molecular dynamics simulation. Although this simulation is quite simple, it certainly can tell us something right in some aspects within a certain accuracy.
The most important things for simulation are initial conditions and boundary conditions. Next, I will describe the initial conditions and boundary conditions in detail.
Initial conditions:
What is initial condition? Simply, initial condition is the condition when your simulation starts. More simply, initial condition is that you know every molecular coordinate as well as velocity if needs.
Boundary conditions:
What is boundary condition? E coli has a boundary, when the molecule runs out of its boundary, we should adjust it back in the E coli. In this simulation, periodic boundary condition is used.
Some basic biology facts and simulation parameter choice:
figure.1 E.coli cell
As shown above, the shape of E coli is similar to a cylinder. So in our simulation, we regard E coli as a cylinder whose radius is 0.5 micrometer, height is 2 micrometer.
2.By looking up some online information, we find the average velocity of protein in cells is about 10 , we estimate the average velocity of gene of interest fragment is the same order of magnitude of the protein for their mass is the same order of magnitude.
3.E coli replicate its chromosome in 40 minutes, the proceed rate of replication fork is about 10^5 bp/min. A fragment about 1kb needs 0.6s.
results
We have simulate this for three times.The results are showed above,Which is consistent with our wet lab result.Although our simulation is quite simple,the result is good.
