Our Safety Protocol
Lab Safety
Zhejiang University has set a strict protocol to ensure the safety of laboratory. Students are required to wear protective equipments including lab-gown, long pants, gloves, etc, while dealing with chemical and biological reagents. A room is specialized for DNA gel even we use ExRed replace EB as laboratory has a reasonable division.
Research Safety
All students involved have been trained to operate equipments, reagents and strains in a safe way. We are not able to do ecperiments until we pass the bio-safety examination.
Environment Safety
All the strains DH5-alpha, BL21(DE3),DH10-beta and BW25113 we used don't contain F plasmid, which guarantees that our genes would not spread to other bacterial in environment. The useless bacterial colonies will be sterilized before abandoned.
