About Zhejiang University
Located in the historical and picturesque city of Hangzhou, Zhejiang University(ZJU) is a prestigious institution of higher education in China with a long history. Qiushi Academy, the predecessor of Zhejiang University, was founded in 1897 and was one of the earliest modern academies of higher learning established in China. During World War II, Zhejiang University suffered from disasters but insisted on the school spirits “Seeking the Truth”, and been praised as one of the Four most Prominent Universities in the Republic China. In its 115-year history, Zhejiang University has always been committed to cultivating talent with excellence, advancing science and technology, serving for social development, and promoting culture, with the spirit best manifested in the university motto “Seeking the Truth and Pioneering New Trails”.
Today, Zhejiang University is one of the top universities in China with distinctive features and a national as well as international impact. Research at ZJU spans 12 academic disciplines, covering philosophy, economics, law, education, literature, history, art, science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, management and etc. The elective system of ZJU is very flexible，so students can enroll whatever the courses they are interested in. That is why we could build such a team with various majors but have no difficulty in understanding each other.
Zhejiang University Anthem
The vast sea contains all streams, all rivers;
Great learning connects Heaven and Earth.
Metaphysical is Tao; instrumental is Tool.
Rites tell people apart; Music gets them together.
To know their relations would make us ever brighter.
There’s a national university standing by River Qiantang,
Whose eternal philosophy is seeking truth from facts.
Progressive education can produce those able to govern;
Never say you know the essence, let alone the truth.
Reform is necessary, and renewal is a must;
To be a vanguard is to be both creative and innovative;
Dear young vanguards should be clear of the principles.
Be devoted to study, deep in thinking and good in understanding;
We offer arts, science, agriculture, technology, and beyond;
It needs you to know them all -- their origins and applications.
To become successful people will be like true gold to be made;
To give up fractional views we’re of far sight and broad mind;
To rejuvenate our great nation is to harmonize the whole world.
