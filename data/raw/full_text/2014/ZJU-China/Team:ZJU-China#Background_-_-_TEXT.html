The technology we used in GeneSocket
λ-Red
Recomibination system
A site flexible recombination system use three protein and work efficiently.
Recomibinase based
Bistable switch
Direct change on DNA molecule to switch state.
We get inspiration from the outstanding work of predecessors, while we are not satisfied with the mere following of techniques. We adopt recombination system to achieve better performance.
