Convertion Module
Convertion module is constructed to create an E.coli that able to survive the present of toxic agent, such as ethylene glycol that being introduce in the system. The module consist of two enzymes, glycoaldehyde reductase and glycoaldehyde dehydrogenase. The enzymes are responsible in metabolising ethylene glycol in E.coli strain BL21 (DE3). The first mentioned enzyme is responsible to catalyse convertion reaction of ethylene glycol to glycoaldehyde while the second one is responsible to catalyse the reaction of glycoaldehyde to glycolate. This intermediate will proceed the next step of metabolic pathway of E.coli and finally ends up on TCA cycle. This process will create an energy (ATP) that can be used by bacteria as carbon source, thus assuring us that ethylene glycol will not pollute the environment.
