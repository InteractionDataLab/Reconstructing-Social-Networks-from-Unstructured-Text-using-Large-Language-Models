Introduction of Synthetic Biology to Pasundan University, Bandung
Synthetic Biology is a new important multidisciplinary to developed in this era. Therefore, ITB_Indonesia team has a vision to makes synthetic biology more well-known and can be applied in human life. In order to achieve our vision we socialize the synthetic biology to universities in Indonesia.
Team ITB_Indonesia had an opportunity to introduce Synthetic Biology and iGEM in the event called "Biology Education Expo (BEE)" on 3th May 2014. In this occasion, ITB_Indonesia presented about Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition itself to Pasundan University (UNPAS) students. Besides, ITB_Indonesia team also presented an overview about team project that will be brought to iGEM competition in Boston. The participants were very enthusiast in our explanation about the project and the synthetic biology in general. They had a lot of questions and looked very interested in synthetic biology. ITB_Indonesia Team had a commitment to accompany Pasundan University (UNPAS) to get more information about synthetic biology for their future needs.
