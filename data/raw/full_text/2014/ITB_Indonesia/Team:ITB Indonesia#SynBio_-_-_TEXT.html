Synthetic Biology Class
One of the ITB_Indonesia human practice activity was organizing synthetic biology class in our faculty. We divided participants into groups. Each group created a unique idea correlated to synthetic biology and made a system composed of series of biobricks which available in iGEM parts registry. Those ideas then were presented in the class. In addition, each group needed to expose functions and applications of their own idea. The presentation was very inspiring. A lot of idea could be a solution for problems that recently happened, especially in our country, Indonesia. Participants were very enthusiast to discuss about those ideas and projects proposed by each group such as smart yogurt, ''Escherichia coli'' cupid, ecolosa, etc.
