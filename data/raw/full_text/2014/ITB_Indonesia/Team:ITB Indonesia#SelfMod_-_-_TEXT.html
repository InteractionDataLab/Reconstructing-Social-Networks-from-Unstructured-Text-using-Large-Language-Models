Self Regulatory Module
Self-regulatory module is designed to repair the inefficiency of system due to formation of inclusion body. Inclusion body is formed from aggregation of misfolded protein caused by overexpression of LC Cutinase protein (degradation module). Besides being inefficient to the system, inclusion body may also kill the organism because it gives a cytoplasmic stress to cell.
When inclusion body occurs, inclusion body inducible promoter (PibpAB) will active and the expression of TetR repressor will take place. This TetR repressor then corresponds to TetO in degradation module and inhibits the expression of LC Cutinase protein. This inhibition effect will eventually decreasing the inclusion body present in the cell and improving the system efficiency.
