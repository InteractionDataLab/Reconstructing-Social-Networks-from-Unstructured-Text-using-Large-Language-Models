SHARING SYNBIO IN UPI
Sharing synbio in UPI
We shared experiences. On 9th October 2014, we visited biology department of UPI (Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia). In the presentation, we shared about biosynthetic, an overview of our project, and what we have done during the project for the iGEM 2014. Participants have high enthusiasm in this presentation. It can be seen through the questions asked. The atmosphere of the discussion session was very interesting.
