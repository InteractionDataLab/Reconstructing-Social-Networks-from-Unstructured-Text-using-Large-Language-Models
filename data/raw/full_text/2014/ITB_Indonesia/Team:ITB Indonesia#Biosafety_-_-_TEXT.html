Safety is a major concern in synthetic biology research, especially when researchers make constructions of genetic material of living organisms. Hence, it is very important for ITB_Indonesia team to understand deeply all about laboratory safety. To meet the requirements, some member of ITB_Indonesia team participated in biosafety seminar and workshop, organized by Permi and P2PKO ITB. This workshop held on August 23th 2014. This event discussed about safety procedure in laboratory, animal ethics test, laboratory safety levels knowledge, etc.
Finally this seminar and workshop expected to provide lots of knowledge about laboratory safety and guide team ITB_Indonesia wetlab activities.
