Protein Modeling
The SWISS-MODEL Repository is a database of annotated three-dimensional comparative protein structure models generated by the fully automated homology-modelling pipeline SWISS-MODEL. The Repository currently contains about 300.000 three-dimensional models for sequences from the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases. Figure 1  shown the protein model of our oMPA-LcCutinase. Figure 2 shown the detail Swiss model summary
