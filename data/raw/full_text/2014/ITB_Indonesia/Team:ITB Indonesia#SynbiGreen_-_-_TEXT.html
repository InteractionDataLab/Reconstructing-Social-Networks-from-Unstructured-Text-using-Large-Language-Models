SynbiGreen Survey
Synthetic biology is a new multidisciplinary field. Thus ITB_Indonesia team wanted to share synthetic biology knowledge and also had a vision to help the initiation of synbio group in other universities. One of the implementation was through the introduction of synthetic biology in Pasundan University.
In this activity, questionnaire was propagated to know the opinion of UNPAS students about synthetic biology. The result told us that 100% respondent showed an interest to study it and they thought that synthetic biology could be used to solve Indonesian problems: 17.24% of the respondent wanted to solve health problems through synthetic biology, 13.79% from the respondent wanted to solve environment problems, and 62% respondent thought that energy problems could be solved through synthetic biology.
Another survey also took place in this activity. This survey was about plastic issue that will be brought by ITB_Indonesia team to iGEM 2014 competition in Boston. This survey depicted that 57% respondent used plastic in their daily activity and 48% of the respondent discarded those plastic wastes. The awareness to recycle plastic wastes were very low and may cause accumulation of plastic wastes, especially bottle packaging. Therefore, such an environmentally degradation system was inevitably required.
