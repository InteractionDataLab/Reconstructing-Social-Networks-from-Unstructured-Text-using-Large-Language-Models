The plastic waste problem is an issue that already has a great environment detriment records and always a hot topic to discuss about, especially in “Go Green” concept that is currently being developed. Many alternative solutions have been proposed to solve this problem; however, the solution has not been completely effective. Therefore, ITB_indonesia team is eager to make a quick fix through the idea of plastic bottle degradation. ITB_Indonesia team was highlighted by some media, both online and printed media, okezone.com, detik.com, and fokus magazine.
Through the media facilities, ITB_Indonesia team hopes to provide an alternative solution for handling plastic bottles waste as well as introduce the synthetic biology to people.
