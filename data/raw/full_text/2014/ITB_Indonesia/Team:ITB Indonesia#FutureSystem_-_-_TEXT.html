CHAPERONE PROTEIN
A misfolded protein may form from aggregation of primary structure of protein that is overexpressed in the cell. This aggregation may create inclusion body which will lower the bacteria metabolic efficiency. If this condition is continuously happened, the death of the cell may occur. Therefore, it is important to decrease the inclusion body in the cell to increase the lifespan of the cell.
If chaperone is introduced to the system, it will act as an agent to refold the misfolded protein. This chaperone will be integrated in bacteria genome. The inclusion body then will be refolded and restore the activity of the protein as it normally would. With this system, the efficiency and effectiveness of bacteria recombinant gene expression and metabolic load will be better.
