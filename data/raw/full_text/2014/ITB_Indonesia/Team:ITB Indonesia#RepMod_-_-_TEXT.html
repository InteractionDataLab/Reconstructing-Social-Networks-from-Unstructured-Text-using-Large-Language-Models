Reporter Module
Reporter module is designed to detect the existence of cytoplasmic stress by naked eye. One of the cytoplasmic stresses is the formation of inclusion body due to overexpression of LC Cutinase in degradation module. The overexpression of the protein may result in an inefficient protein folding where not 100% proteins are useable and probably, the misfolded protein will create an aggregate known as inclusion body that decreasing the system efficiency.
Inclusion body inducible promoter (PibpAB) then will detect the formation of inclusion body and report it by expressing amilCP, a blue fluorescent protein that detectable by naked eyes, make it easier to analyze whether the stress level of the cell is in the limit or beyond the limit.
