UESTC-China mainly consisted of the juniors from school of life science and technology. The group were divided into 3 sub-groups, the first focused on design of the project, the second were responsible for the artwork and activity organization, and the third paid their attention to wiki construction. Besides, we would like to thank our altruistic instructors and advisors, who helped us a lot in the whole process.
Team Members
Ke Han, who may also called Roxanne, is in charge of artwork. Though majors in bioinformatics, she gains lots of experimental skills by iGEM. Now she has been getting a more clear view of synthetic biology by working in the lab. And watching her making all kinds of mistakes is hilarious, which eases us from pressure.
Jiao He, a racy and sanguine girl, is mainly responsible for the human practice. Besides that she also does some writing and paper work for constructing wiki. Though lacking particular skill like anyone else possess in our team, she contributes a lot to our team for tackling some trivial or petty but important things for our team.
Yasong Cui is the leader of our team. With his excellent grade and domination in synthetic biology, he is called "Lord of School". We turn to him every time when problems come up. So having too much things to do is always a problem for him. He loves to have some midnight snacks after long time experimenting.
Jie Li is a hardworking junior student with a good sence of humor. He can pull it off for several days and nights to complete his experiment. And he is really funny in our daily life. During summer time trainning, his jokes kept our team in a good mood.
Jingyao Li is a junior studying biotechnology and plant genome engineering in the university of electronic science and technology of China. She works on vector construction and plant transformation. At the same time, as the lab manager of UESTC-China team, she takes charge of the wet lab. Outside of the lab, she loves traveling and climbing.
Rui Liu is a huge fan of basketball. With his passionate attitude and appealing personality, he is in charge of human practice. And he works in lab, too. His favorate sports star is Kobe Bryant. And it's his dream to take his girlfriend to the Staples Center, watching a live game together.
Weixin Liu, the head of modeling. With competitive mathematics background, he is indispensable for our team. Not only math, he is also interested in the way life operates, including its metabolism, reproduction and regulation. He has a deep comprehension of the life machine and is the control of the modeling team.
Zihui Yan studies in the Plant Genome Engineering Laboratory, so he is very good at experimenting. And he is very involved with plants. At his spare time, he likes to play tennis, talk to others, and play the game "League of Legends".
Zhiqiang Yan is the wiki builder of our team. He has a competitive power of programming, which is a complimentary of our team. In his spare time, he enjoys riding and playing basketball. Especially, he is fascinated by 3D movies, which is very fantastic.
Instructors
Yong Zhang  Professor Zhang tutored us about how to construct a vector, in his class "Genetic Engineering" last semester. He quoted a shocking number of examples to walk us through the class, so we got to understand these technologies better.
Xuelian Zheng  Professor Zheng is quite rigorous about her experiment, which is really a model for us. And she was in charge of the lesson "Molecular Biology". She taught with her loving personality. And she is also a amiable mother, who loves to share jokes about her son.
Lixia Tang  She is wise lady with a graceful vioce and she cares about us a lot. With her advices about experimental skills, like how to use the pipette properly without larger deviation. It sure to make us easier to put the knowledge into practice in our project.
Advisers
Xu Tang  Tang just finished his first year as a postgraduate student. Whenever we see him, he's fully occupied with experiment. And personally our team leader admires him for his rigorous scholarship. Yet during lunch break, he brings us a lot of fun.
Zhengyang Xie  We call her "senior xie" for nickname because she is so confident with her knowledge of biology. And she is a very warmhearted kind person who is also pretty cool. Last summer she rode her way around the largest lake of western China, and took this picture.
