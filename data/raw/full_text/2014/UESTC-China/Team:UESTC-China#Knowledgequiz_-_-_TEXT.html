Knowledge quiz
This year, UESTC-China 2014 iGEM had been working on the item of diminishing formaldehyde. As for that, we tried to use the principle of synthetic biology to make a plant to absorb formaldehyde largely. And on June 6, we conducted a knowledge quiz activity to popularize iGEM, letting more Chinese know the competition, and drew their attraction on synthetic biology. To crystallize the goal, we bought many gifts such as delicate plants, cartoon fans for the people who joined in our activity.
Knowledge quiz activity
The two in our first sight were our team leader Yasong Cui (the right) and our wiki manager Zhiqiang Yan (the left), you could see the smile on their faces. Both in their hands held our cartoon fans and delicate plants which were used as little gifts for this activity. Behind of them was our activity's banner.
Incentives
Our team members were packing our little gifts for the activity in this picture. We bought 200 cartoon fans and 30 green plants as an incentive to attract people who were passing by. Once the person answered our questions can he own a cartoon fan, if he answered two questions correctly then he could win a plant.
Participation of the olds
The olds were also interested in our activity. In this picture you could see the old asking our team member question. The slips in their hands were our questions. By answering the paper questions, passers-by could be more eligible about iGEM and our team's project. And meantime, the activity here attracted more and more people to join in.
Our team members
After this activity, all of us took a photo as a souvenir. Everyone enjoyed this moment just like the day farmers harvest. I still remember the moment of shuttle click, we all cheered loudly. As the banner's going, “hope the leaves bring you some green in June”.
Lovely spot
In this picture you could see the old engaging in the question. The slip of paper in his hands was our question. By answering the paper questions, passers-by could be more eligible about iGEM and our team's project. And meantime, the activity here attracted more and more people to join in.
More and more people are attracted
You could see more and more people were in our activity, one who took part in this activity then asked their friends to attend. And you could catch the countenance on the girl's face, which was so devoted. She had already won the first part, and this time, she was answering the second part.
A girl winning one pot of plant
When the activity was coming to end, people who answered the questions accurately gained a plant, the lovely girl in the picture was one of them. She said she was satisfied with our activity, and after this activity she had learned more about synthetic biology as well as something about the iGEM.
Winners
When the activity was ending, people who answered the questions accurately gained one pot of our plant. The most meaningful thing was that they thought they had learned a lot about synthetic biology. They all felt satisfied with our little gifts. One of them also said, she wanted to visit our lab to see this magical plant which could absorb formaldehyde largely.
