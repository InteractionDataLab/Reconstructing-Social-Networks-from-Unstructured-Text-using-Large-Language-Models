				On September 1st, when the eighth leaves of the first batch of tobacco seedlings appear, we start the formal experiments of formaldehyde detection. Before that, some pre-tests are made based on some corresponding references. Finding the right amount of formaldehyde is the hardest part. By means of a series of experiments, we determine the final protocol which includes the qualitative detection and quantitative detection. From the experimental results, we can draw the conclusion that our super plants have remarkable formaldehyde tolerance and can dramatically reduce the concentration of formaldehyde in the air.<B>September 1</B>
