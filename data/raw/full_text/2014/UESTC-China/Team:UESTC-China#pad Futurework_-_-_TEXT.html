Give the plants a big mouth
Because of the limited time, we have not cloned the stomatal regulation gene, AtAHA2, to the expression vectoras we planned to. So our next target would be cloning AtAHA2 gene and its promoter, GC1, to the expressing vector, transforming that to plants, and testing their abilities of absorbing formaldehyde.
Chloroplast transformation
The chloroplast is a pivotal organelle in plant cells and eukaryotic algae to carry out photosynthesis, which provides the primary source of the world’s food. The expression of foreign genes in chloroplasts offers several a dvantages over their expression in the nucleus: high-level expression, transgene stacking in operons and a lack of epigenetic interference allowing stable transgene expression. In addition, transgenic chloroplasts are generally not transmitted through pollen grains because of the cytoplasmic localization.  And it meets the requirement of biosafety of iGEM. In the past two decades, great progress in chloroplast engineering has been made. So in the future work, we will tranform the genes into the chloroplast of plants.
More super plants
By now our project is still in its basic research stage. And our experiments was on the model plant, tobacco. In the near future we will try it on some ornamental plants
