Acknowledgement
This year's UESTC-China iGEM team are grateful to the following institutes:
School of Life Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
Office of Educational Administration, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
Office of Students' Affairs, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
Plant Genome Engineering Lab, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
School of Optoelectronic Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
Center of Bioinformatics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
We highly appreciate Professor Yong Zhang for advising us to design our vectors.
We highly appreciate Professor Xuelian Zheng for guding us to do to the experiments in details.
We highly appreciate Professor Lixia Tang for lots of advises to perfect our project.
We feel so lucky for having these three faculty teachers to guide us in this project, and put themselves out away to help us. No nap every Wednesday noon. So no words can convey the gratitude inside us.
We highly appreciate the masters in Plant Genome Engineering Lab for guiding us to do our experiments.
Except for these upon, we especially acknowledge ZhengYang Xie in Plant Genome Engineering lab for providing us with the basic vector of our project, pXZY006. And thank her guidance when doing transformation.
We thank Xu Tang for his general help, such as advise us to design and construct our vector,also he help us to design primer,and guide us to do our experiment.
