Question 8: Where do you think formaldehyde come from?
A. Furniture
B. Oil paint
C. Cosmetics
D. Carpet
E. Automobile exhaust
Conclusion: From these five charts, we found that, people from different places all had the bigger proportion to consider the furniture and oil were the main reason to lead to formaldehyde pollution. And hardly any people knew that formaldehyde could be caused by cosmetics. People from city could better knew the formaldehyde might be brought by automobile exhaust. And cause the small number of the foreigners, so the statistics of people abroad might not be authentic.
Revenue
Question 10: If you buy a new house, which way you prefer to reduce the amount of formaldehyde?
A. Ventilate to fresh the air
B. Plant
C. Activated carbon
D. Photo catalyst
E. Air cleaner
F. Else
Conclusion: From the charts, we could find that almost all the people of different income range chose ventilation to deminish formaldehyde. Few people chose the method of photocatalyst and activated carbon which, as far as I am concerned, is due to the disacquaintance to method.
Question 15: For the plant designed by synthetic biology which absorb formaldehyde, which kind of problem you care more about?
A. The efficiency of absorbing formaldehyde
B. Biological safety
C. Whether it is easy to keep alive
D. The costs to keep plants healthy
Conclusion: Most people care about the security of this "super plant", clearly you can see, when the revenue of people reach six thousands, they care more about the security. And less people of this range care about whether the plant is easy to cultivate. So, that is obvious, when the revenue goes higher, the number of people who care about the biology security go larger. But when the revenue go higher to ten thousands, less people care about the security than the six thousands range, this is mainly due to the deficiency of the data.
Gender
Question 8: Where do you think formaldehyde come from?
A. Furniture
B. Oil paint
C. Cosmetics
D. Carpet
E. Automobile exhaust
Question 10: If you buy a new house, which way you prefer to reduce the amount of formaldehyde?
A. Ventilate to fresh the air
B. Plant
C. Activated carbon
D. Photo catalyst
E. Air cleaner
F. Else
Question 17: If you will go to buy the very product to get rid of formaldehyde, which two of the following options you care more?
A. Portability
B. Safety
C. Efficiency
D. Price
Question 18: If you would buy this product, where would you prefer to buy?
A. Supermarket
B. Online shopping
C. Building materials market
D. Stall
Conclusion: From all the charts giving above, we can make these conclusions as follows:
1. We found that the difference of gender did not cause the different view of the sources of the formaldehyde. Most people hold the idea that formaldehyde comes from paints and furniture.
2. The difference of gender do not cause the different view to diminish the formaldehyde. Most people hold the idea that the best way to diminish formaldehyde is ventilation and green plants.
3. We found that most people care about the biological security and uptake efficiency of de-formaldehyde products.
4. Over half people tend to buy the products in supermarket and nearly no people chose to buy the products on the roadside stalls.
Education
9. Which drawback do you know about formaldehyde?
A. Stimulate the skin mucous membrane
B. Acute poisoning (difficult to breathe)
C. Chronic hazard (lower immunity, sleepy, feeble)
D. Carcinogenic (multiple myeloma, leukemia)
E. Allergic dermatitis
Conclusion: From these five charts, we could find that when the education go higher, more people see the allergic dermatitis could be brought by formaldehyde. Nevertheless, almost all the people in different educational range hold the idea that formaldehyde can lead to cancer.
13. Which application you think belongs to synthetic biology or genetic engineering?
A. Biosensor
B. Synthetic insulin, vaccine
C. Microbes which can decompose oil
D. Hybrid rice
Conclusion: From these charts above you can see, almost all the people do not know the application of the synthetic biology or genome engineering because hybrid rice is not an application in synthetic biology. And the post-graduates seem to be more familiar with the synthetic biology than the people in other  range.
14. What effects you think that synthetic biology or genetic engineering bring to human being?
A. High yield of grain
B. Lower drug costs
C. Improve the environment
D. No influence
Conclusion: People in different range hold the same idea that, synthetic biology play a role in our life, and this influence can be categorized into three aspects. These are higher yield of rice, lower cost of the drugs, and improvement of our environment.
15. For the plant designed by synthetic biology which absorb formaldehyde, which kind of problem you care more about?
A. The efficiency of absorbing formaldehyde
B. Biological safety
C. Whether it is easy to keep alive
D. The costs to keep plants healthy
Conclusion: People in different range all care more about the biological security and the efficiency of absorbing formaldehyde than other sides.
