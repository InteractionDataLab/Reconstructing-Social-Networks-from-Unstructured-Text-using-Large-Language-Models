Vedio
In order to make our project easier to understand for others, we made a video. Using white board and an old iron stand from the chemistry lab (to hold the camera). Surprisingly it was a quiet tiring job. Everyone in the lab had to place the camera because they were tied of watching Roxanne awkwardly getting her way to the iron stand which was too high for her. After autograph we putted it online, first on our school webset, the school TV channel, and then youku（kind of like Chinese version of YouTube)， for more people to watch. Hope the cartoon and story may get more people into synthetic biology. Please watch and enjoy！
