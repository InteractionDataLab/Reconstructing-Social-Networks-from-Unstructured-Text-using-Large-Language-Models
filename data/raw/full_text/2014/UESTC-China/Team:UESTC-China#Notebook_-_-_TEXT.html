Site: West 304 of main building in UESTC
Group meeting;
Decide to build the second vector piGEM002.
Ligate F05, F02, and F03 to piGEM001 to construct piGEM002;
Ligate F06, F07 to piGEM002 to construct piGEM011.

September
September 1 to now
Site: West 121 of main building in UESTC
On September 1st, when the eighth leaves of the first batch of tobacco seedlings appear, we start the formal experiments of formaldehyde detection. Before that, some pre-tests are made based on some corresponding references. Finding the right amount of formaldehyde is the hardest part. By means of a series of experiments, we determine the final protocol which includes the qualitative detection and quantitative detection. From the experimental results, we can draw the conclusion that our super plants have remarkable formaldehyde tolerance and can dramatically reduce the concentration of formaldehyde in the air.

We caught this opportunity to advertise iGEM and our ultimate products, the plants which can absorb formaldehyde. The leaders and many teachers in our school also participated this activity. We displayed the plants which already owned the several genes which worked in the absorption of formaldehyde, to the people who visited our project. And the people visited our plant all said they want to owe one if there is already market available.
