Overview
On July 25th 2014, the iGEM team SCU-China from SiChuan University went to our school and communicate with us. We exchanged our project to each other. We leaded them visit our lab, we talked about the school life in our school respectively. The number of people from SCU is 6, and we have a big lunch at noon.
nap chat at the outer room of lab
we sit together to chat, and briefly talk about our project and experimental schedule. They were astonished that we chose plant as our target, cause the lifecycle of plant is a little bit long. And they said they chose microorganism as targeted object.
visit of our lab
After the chatting, we led them visit our incubator room where reposed our transformed tobacco. We introduce the transformed tobacco to them, and briefly give an account of the experimental schedule of our project. We all felt a little bit nervous if we can finish our project at the end of September.
