Video
In order to make our project easier to understand for others, we made a video, using white board and an old iron stand from the chemistry lab (to hold the camera). Surprisingly it was a quite tiring job. Everyone in the lab had to place the camera because they were tied of watching Roxanne awkwardly getting her way to the iron stand which was too high for her. After autograph we putted it online, first on our school website, the school TV channel, and then youku（kind of like Chinese version of YouTube), for more people to watch. Hope the cartoon and story may get more people into synthetic biology. Please watch and enjoy!

Art
Besides from biology, another thing that I have my passion for is art. It's so exciting to do both Sythetic Biology and Art in this iGEM game.
Long before we did our experiment, when we were doing our questionaire to find out if people really need genetic modified plants to deal with HCHO, I thought we should use a panda as our LOGO because it is one of the most typical animals of Sichuan Province. I draw several different editions for our team members to choose.
When we finally decided that we should make a plant to reduce in-door HCHO, everyone was quiet happy about our mascot. "It can means Kun Fu Panda, too. You know, beat HCHO as a hero." One of our members said. One day I walked into our lab, it was putted up on our fridge.
“It makes us more like a team.” our team leader said.
“My team members love it.” I thought, “Maybe I should let more people get interested with our mascot first, and then our project. ” So I made some poster about knowledge about iGEM, with pandas on them, which was checked out by a lot of people.
For our member, I got laboratory notebooks in the same theme to encourage them.
Then I draw pictures about our theme”Plants vs HCHO”.
Also, I draw diagrammatics, our T-shirts with our mascot.
