Overview
On April 29th, iGEM team UESTC-China went into the Seventh Middle School of ChengDu to disseminate iGEM competition and introduce the subject of our team to them, at the same time, we resolve the qualms the senior high school students have about the synthetic biology. Meantime, they ask questions actively and denote their interest in iGEM.
Give a speech
  This is the picture our teammate ZhiQiang Yan who is giving a speech to the senior high school students of Seventh Middle High School. On the screen you can see the introduction of iGEM. And our teammate is full of energy when giving the speech.
The situation in the lobby.
 Students reposing on the seats are all concentrating on the screen and the speech. The number of students who attend our lecture nearly approach to a thousand. They also ask questions actively. You can see some people take notes. All the phenomena denote that they are interested in iGEM.
After the speech
 students did not leave immediately. They surrounded our team leader to ask him more about iGEM and what we were going to do. They thought highly of iGEM as well as our project. They believed that there must be a great perspective in the future
At the end of this lecture.
 In this picture our teammates took a group photo to mark the occasion. We wore our team costume as a symbol of our team. We can see the sweet smile on the senior high school students' faces. To summarize this activity into one sentence, it will be  'Let  iGEM  be part of our community'.
