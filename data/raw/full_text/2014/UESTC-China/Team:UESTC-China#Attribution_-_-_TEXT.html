Acknowledgement
This year's UESTC-China iGEM team are grateful to the following institutes:
School of Life Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
Office of Educational Administration, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
Office of Students' Affairs, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
Plant Genome Engineering Lab, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
Protein Engineering Lab, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

Center of Bioinformatics, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
We highly appreciate iGEM foundation and all the faculty in this competition. After this competition, we gain a lot, such as the cooperation between the team, capability of scientific thinking and etc. We enjoy the game and keep improving.
We highly appreciate Professor Yong Zhang for advising us to design our vectors.
We highly appreciate Professor Xuelian Zheng for guding us to do to the experiments in details.
We highly appreciate Professor Lixia Tang for lots of advises to perfect our project.
We feel so lucky for having these three faculty teachers to guide us in this project, and put themselves out away to help us. No naps every Wednesday noon. So no words can convey the gratitude inside us.
We highly appreciate the masters in Plant Genome Engineering Lab for guiding us to do our experiments.
Except these showed above, we especially acknowledge Zhengyang Xie in Plant Genome Engineering lab for providing us with the basic vector of our project, pXZY006. And thank her guidance when doing transformation.
We thank Xu Tang for his general help, such as advising us to design and constructing our vector, also he helped us to design primer, and guided us to do our experiment.
We also thank Weihai Liu for his technical support in website construction, he helped us to solve several key problems in building our wiki.
Besides, we highyly aknowledge the following people who also do some critical help for our project. Mingyuan Wang, Manni Zhang, Xu Zhao, Kaiyue Zhang, Mengyuan Lv, Xi Lin, Shuangyi Xie, Lu Hou.
At the end, we highyly acknowledge every one who helps and cares us. We couldn't get accomplishment now without your efforts and support. Thank you very much!
