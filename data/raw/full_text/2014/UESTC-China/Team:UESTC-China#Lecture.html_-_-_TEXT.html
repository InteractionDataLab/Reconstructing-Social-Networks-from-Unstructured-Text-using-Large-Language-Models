Lecture
On April 29th, iGEM team UESTC-China went into the Seventh Middle School of Chengdu to disseminate iGEM competition and introduced the subject of our project, at the same time, we resolved the qualms senior high school students had about the synthetic biology. Meantime, they asked questions actively and denoted their interest in iGEM.
A lecture of iGEM
This is the picture our teammate Zhiqiang Yan giving a speech to the senior high school students of Seventh Middle High School. On the screen you can see the introduction of iGEM. From the picture, you can also catch that the speaker is full of energy when giving the speech.
Students in the lobby
Students reposing on the seats were all concentrating on the screen and speech. The number of students who attended our lecture nearly approach to a thousand. They asked questions actively. You could also see some people taking notes from the picture. All the phenomena denoted that they were interested in iGEM.
After the lecture
Students did not leave immediately after the lecture given by ZhiQiang Yan. They surrounded our team leader trying to acquire more details about iGEM and what we were going to do for our project. They thought highly of iGEM as well as our project and wished a great perspective in the future.
A picture containing students and our team
In this picture our teammates took a group photo to mark this occasion. We wore our team costume as a symbol of our team. You can notice the sweet smile on the senior high school students' faces. If it has to summarize this lecture into one sentence, it would be 'Let iGEM be part of our community' as the banner showed.
