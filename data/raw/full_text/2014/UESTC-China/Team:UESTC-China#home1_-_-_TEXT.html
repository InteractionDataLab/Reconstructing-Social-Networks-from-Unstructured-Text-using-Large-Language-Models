Introduction
As the rapid economic development in China, the residential conditions of people have been greatly improved. Unfortunately, the potential harm of their indoor decoration was always neglected until people get sick. One of the most harmful gases of the indoor pollution could be the formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is a toxic gas appears in every single room which is newly decorated. It not only has bad smell, but also cause various of desease, like skin and mucous membrane irritation, immunity or memory decline, drowsiness, fatigue, cancer, allergic dermatitis. To decrease the concentration of HCHO, we got air purifier, physical adsorption, negative air ions, photocatalyst pathway and etc. We thought that the biological methods is the best. It's delicate, it's simple, and it's safe. Therefore, we decided to cultivate a plant which got the ability to metabolize the formaldehyde. Actually, all kinds of plants can degrade the formaldehyde, but we decide to make their formaldehyde degradation system works better. In the future,we sincerely chrish the hope that our work will be put to use in our everyday life.
