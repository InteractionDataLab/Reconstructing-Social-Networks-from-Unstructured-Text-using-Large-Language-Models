Judging Criteria
We are very proud of the many achievements we have made in this summer. Here is a compilation of our feats!
1. We submitted 13 high-quality and well-characterized Standard Biobricks! More details...
2. We improved a previous Biobrick Part, which is a promoter in transgenic plants (BBa_K414002). We added 6 adenine nucleotides and MASS translation which can up regulate downstream gene expression. The improved version of the Biobrick is BBa_K1537015 .
3. We improved a previous Biobrick Part, which is a a self-processing connecting peptide (BBa_K1199045). We added a GSG linker between your protein and 2A peptide to enhance cleavage. The improved version of the biobrick is BBa_ K1537016 and BBa_K1537017 .
4. Our project involved an important question beyond the bench, that is what people think of indoor pollution such as formaldehyde. We  conducted a questionnaire survey, and we had in-depth discussion about how people remove indoor formaldehyde and what is the most important when they choose the method to remove indoor faldehyde. This is the basic of our project. More details...
5. We have cultivated transgenic tobaccoes using synthetic biology which were given stronger ability of absorbing and metabolizing formaldehyde. More details...
6. We gave a big lecture about synthetic biology to a middle school in Sichuan Chengdu. And we aroused their curiosity about synthetic biology and they decided to take part in iGEM high school completion. More details...
7. We had a good communication with iGEM team from Sichuan Univerisity and we shared a lot of experience in the summer. More details...
