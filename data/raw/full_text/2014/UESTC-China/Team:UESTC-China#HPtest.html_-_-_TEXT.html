Team set up
Our iGEM-China team was founded in April 3, on this special day we hold a meeting to record this important moment. The leadership of our school attend to this meeting, and denote that our school will spare no effort to support our iGEM project. At the first, we only have three members. Until now, we got nine members, two advisors and three instructors. Besides of them, we also get some help from the seniors.
April 29
A lecture to the seventh middle school.
On April the 29th , our team members went to the seventh middle school of Chengdu to disseminate iGEM and our project. The seventh middle school of Chengdu is the best high school in Chengdu city. Almost everybody in Sichuan province heard about it. We introduce iGEM to them, may get more fresh vitality to iGEM and the area of synthetic biology. This lecture had a perfect end. Students in the seventh middle school express high warmth in this international competition.

On June 16th , to advertise iGEM and our team to Chinese students we held a activity named knowledge quiz ,which took place in the center of students’ activity. And the students passed by can answer two of the questions and if them answered with the right answer then he can get a delicate gift which we bought as a incentive.
August
Questionnaires
In August , 2014, our team make a questionnaire to investigate people in every stratum and in every occupation to get the information how much does the people in different range know about iGEM or the pollution formaldehyde produce. The making of questionnaires is difficult, because you do not know the extent of how much people understand about synthetic biology. When distributing the questionnaires we do find this issue, people walking on the street rarely knows about biology, let alone synthetic biology. But we do hope they can hear about synthetic biology no matter how little they get.
