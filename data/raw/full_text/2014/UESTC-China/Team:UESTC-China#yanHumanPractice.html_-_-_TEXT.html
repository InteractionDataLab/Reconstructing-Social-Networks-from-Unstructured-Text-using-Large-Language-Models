Overview
This year , UESTC-China 2014 IGEM has been working on the problem of formaldehyde,we try to use the principle of synthetic biology to make a plant to absorb formaldehyde largely.
First,we conducted a knowledge quiz activity to popularize IGEM,and let more Chinese know the competition,and drawed their attract on synthetic biology.To crystallize the goal,we bought many liitle gifts such as delicate plants,cartoon fans for the people who joined in our activity and did a good job.
Then,we drawed up a questionnaire survey to gather the information of public awareness of synthetic biology and the population of formaldehyde,and last but no least,their perspective on the trangenetic plant which can absorb formaldehyde,if they mind this man-made thing.
Also,we do a on-the-spot research in many residential district,where the houses are furbishing,so the formaldehyde pollution is relatively critical.
Last,we analized ur research data,and come to a conclusion of our activity,and made many charts or diagrams to make people easy understand.In addition to these above,we also communicate with other IGEM teams,such as USTC-China ,HZAU-China ,etc.
knowledge quiz activity
 The two in our fisrt sight are our team leader Yasong Cui (the right) and our wiki Zhiqiang Yan(the left),you can see the smile on their face. And both in their hands hold our cartoon fans and delicate plant which are used as little gifts for this activity.Behind of them is our activity's banner.
we bought cartoon fans and plants as incentive
 Our team members are packing our little gifts for the activity. we bought 200 cartoon fans and 30 green plants as incentive to attract people who are passing by. If the person who answer our questions then he can own a cartoon fan, if he answer two questions then he may win a pot of plant .
the olds are also attracted by the activity
 The olds are also interested in our activity. In this picture you can see the old ask our team member question. The slip of paper in their hands is our question. And by the paper question, passers-by can be more eligible about IGEM and our team's project. And meantime, the activity here attracts more and more people to join in.
We take a picture as a souvenir
 After this activity, all the member of us took a photo as a souvenir. Everyone looks enjoyed in this photo. And at the moment of shuttle click, we cheered. The leader said, we got it, this activity end perfectly. As the banner's going,hope the leaves bring you some green in June.

And by the paper question, passers-by can be more eligible about IGEM and our team's project. And meantime, the activity here attracts more and more people to join in.
One of the winner
 You can see more and more people are in our activity, one who took part in this activity then asked their friends to attend. And you can see the countenance on the girl's face ,which is so devoted. She has already win the first part, and now she answers the second part.
the girl win one pot of plant
 When the activity is ending , people who answer the questions accurately gain one pot of our plant, the lovely girl in the picture is one of them.She said she was satisfied with our activity, and after this activity she had learned more about biology ,further more,she also learned something about the IGEM campaign.
the winners
 When the activity is ending , people who answer the questions accurately gain one pot of our plant, the lovely girl in the picture is one of them.They thought they had learned a lot about synthetic biology. They all felt satisfied with our little gifts.One of them also said,she wanna visit our lab to see this imagical plant which can absorb formaldehyde largely.
