This page will give you a run down on the modelling we did for the project.  It's a bit mechanics heavy, but we hope we can explain the concepts to you in an uncomplicated manner.
Basically, what we wanted to do was model the effects the gas vesicles had on the movement of the bacteria – both with and without flagella.  Would the swimming bacteria fight against the buoyancy the gas vesicles provide?
How fast will the bacteria float up?  Will forming a filament or cluster make them float faster, slower, or not at all?  Let's find out!
Before we start, here's a quick run down on the mechanics terminology –  and if you know this already, here's a wee refresher course.
It should help a lot with the understanding of the next bit, but feel free to carry on to the main modelling section right now.
