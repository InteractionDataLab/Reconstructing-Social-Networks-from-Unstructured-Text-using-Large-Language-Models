Our Artwork - The Story of Wilkins
Background
The comic strip was born during our first Outreach event's preparations: how could we make our poster bright and appealing to a younger audience?  This resulted in the simple retelling of our project's concept, with our bacterium protagonist pushing the "switch" to gain chemical-absorbing superpowers.  For the older viewers, and those more knowledgeable in biology, a number of subtle science references were incorporated (see if you can spot them!).
At the events, we found that children were keen to read and learn more about the drawings. The strip also served as an excellent visual aid for outlining our concept to the old and young alike.
As for us... well, we liked Wilkins so much we made him our team mascot!
