The squad: Ready to roll.
“Kids, I’m gonna tell you an incredible story…
Once upon a time, in the rainy and stormy hills of the mysterious town in the north, called Gothenburg, there was a group of a few brave and fearless scientists gathering around a table in the sacred halls of wisdom, known as the Chalmers University of Technology. Though extremely busy, they decided to seize a challenge they’ve never faced before. In the beginning it seemed that the participation might remain a thought experiment, a theoretical journey through the depths of one of biotechnologies newest fields. Only after a serious round of recruitments the team was established in the form it exists now.“
Our team reflects the diversity of the iGEM competition, not only in one way. From the total amount of ten members, five of us are not Swedish but come from different nations, including Brazil, India, Hungary, Italy and Germany. During the time of the project, we were all studying at Chalmers in the Systems and Synthetic Biology Group in the Department for Chemical and Biological Engineering. Additionally, half of the team is at undergraduate level, giving everybody the unique opportunity to learn and help each other in many different ways.
Since we all were newbies in the iGEM competition, we relied a lot on the experience and competence of our supervisors. All three of our “masters” participated in different teams and advised us as much as possible.
