Safety Instructions
The team received mandatory safety training and general lab routine information.
A really cool video about Chalmers' chemical safety routine (recorded at our very own lab!) can be seen in http://www.chalmers.se/insidan/EN/about-chalmers/environmental-work/policies/chemical-safety-routine

Introduction to centrifuges and autoclaves
As a part of the mandatory training required by the SysBio group, the team received instructions on how to operate the centrifuges       and autoclaves of the labs.
We also worked on our risk declaration; a mandatory document containing our experiments descriptions and information about the chemicals we are going to use, their handling, storage and associated risk, as well as waste handling.

Finished mandatory training
Our Risk Declaration was approved by the lab manager and our supervisors. We also sign a safety certificate stating that we are aware       of the safety instructions and with that, completed the mandatory "check-in list for new incomers" of the lab.

Cleaved the plasmids p413TEF, p414TEF, p415TEF and p416TEF by using the enzymes SacI and XbaI.
Approximately 500ng of each plasmid was mixed with o.5UL of SacI, 0.5UL of XbaI, 2UL of FastDigest buffer, 1UL of FastAP        (alkaline phosphatase) and up to 20 UL of deionized sterile water.
This reaction mixture was incubated at in a water bath at 37ºC for 10 minutes and then enzymatic inactivation was performed for 5min in a heating block at 60ºC.
Samples were loaded into a gelGreen, that showed p413, p415 and p416 approximately in the 5000bp size band, while p414 presented two bands, one around 4000bp and another at 2000bp.
this indicates that the 5000bp band corresponds to the uncut plasmid, while the 4000bp and 2000bp are probably contaminations.

Approximately 500ng of the plasmid was mixed with o.5UL of SacI, 0.5UL of XbaI, 2UL of FastDigest buffer, 1UL of FastAP        (alkaline phosphatase) and up to 20 UL of deionized sterile water. Control tubes containing just one of the enzymes each were also prepared.
This reaction mixture was incubated at in a water bath at 37ºC for 10 minutes and then enzymatic inactivation was performed for 5min in a heating block at 60ºC.
A diagnostic gelGreen was performed and showed multiple size bands for the samples treated with XbaI. Consultation to the literature showed that this enzyme has not an unique restriction site for p414.
Therefore the restriction was repeated with the enzyme SpeI, that has an unique cleavage site in p414 located 6bp away from the XbaI's desirable cleavage site. The same procedure described above was used, substituting XbaI for SpeI.
The disgnostic gel performed on this second cleavage showed correct band sizes, but with too low lines. This indicates low concentration of the plasmid, therefore it was not extracted.

Control tubes containing just one of the enzymes each and without phosphatase were also prepared.
This reaction mixture was incubated at in a water bath at 37ºC for 20 minutes and then enzymatic inactivation was performed for 5min in a heating block at 75ºC for samples containing BamHI and at 65ºC for samples containing SpeI.
A diagnostic gelGreen was performed and SacI again seemed to be leaving an excessive amount of uncut plasmid. However, samples treated with SacI and SpeI with and without phosphatase and one of the samples treated with SacI, BamHI and phosphatase seemed to work and were extracted.

Preparation of Competent cells
Observation of the previously transformed cells
One of the plates with cells transformed on the 28th showed growth, but with contamination by filamentous fungi, while the other presented no growth at all.
A single yeast colony from the contaminated plate was replated on a YPD-agar plate.
Plasmid restriction
Cleaved the plasmids p413TEF, p414TEF and p416TEF with the enzymes SacI and XbaI.
Approximately 500ng of the plasmid was mixed with o.5UL of SacI, 0.5UL of XbaI, 2UL of FastDigest buffer, 1UL of FastAP        (alkaline phosphatase) and up to 20 UL of deionized sterile water. Control tubes containing just one of the enzymes each were also prepared.
This reaction mixture was incubated at in a water bath at 37ºC for 30 minutes and then enzymatic inactivation was performed for 5min in a heating block at 65ºC.
A diagnostic gelGreen was performed and showed fragments with the correct sizes.
Gel extraction
Extracted the successfully restricted plasmids with a GeneJet gel extraction kit. The manufacter's instructions were followed, except the elution buffer was subtituted by water on the last step.
