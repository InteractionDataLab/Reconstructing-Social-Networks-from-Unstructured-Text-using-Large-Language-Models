Despite the hard work, long days and persistence of the team, the project would never have come this far without the help, and support, of all the amazing people with whom we have worked together this summer.
Thereby, we first and foremost want to extend our truest gratitude to our supervisors, whose guidance and patience never failed to inspire and aid us in times of need.
Verena Siewers
David Jullesson
Eugene Fletcher
In addition, we are very grateful to Andreas Lindhé who did all of the javascript work for the wiki. Without you, code both visible and invisible would be much uglier (and probably nonfunctional).
We would also like to thank our sponsors. Without them this journey would never have been possible. Big thanks to:
Chalmers University of technology
The Systems and Synthetic Biology group and Jens Nielsen
We also greatly appreciated the questions and opinions, as well as some fun days, from our fellow iGEMers. Thereby we would also like to thank the rest of the Swedish iGEM teams. Many hugs to:
Uppsala University iGEM
Linköping University iGEM
Furthermore, we enjoyed every day in the lab and thus we want to thank all the people whom we have met and talked to throughout the summer. With their help and friendly attitude we were able to feel at home from day one.
Thanks for the cake guys!
