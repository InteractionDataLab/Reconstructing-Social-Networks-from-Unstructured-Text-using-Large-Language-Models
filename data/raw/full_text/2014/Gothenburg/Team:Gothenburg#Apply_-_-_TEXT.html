Interested on iGEM? Great! We from the 2014 Gothenburg team learned a lot from this experience, had a lot of fun over the summer and certainly recommend it to everybody that is interested in Synthetic Biology. Still not sure what Synthetic Biology really is? Then watch the video below:
What is Synthetic Biology?
There is a 7.5 credits course at the Biotechnology Master programme in Chalmers University of Technology associated with iGEM (KBT225 - Synthetic Biology - development of an iGEM project).
To get more information about iGEM at Chalmers, please contact Verena Siewers (siewers@chalmers.se) or David Jullesson (davidju@chalmers.se).
