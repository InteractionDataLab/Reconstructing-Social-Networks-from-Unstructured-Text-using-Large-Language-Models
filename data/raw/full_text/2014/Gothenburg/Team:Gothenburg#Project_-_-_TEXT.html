Project Description
Nowadays the determination of replicative age of yeast cells is done by     counting the budding scars of each cell in a microscope, a process time consuming    and not effective. Our team goal with the iGEM project is to construct a yeast    generation counter. The idea is that each time the cell divides a different    florescent protein [1, 2] is produced. Therefore by examining the cell under a    microscope or in a flow cytometer one can determine how many times the cell has    divided. This would be achieved by constructing a logical AND gate in the cell [3]    where the input signals consist of a cyclin activated dCas9-VP64 and a guide RNA    (gRNA) [4] signal from the previous cell cycle. The output response consist of a    different fluorescent protein and a new gRNA molecule, see figure 1.

dCas9-VP64 is an engineered turntable transcription factor only active when dimerized    with an interchangeable gRNA molecule. The gRNA also determines the specificity of     the transcription factor which enables the dCas9-VP64 to activate different genes     depending on the sequence of the gRNA molecule and the promoter. gRNA consists of two    parts, a scaffold and a 20 bp Specificity Determinant Sequence (SDS) on the 5' end.     The scaffold constitutes the majority of the gRNA molecule and gives it its structure     whereas the SDS binds to the target site in the gene promoter.  Cyclins are proteins     that are involved in the progression of the cell cycle, therefore activated at specific    times [5]. To mimic the specific production pattern of cyclins the dCas9-VP64 gene is    placed under the control of a yeast cyclin promoter. Therefore the Cas9 will be     produced in the G1 phase. When the Cas9 and gRNA dimerize and the transcription factor     is activated, it in turn activates the transcription of a new fluorescent protein and     a new gRNA molecule to act as a memory for the next cycle. Once this age counter is     implemented, it would be possible to sort cells according to their replicative age     automatically with a flow cytometer device.

Conclusions
It's important for teams to describe all the creativity that goes into an iGEM project, along with   all the great ideas your team will come up with over the course of your work.
It's also important to clearly describe your achievements so that judges will know what you tried   to do and where you succeeded. Please write your project page such that what you achieved is easy    to distinguish from what you attempted.
