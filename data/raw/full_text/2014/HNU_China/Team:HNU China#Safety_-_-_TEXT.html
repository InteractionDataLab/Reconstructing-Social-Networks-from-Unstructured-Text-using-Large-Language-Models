Safety
For the biosafety reason, we would attach apoptosis system to ensure the engineering fungus shall not raise biological contamination.
Apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) is a highly coordinated cellular suicide program. Caspases, cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases are a family of cysteine proteases that play essential roles in apoptosis. In previous studies in yeast, only the over-expression of caspase 8 led to cell death while the over-expression of caspase 3 was not lethal and only retarded yeast growth. In our design, the apoptosis related protein expresses when exposed to the blue light. Totally dark is harsh to fulfill in the industrial practicing, and urge us put the possibility of expression leakage into consideration, when the toxity of caspase may interfere the iron uptaking. Hence, we choose caspase-3, instead of caspase-8, as the apoptosis trigger[fig.1].
