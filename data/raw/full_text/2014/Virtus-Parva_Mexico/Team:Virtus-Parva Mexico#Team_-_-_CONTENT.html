I have found in Nanobiotech an amazing tool which I aim to use and develop in order to create novel therapeutics, and more effective drug delivery systems.
I am Virtus-Parva's Team leader, and the responsible for wanting to be a part of iGEM. It is a dream I shared with my friends, and we've all together made it possible. 
My vision of the world involves all disciplines working together towards a deeper understanding of ourselves and what surrounds us, creating knowledge but never seeking for absolute truths.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR><TR><DIV class="col-md-6"><TD><CENTER><DIV class="col-md-6"><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H1 id="AMA"><CENTER><FONT color="#666666">Abraham Mauleon Amieva</FONT></CENTER></H1></DIV><DIV class="panel-body"><P align="justify"><FONT size="4">Hi, my name is Abraham Mauleon Amieva. I'm twenty two, and I'm from the State of Puebla, Mexico. I'm studying the last semester of the degree in Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering, at Universidad de las Américas Puebla (UDLAP). My personal interest in Nanobiotechnology is the research of novel complex materials. Hence my contribution within Virtus-Parva, for our 2014 iGEM project, was the idea of using biomaterials coupled with magnetic particles for the manufacture of biocompatible, magnetically controlled devices. Besides my scientific formation, I'm currently the President of the Civic Youth Council of Puebla; one of my main goals is the scientific diffusion among youth in the city.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></CENTER></TD></DIV></TR><TR><TD><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-6"><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H1 id="THC"><CENTER><FONT color="#666666">Tania Hidalgo Castillo</FONT></CENTER></H1></DIV><DIV class="panel-body"><P align="justify"><FONT size="4">Yo! I’m Tania Hidalgo, a kind-of-crazy vegetarian studying her 7th semester of the Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering bachelor, even though people think I’m an Arts major. I’ve participated in research regarding the inorganic part of chemistry, so biotechnology and synthetic biology is a new field that I’m exploring with my teammates. I’m interested in using these to explore bioremediation and apply my chemist formation to deal with environmental issues. My love for science is shared with photography, stringed instruments, animals and beer. 
The participation in the iGEM competition has granted me an opportunity to continue my learning experience and to collaborate with my friends to make something awesome (like our beautiful magnetite nanoparticles). I hope with this my family and friends finally know what I’m studying and what I’m passionate about.</FONT></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR><TR><TD><DIV class="col-md-6"><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H1 id="SST"><CENTER><FONT color="#666666">Sabás Sánchez Tellechea</FONT></CENTER></H1></DIV><DIV class="panel-body"><P align="justify"><FONT size="4">I’m Sabás Sánchez Tellechea, I’m 22 years old and I’m from Hermosillo, Sonora México.
