From 2014.igem.org
Virtus Parva
This space is destined to every person
who granted us their support in this project,
all of them in different fashion. It is not
possible to name everyone involved. Yet,
they all contributed to the growth and
development of this project
Our Advisors
Dr. Jose Sanchez Salas: our main instructor, our biological instructor, who was always patient and taught us plenty in the span of a couple of months. We were daily in the microbiology lab, continuing with our experiment and consulting with him, in order to advance in our project on the correct path.
Dr. Miguel Angel Méndez Rojas: our instructor, supporter and main aid when it came to the inorganic portion of our project and kept our feet on the ground. Most of the time spent in this lab was towards the beginning of our project, for the synthesis of our magnetite.
Dr. Ruben Alejos Palomares: our instructor and biggest help when it came to modeling, without whom we would have been lost. Modelling was able to be completed thanks to the class Dr. Alejos taught, MEMS, and being widely available outside of classroom hours for consulting.
