From 2014.igem.org
Virtus Parva
The Power of Small
Who are we?
Virtus-Parva is a team of Nanotechnology students who aim to create a better world
through love,sympathy and endearment… and through the design and development
of a novel technology based on micrometric “drills”.

Meet the Team
Despite all of us being nanotechnologists, we are very different people with, of course, very different interests.Here are all of the team's members beautiful faces, with a short description to tell you a little bit about ourselves.So please, go ahead and get to know us!
Andrea Díaz Gaxiola
Passionate, extrovert, a multi-tasker, an always busy girl, my name is Andrea Díaz Gaxiola. Age: twenty two, and one year far from graduating from nanotechnology's bachelor.  I have found in Nanobiotech an amazing tool which I aim to use and develop in order to create novel therapeutics, and more effective drug delivery systems.
I am Virtus-Parva's Team leader, and the responsible for wanting to be a part of iGEM. It is a dream I shared with my friends, and we've all together made it possible.
My vision of the world involves all disciplines working together towards a deeper understanding of ourselves and what surrounds us, creating knowledge but never seeking for absolute truths.
Abraham Mauleon Amieva
Hi, my name is Abraham Mauleon Amieva. I'm twenty two, and I'm from the State of Puebla, Mexico. I'm studying the last semester of the degree in Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering, at Universidad de las Américas Puebla (UDLAP). My personal interest in Nanobiotechnology is the research of novel complex materials. Hence my contribution within Virtus-Parva, for our 2014 iGEM project, was the idea of using biomaterials coupled with magnetic particles for the manufacture of biocompatible, magnetically controlled devices. Besides my scientific formation, I'm currently the President of the Civic Youth Council of Puebla; one of my main goals is the scientific diffusion among youth in the city.
Tania Hidalgo Castillo
Yo! I’m Tania Hidalgo, a kind-of-crazy vegetarian studying her 7th semester of the Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering bachelor, even though people think I’m an Arts major. I’ve participated in research regarding the inorganic part of chemistry, so biotechnology and synthetic biology is a new field that I’m exploring with my teammates. I’m interested in using these to explore bioremediation and apply my chemist formation to deal with environmental issues. My love for science is shared with photography, stringed instruments, animals and beer.  The participation in the iGEM competition has granted me an opportunity to continue my learning experience and to collaborate with my friends to make something awesome (like our beautiful magnetite nanoparticles). I hope with this my family and friends finally know what I’m studying and what I’m passionate about.
Sabás Sánchez Tellechea
I’m Sabás Sánchez Tellechea, I’m 22 years old and I’m from Hermosillo, Sonora México. I’m a student of the 9th semester of the Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering degree at the Universidad de las Américas Puebla (UDLAP). My involvement within the project isn’t limited to laboratory work, it extends to the genesis of the idea to use a resonant structure guided by a magnetic nanoparticle and the research to find biocompatible materials for the construction of the device. My interests in science and nanotechnology embraces the creation of new materials trying to solve the new needs of society, the efficient use of renewable energies and the pursuit of treatments for genetic syndromes.
Diego Rosas Villalva
As a nanotechnologist, I am fascinated by the way nanostructures can boost energy conversion and storage as well as bioremediation, but as a human I want to increase quality of life and access to information for people, leading me to participate in all kind of projects, giving the best of me. My name is Diego Rosas, I was born in the city of Puebla and I’m in my senior year of nanotechnology’s bachelor at Universidad de las Américas Pueba. I’ve participated in research regarding solar energy and photocatalysis. As a member of Virtus Parva I've synthesized the inorganic part of the project, now I am focused on bionanotechnology diffusion and mathematical modeling. Currently, I am starting a project on electrospun nanofibers for wound dressing, hoping to work in partnership with a local hospital.
Armando Morín Martínez
Hi! Enthusiast and always willing to lend a hand, My name is Armando, I currently am 22 years of age, and I’m native from the state of Coahuila, México. Studying the 9th semester of the nanotechnology and molecular engineering baccalaureate at the University of the Americas Puebla (UDLAP). Within the team I am envolved in the organization of Human Practices, as well as starring in the play Copenhage, interpreting the physicist Werner Heisenberg. My inclination towards synthetic biology lies in my growing interest towards the comprehension, mimicry, and incorporation of microscopic organic mechanisms that could be exploited by mankind. This in order to achieve a better adaptation into our ever changing Mother Nature without procuring harm to it and improving our quality of life.
Tamara Saitcevsky Parra
Hi! I’m Tamara, a slightly grumpy and always-in-the-mood-for-candy, 7th semester Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering student at Universidad de las Américas Puebla. Among other things I love a good raspberry cheesecake, a gripping fantasy fiction book and a bright, sunny day.  Born and raised in Mexico City, my academic interests lie in molecular biology and the dissemination of science. Within my team I have been in charge of keeping a written record of our progress and to process this information in order to give back to our community. From this experience I have learned plenty on organization, teamwork and the importance of communication for even the smallest of tasks.
Instructors
Ideas are just thoughts, if we don't make them tangible. These three wise men, helped us throughout the process in order to make our ideas, a reality.
Dr. José Luis Sánchez Salas
Graduated 1986 in Pharmaco-biological Chemistry from Universidad Autónoma de Puebla, his Master’s degree at the same school in Science with a specialty in Microbiology and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry at Health Center at the University of Connecticut in 1994. During his life as an investigator he has dedicated to the study of the germination of Bacilus subtilis and the differencial expression of the virulent genes of Entramoeba hystolica. He has participated in 32 national congresses and 36 international congresses and has been in three different international research programs. He is currently teacher ar UDLAP and is a member of the American Society of Microbiology and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.
Dr. Miguel Ángel Méndez Rojas
Born in Mexico City in 1973, he graduated Summa Cum Laude in Chemistry at Universidad de las Américas Puebla, he later obtained his Ph.D. in Chemistry at Texas Christian University. Since 2003, he has been a full-time teacher at UDLAP. His interests are focused onto the study of coordination chemistry in molecules that could be of interest in pharmacy and biology with transition metals and heavy metals and is currently working of the study of toxicity of nanomaterials amongst others. Author of over 56 scientific publications in international magazines, 14 diffusion articles, 5 chapters in books and a translator of a chemistry divulgation book. He is currently member of the National System of Investigators, level II, since 2013..
Dr. Rubén Alejos Palomares
Graduated in Electronic Engineering from the Instituto Tecnológico de Minatitlán in 1987, he further obtained his Master’s degree and Ph.D. in Sciences with a Specialty in Electronics from the Instituto Nacional de Astofísica, Óptica y Electrónica in 1990 and 1999 respectively. His interest lie in measuring systems, control and design of intelligent systems and is in the middle of projects for creating new instruments for medical diagnosis and the development of prosthesis. He has been the author of over 100 scientific articles and has worked over the years as a consultant for several companies working with the automatization and control of machines.
