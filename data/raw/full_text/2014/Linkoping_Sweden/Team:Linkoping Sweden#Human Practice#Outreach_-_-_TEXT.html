Outreach
Two of our team members traveled to Uppsala to present our project and the iGEM competition to Thermo-Fischer Scientific's employees in the form of an open seminar (Fig. 1 & 2). Anyone interested was allowed to attend, and the seminar room was packed with curious Thermo-Fischer Scientific employees. We got wonderfully positive feedback and it was great fun to spread information about iGEM and our project. Sigma-Aldrich had two representatives travel to our University where we held a joint-seminar for the Chemistry Institution about iGEM, our project, and an exciting new technique within Synthetic Biology that Sigma-Aldrich has developed (Fig. 3). Great exchange of knowledge for all!

Finally, it was very important for us to spread knowledge about Synthetic Biology and the possibilities within this area of research to a younger generation. Therefore we teamed up with our University and joined other researchers at our "Popular Science Week" hosted here in Linköping. High School students are invited to attend this week of presentations to get a better understanding about different science subjects. Naturally LiU iGEM 2014 was there to inspire young and bright minds to continue down the path of science!
