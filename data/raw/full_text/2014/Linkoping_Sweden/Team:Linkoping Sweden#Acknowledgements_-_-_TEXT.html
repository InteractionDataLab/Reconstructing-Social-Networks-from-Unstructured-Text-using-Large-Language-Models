ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Aknowledgements
First we would like to thank our generous sponsors for their monetary and material support:
Astma och Allergi Förbundet
For their generous monetary donation to our project.
Thermo Fisher Scientific
For their generous monetary donation, for providing us with monoclonal antibodies specific to Ara h1, and for their very positive and supportive attitude to our project.
Linköping University Institute of Technology
For their monetary support and the generous lending of laboratory locations for our summer labs.
Sigma-Aldrich
For their material donations in the form of PCR kits, restriction enzymes, and other basic laboratory items which have been useful during the wet-lab part of our project.
Handelsbanken
For their monetary donation which has helped send us off to Boston.
We would also like to thank:
Professor Robert Forchheimer
For starting Linköping University's first iGEM back in 2013 and for providing enormous amounts of positive energy and encouragement. Thanks to you we are competing for the second year in a row! We would also like to extend our thanks to both you and your wife Irene for opening your home and kitchen to all three of Sweden's iGEM Teams during our Pre-Jamboree kickoff. The swimming pool was a big hit.
Professor Per Hammarström
For acting as one of our iGEM Team supervisors and an extra brain during brainstorming. Thank you for explaining to us how to conjugate FITC to our monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, and for providing FITC for this conjugation! Your "nothing is impossible" attitude has been an inspiration!
Lecturer Lars-Göran Mårtensson
For also lending your wonderful brain when we needed to brainstorm our ideas. You have been a great mental support as well as providing us with super-competent host E.coli cells and restriction enzymes for digest!
Postdoc Cecilia Andrésen
For being our savior in last-minute situations. You have generously provided us with ethanol when ours ran out and all of our electrocompetent E.coli cells. Your positive attitude and smiling face was always fun to meet during our loooooong lab-filled summer.
And a big thanks to Principal research engineer Sofie Nyström, Alexander Sandberg and all the people we might have forgotten to mention who have given us feedback and who were always invaluable to us for discussions. You guys rock!
We would also like to give a special thanks to:
Lars Svensson for fantastic help with the biosensor! Not much soldering would have been done without you.
CLC Bio for helping us use their software CLC Main Workbench!
To Uppsala and Chalmer's iGEM 2014 Teams for participating in the Swedish Pre-Jamboree held here in Linköping. Your enthusiasm is infectious!
To our team member Emil Olofsson for single-handedly coding our Wiki-Page, you are fantastic!
And to all of the iGEM Teams that have taken the time to answer our International Survey, giving us a better understanding of Peanut Allergies world-wide!
Thank you all for your support, this project would not have been possible without each and every one of you!
