Anna
Borg
Hi! I’m a former graphic designer that picked up an interest in pharmaceutical pathways so I made the decision to re-educate myself. Now I’m on my fifth year in Protein Science at Linkoping University. Originally I come from the swedish holiday resort, Gotland. This is my second year with LiUiGEM. My role this year has been as project leader. Some in the group refer to me as Mum. :)
Emily
Chamberlain
Who am I? I am the X-American! Adding an international flavor to the Linköping iGEM group and a hearty dose of Swenglish. Decided that I wanted to help cure cancer at the age of 14 and haven’t looked back since. “Work hard, work smart”!
Sofie
Cassman
Originally from a town called Gävle in the “northern” part of Sweden (geographically yes, however not really). I didn´t chose biochemistry, biochemistry chose me! In my spare time I like to work out and my Liu-iGEM friends call me “Assman”.
Nariman
Aberkan
I'm a 22-year-old girl, born and raised in Linköping but with roots from Morocco. I have always been a multigirl, being fond of everything and therefor I chose to study chemical biology because it is a program that combines nearly all of the science subjects such as physics, chemistry and biology.
Lisa
Bransell
My name is Lisa and I am originally from Uppsala, the fourth largest city of Sweden. Since my parents are both chemists, I kind of grew up in a laboratory. When I'm not in the lab I practice running or spend my time at the gym. For some unknown reason my iGEM team mates have given me the nickname ”Jerry”.
Maria
Madan
Andersson
My name is Maria Madan-Andersson and I am 22 years old from a little town near the coast, Västervik. I have always been interested in science so chemical biology was an easy choice. During my spare time I like to go to the gym and travel.
Patricia
Gullberg
Hello! I am a 23-year old girl named Patricia but for some strange reason I´m called Patte by my iGEM team mates. I've always had an interest in science so to study chemical biology was the obvious choice for me. On my spare time I like to work out and spend time with friends.
Johannes
Salomonsson
Hi! My name is Johannes Salomonsson, I am from a small town called Boxholm. I decided to study chemical biology because these are two of my favorite subjects. When I’m not studying I listening, playing and creating music of different genres.
Tom
Birgersson
Hejsan. I am the farmer, or at least a farmer’s son, in the group and like cows and big tractors. Biotechnology is a great way to improve agriculture and to solve the problems it creates. I am also a big fan of meat and beer. Between the eating and the drinking some weight lifting is squeezed in.
Louise
Edman
I'm from the town of Norrköping, the city with Swedens oldest fabrics and cloth industry. When I read a book about the complexity of prion-proteins, I decided to pursue a life of chemical biology because of its awesome coolness. In my spare time I paint acrylic-paintings of cats.
Filip
Thorén
I was born in the city of Motala, known for the bicycle race vätternrundan and... (Well that's it)(Its not a surprise if you have not heard of it). My love for science first took root when I was young and it has grown ever since. My main interests are science, nerdy things and learning new things (mostly things related to the first two).
Lovisa
Hemmingsson
I´m from Astrid Lindgren´s hometown Vimmerby, located in the south part of Sweden. I have always been a Chemistry nerd but during a project in Biochemistry in High School I realized that I want to become a scientist. On my spare time I like to have a beer with my friends, work out and go fishing.
Magnus
Refthammar
My name is Magnus Refthammar and I am coming from the southwest of Sweden from a place called Höllviken. All my life I have had the desire to change the world the way I like it and do things my own way, that is why I choose to follow the path of science.
Zen
Dinha
I’m from the west coast of Sweden, a city called Gothenburg. I am an adventurous girl who likes challenges. My inspiration for science was my great teacher seven years ago. I was inspired of what people have accomplished and that there is so much more to discover.
Emil
Olofsson
I come from Umeå, in the (real) northern part of Sweden. I study computer science and have joined this team to help out with this wiki page! In my spare time I like to work on some personal programming project or go out for a hike.
