BILD PÅ PERSON
Mattias Holmqvist
Hailing from Linköping originally, I'm a lazy person by nature who opted not to leave my cosy hometown for my continued studies, instead choosing to stay and study right here. After hearing about iGEM from a high-school friend who had participated in another team, I decided to join Linköping's team for this year's project.
In my spare time I like to fiddle with a plethora of things at an amateur level, from investing to poltics to cooking, but I consider my ”primary” pastime to be reading heaps of classic literature.
“It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.”
