Plasmid Design
The chosen vector for expression is pET29a(+). The pET29a(+) vector has a Kanamycin resistance gene. The expression of an inserted gene is induced by IPTG. In both anchors at the N- and C-terminus the restriction sites for NdeI and SacI were introduced to clone the genes into a pET29a(+) vector. The modified genes were first digested with the restriction enzymes and so was the pET29a(+) vector. ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ) After digestion the genes were ligated into the vector. For the protocol see: Vector Ligation
