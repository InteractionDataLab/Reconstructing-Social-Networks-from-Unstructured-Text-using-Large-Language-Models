Importance of Outreach
Synthetic biology is a relatively new engineering discipline, but has already brought new knowledge, technologies and approaches that result in opportunities and challenges for areas like health, environment and energy. Despite being innovative and highly promising, synthetic biology also raises questions on the matters of ethics, regulation and social impact. The iGEM Team TU Eindhoven 2014 believes being open and transparent about the mechanisms, opportunities but also the challenges of synthetic biology is the correct approach in making synthetic biology known to the general public. For these reasons we have looked for opportunities to explain our project and the essence of synthetic biology to the community. This has resulted in participation in the national meet ups held in the Netherlands, an informal information evening held for the community and press attention for synthetic biology and our project.
Furthermore, on the 2nd of December 2014 we will present the results of our project, just like the other iGEM teams in the Netherlands, at the DSM Biotechnology Center (DBC) in Delft.
We also have a Facebook Page and update frequently on the progress of our project.
