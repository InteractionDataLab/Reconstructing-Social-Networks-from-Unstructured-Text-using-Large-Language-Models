Click Coli: Expanding the Toolbox for Bacteria
iGEM Team TU Eindhoven 2014 focuses on a fundamental problem: the inability of bacteria to survive in harsh environments. As a team, we tried to find a solution for this problem.
Our goal this year in the iGEM competition is to create a new tool for the synthetic biologist’s toolbox; a tool that allows genetically engineered machines to operate inside the human body without causing an immune response. We want to achieve this by combining polymer chemistry and microfluidics to create individually encapsulated bacteria. Want to learn more? Go to our Project Overview !
