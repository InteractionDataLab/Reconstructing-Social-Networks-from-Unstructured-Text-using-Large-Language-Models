iGEM Team TU Eindhoven 2014
Bronze Medal
✔ We have registered our iGEM Team , had a great summer and plan to have a great time at the Giant Jamboree.
✔ We have completed and submitted our Judging Form.
✔ We have created and shared a description of our project using our Wiki and our parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
✔ We are working on our poster and presentation, which will be presented at the Giant Jamboree.
✔ We have documented our Attributions and Acknowlegdements .
✔ We have documented three new BioBricks: BBa K1492000 , BBa K1492001 , BBa K1492002
Silver Medal
✔ All of our new BioBricks work as expected, for more information see our Submitted Part Pages: BBa K1492000 , BBa K1492001 , BBa K1492002 .
✔ We have characterized our two Clickable Outer Membrane Proteins and the Mj tyrRS: COMPx , COMPy and Mj tyrRS .
✔ These parts have been submitted to the iGEM Parts Registry .
✔ The safety aspects of our project and parts can be found on the Biosafety Page and our Kill Switch . The sustainability of our project has been described in our Synergene Project Page .
Gold Medal
✔ We have improved the function and ease-of-use of BBA_K811005 . See the Registry Page of COMPy for more information.
✔ We have described our approach  for creating the Application Scenarios we wrote for the Synergene project of our project.
Collaborations
✔ We collaborated with the Rathenau Institute in the Synenergene project to create techno-moral vignettes and application scenarios of our project.
✔ We collaborated with the Dutch Institute of Health and Environment (RIVM) and the other Dutch iGEM teams to hold discussions on the chances and opportunities of synthetic biology with policy makers.
