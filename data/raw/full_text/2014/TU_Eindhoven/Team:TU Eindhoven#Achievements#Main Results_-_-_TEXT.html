Main Results
Below a short point for point summary of the main results of our project is shown.
We have:
developed two Clickable Outer Membrane Proteins , COMPx and COMPy .
characterized the following properties of these proteins:
the SPAAC click reaction on the E. coli membranes.
the viability of E. coli cells expressing these proteins.
improved an existing BBa K811005, Improved Biobrick: COMPy - K1492001 .
delivered three new BioBricks  to the registry ( BBa K1492000 , BBa K1492001 and BBa K1492003 ).
tested two different molecular  coatings on our cells:
PEG 5kDa and 10kDa
DNA combined with Rolling  Circle Amplification
successfully designed and  developed microfluidic  devices:
which enable the production of  droplets in the desired size.
which allow fluorescent  beads to be encapsulated.
collaborated with the Rathenau  Institute in the Synenergene project.
written a children’s book used for educational purposes.
undertook several outreach  projects to spread knowledge on synthetic biology:
collaborated with the National Institute for  Public Health (RIVM).
held an informal information  evening for those interested.
actively reached out for press attention .
made all our lab protocols available for future teams
