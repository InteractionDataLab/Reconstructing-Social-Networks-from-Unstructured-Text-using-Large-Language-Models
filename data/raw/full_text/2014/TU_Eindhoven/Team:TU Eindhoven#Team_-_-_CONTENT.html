At the moment, I’m a second year student at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I’m enrolled in the bachelor Biomedical Engineering. I joined this year’s iGEM team because I like to challenge myself and I believed iGEM would be a really nice challenge since it combines the field of synthetic biology with model based engineering. I also liked the fact that you would be able to conduct your own research during a team project. Moreover, I’m curious whether full time lab work would suit me and iGEM seemed like the opportunity to get in touch with this kind of work. I hope that after bringing this iGEM project successfully to an end, I have acquired some nice skills that I’m able to apply often in my future activities. In the future, I hope I will be enjoying executing scientific research – although I do not yet know whether this will be in the field of synthetic biology.  </P><DIV class="read_more"><A class="btn" href="mailto:a.m.boschman@student.tue.nl">e-mail me</A></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="cont-grid_right"><DIV class="Jasper"><SPAN>Bas Bögels - PR</SPAN><P class="para">My name is Bas Bögels and I’m the team’s jack of all trades, doing lab work but also assisting the modelling team, and doing the external communications.
I’m currently in the second year of the bachelor Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team, because I wanted to work on a large project which wasn’t already done at our university (or elsewhere) and learn to do scientific research and plan your own project. Also I’m using iGEM to determine if the field of synthetic engineering is something I would like to specialize in. After iGEM I hope to have learned how to do my own research and hopefully decided if this field is something I would like to study further.

Currently I’m a third year student studying Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team to do research in the field of synthetic biology because this is one of my areas of interest. Also I think it is a good way to experience how to build a research from the ground up and to apply everything you learned during the courses to the real world.
After iGEM I will continue studying in the field of biomedical chemistry and biomaterials, focusing on designing new materials used for tissue engineering and pharmaceuticals.
