Techno-Moral Vignettes
For the Synenergene project we wrote three different techno-moral vignettes. The first vignette is about the Oil Munchers that help to remove crude oil after an oil spill. The second vignette is about synthetic islets of Langerhans that help reduce the stress on diabetic patients by producing insulin in the human body. The last scenario is about bacteria that help to clean the sewage water and by doing so also desalinating water in order to produce more clean drinking water.
