Cell Encapsulation Device
The cell encapsulation device ( Figure 3 and Figure 4 ) is based on the droplet device shown earlier. However, this time there are two continuous phases (co-flow) that come together at the first flow-focusing cross junction. One containing cells and the other containing a PEG solution. At this point the two continuous phases will create a laminar flow next to each other. At the second flow-focusing cross junction, encapsulation of cells will take place according to the same principle as in the droplet device. Once droplets are formed, they pass through a bumpy mixer [1]. This will ensure that the content is homogeneously distributed in the droplet.
Next the droplets will pass through a droplet chamber. This chamber is designed to hold up to a thousand droplets evenly distributed. The twelve pillars inside the chamber prevent the chamber from collapsing. After the flows are stabilized and droplets are formed, they can be trapped in the chamber. In the end the inlets and outlet can be cauterized to prevent the droplets from escaping. Now the droplets can simply be analyzed with a microscope.

Figure 4. The first flow-focusing cross junction is at the point where the orange channels and the yellow channel are coming together. The second flow-focusing cross junction is at the point where the orange and red channels are coming together.
