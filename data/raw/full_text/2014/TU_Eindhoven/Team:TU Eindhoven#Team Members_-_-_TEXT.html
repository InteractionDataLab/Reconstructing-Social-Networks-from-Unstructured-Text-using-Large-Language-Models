Anke Boschman - Organisation of Project
I have taken on the role of lab captain, meaning I am responsible for all the exciting experiments we perform in the wet lab. Together with Glenn, the modeling captain, I keep an overview of all the tasks and organize the team meetings. At the moment, I am a third year student at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I am enrolled in the bachelor Biomedical Engineering. I joined this year’s iGEM team because I like to challenge myself and I believed iGEM would be a really nice challenge since it combines the field of synthetic biology with model based engineering. Moreover, I hope that after I complete this iGEM project successfully I have acquired some nice skills that I am able to apply often in my future activities.

Bas Bögels - SPAAC Click Reaction Analysis, RCA
I am the team’s jack of all trades, doing lab work but also assisting the modeling team, and doing the external communications. I am currently in the third year of the bachelor Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team, because I wanted to work on a large project which was not already done at our university (or elsewhere) and learn to do scientific research and plan your own project. Also I am using iGEM to determine if the field of synthetic engineering is something I would like to specialize in. After iGEM I hope to have learned how to do my own research and hopefully decided if this field is something I would like to study further.

Boris Arts - Sponsoring, Microfluidics
Currently I am a fourth year student studying Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team to do research in the field of synthetic biology because this is one of my areas of interest. Also I think it is a good way to experience how to build a research from the ground up and to apply everything you learned during the courses to the real world. After iGEM I will continue studying in the field of biomedical chemistry and biomaterials, focusing on designing new materials used for tissue engineering and pharmaceuticals.

Bram Somers - Policy & Practices, BioBricking
I am helping with the sponsoring, the wiki page and the lab work. Like most of us, I study Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology and I am currently in my third year. My main reason for joining the team is because it seemed like a lot of fun. I wanted to gain more knowledge and skills on conducting research and iGEM could provide me with that. After iGEM I will most probably start working on my Bachelor End Project in the field of Protein Engineering. Furthermore, I will be giving the final presentations during the Giant Jamboree in Boston.

Glenn Cremers - Modeling, Construction Creation, BioBricking
I am the captain of the modeling team. I am responsible for all the modeling that needs to be done in the project. I am currently a third year student enrolled in the bachelor Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team, because I wanted to work on a challenging project which has not been done before allowing us to create our own project and the experiments we are going to do.  Also I am using iGEM to determine if the modeling part combined with the field of synthetic engineering is something I would like to specialize in. After iGEM I hope to have learned how to do my own research and experiments, and hopefully I will be able to decide if this field is something I would like to continue with.

Lenne Lemmens - Characterization of the System
My focus is on the lab work. I am currently in the second year of the master Biomedical Engineering in the field of chemical biology at the Eindhoven University of Technology. The iGEM team was an excellent opportunity for me to participate in a group project at an international level in the interesting field of synthetic biology. I recently started my graduation project in the exciting field of chemical biology.

Leroy Tan - Lab Safety, Microfluidics
I am the safety expert in the iGEM team: I am responsible for the safety in the laboratory. I am also part of the microfluidics team. Currently I am a third year bachelor student of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology.  I joined the iGEM team, because my interest goes to synthetic biology and I like to work in a team. The iGEM competition gives a great opportunity to combine this and it is instructive for both the theoretical part as the work in the lab. It will give me a lot of experience. After iGEM I want to receive my degree in Biomedical Engineering and I want to engineer innovative ideas.

Melissa van de Pasch - SPAAC Click Reaction Analysis, RCA
I have been working in the lab, furthermore I am responsible for the minutes of the meetings we have. I am now in my third year of the bachelor Biomedical Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team because I wanted to challenge myself more in my study. Also, I am very interested in synthetic biology and I want to find out if it is something I would like to specialize myself in. After iGEM I will hopefully have more experience in bigger projects and I hope to explore my interests.

Minke Nijenhuis - Public Relations, Children's Book, Policy & Practices
I am part of the Human Practices group and share responsibility in the aspect of Public Relations. Also I am helping with the lab work. I study Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the TU/e iGEM team because I wanted to take part in a project where we ourselves could choose the direction we want to take. iGEM offers a unique chance at teamwork, challenge and a lot of fun. A few years after iGEM I hope to get accepted into the post-master program for clinical chemistry and fulfill my dream of becoming a clinical chemist.

Nicolaas Ottenheym - Wiki Page
I am responsible for the content on our wiki page, also I am helping with the lab work. I study Medical Sciences and Technology at the Eindhoven University of Technology and I joined the TU/e iGEM team because I wanted to experience what it is like to work in a big team on a big project and this seemed to be a great chance to do so. After iGEM I hope to continue studying and working in the field of biochemistry.

Rafiq Lubken - Microfluidics, Wiki Page, ZAP
In this year’s iGEM team I am working in the lab as part of the microfluidics group, designing the TU Eindhoven iGEM Wiki Page and assisting others with their roles. Besides that, I am responsible for the ZAP, the zwitterionic approach. Currently, I am studying in the third year of the bachelor Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team this year since it would be a great opportunity to obtain certain skills for the rest of my bachelor, master and, most probable, also for my future activities in the Biomedical Engineering field. Furthermore, I really like working in groups on a project, particularly when we as group are able to form our own project. After the iGEM competition, I hope to have a good insight in doing research and hopefully I liked doing it.

Sanne Daniëls - Finances, Cell Viability
I am the treasurer of our team and I am also active in the lab. I study Medical Sciences and Technology at the Eindhoven University of Technology and I have joined this year’s team because it is a great opportunity to do a lot of lab work and learn about the field of synthetic biology. Also, working in an enthusiastic and fun team is a great experience. After iGEM I hope to get my bachelor and master degree. And that I will be working in a lab on protein engineering or tissue regeneration.

Tom Nijhof - Modeling, Policy & Practices, Game
My role this year is modeling and policy and practices. I study Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the team because for me iGEM was a great opportunity to bring my knowledge to the field.

Wiggert Altenburg - Characterization of the System, Construct Creation
I work mainly doing lab work and research. I study Medical Sciences and Technology at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team because it is a great opportunity and I think it is awesome to fully realize a whole research project while we are all still students. After iGEM I want to do a Master and PhD in the field of Chemical Biology.
