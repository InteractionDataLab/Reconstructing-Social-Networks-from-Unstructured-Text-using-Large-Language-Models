Some devices seemed to be too stiff  causing cracks in the PDMS which resulted in poor attachment of tubing
Bead encapsulation. Stiff devices  causing cracks resulting in loose tubing
Week 37: September  8 – September 14

Cut devices and ash. Three out of five  devices were usable due to bad oxygen ashing
Start small culture
Treat devices with aquapel. No dirt  seemed to be visible after drying with pressurized nitrogen
Start protein expression. First OD  measurement was 0.953. Continued inducing with IPTG
After protein expression OD was 0.343  which equals 2.74*108 cells/mL
Testing devices with fluorescent  bacteria.

Microfluidics lab
Cut and ash devices. Ashing protocol  adjusted to RF power: 30 W; vent time: 60 s; bleed time: 20 s.W at a pressure  of 0.9 mbar
Start small culture
Treated devices with aquapel. One  device appeared to show no binding with the glass. Start protein expression
OD after protein expression was 0.94.  This equals to 1.5*1010 cells/mL in the stock solution. Due to  maintenance of the microscope bacteria were stored till the next day
Droplet encapsulation was tested with  polyacrylamide devices. Droplets were formed successfully. A new oil phase was  made due to breaking of the droplets to ensure the quality of the oil phase.  After this the problem was solved.
Week 42: October  13 – October 19
Microfluidics lab
Start small culture.
Start protein expression.
Droplet encapsulation was tested with  polyacrylamide devices and fluorescent bacteria
