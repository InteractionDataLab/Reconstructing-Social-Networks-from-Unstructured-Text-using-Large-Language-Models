Project Description
Plasmid Design
Plasmid Design
The chosen vector for expression is pET29a. At both anchors at the N- and C-terminus the restriction sites for NdeI and SacI were introduced to clone the genes into a pET29a vector. The modified genes were first digested with the restriction enzymes and so was the pET29a vector. (Figure 1 and 2) After digestion the genes were ligated into the vector.
