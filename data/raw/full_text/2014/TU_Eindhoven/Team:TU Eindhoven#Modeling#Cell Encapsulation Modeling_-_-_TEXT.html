Cell Encapsulation Modeling
The modeling group focused on the microfluidics. With the use of microfluidics the cells are separated into single droplets. However, this process is not very accurate. Sometimes the droplets do not contain the desired number of cells. This inaccuracy can be modeled with the help of a Poisson distribution. In this model an average number of cells per droplet can be defined (lambda). Lambda can be varied in order to choose a suitable average number of cells per droplet for the cell encapsulation device [1].
Figure 1. Poisson distribution for multiple lambdas
The data from Figure 1 is used for the determination of the ratios between one cell:zero cells and one cell:two or more cells. Both of these have to be as high as possible for a specific lambda, shown in Figure 2 .
Figure 2. Ratio between one cell:zero cells or more cells
Based on the results extracted from Figure 2, a lambda of 0.3 was chosen for the cell encapsulation device. Lastly, the Poisson distribution for different number of cells is shown in Figure 3 .
Figure 3. Modeled Poisson distribution is shown together with the experimental Poisson distribution, both based on a specific lambda of 0.3
