Project Description
Protocols
Introduction
For this year's iGEM competition numerous protocols were devoloped to guide our experiments and keep our documentation neat and tidy. Because these protocols can also be useful to other projects, we decided to publish them on our wiki. You can find information and download links on this page down below.
genetic engineering protocols
The following protocols are used in the Biolab during the modification of bacteria.
Colony PCR Antibody Titration with FACS
FACS for sorting with DBCO-TAMRA
FACS for sorting with DBCO-PEG(10kDa)
Vector Ligation
Overhang PCR
PCR purification of DNA fragments
Plasmid Amplification
Plasmid Gene Digestion
Plasmid Purification
Preparative Steps
Protein Expression Curve
Protein Expression
Site Directed Mutagenesis
Vector Transformation
chemistry protocols
SPAAC reaction monitoring with UV-Visible Spectroscopy
microfluidics protocols
Here will follow all microfluidic engineering protocols
