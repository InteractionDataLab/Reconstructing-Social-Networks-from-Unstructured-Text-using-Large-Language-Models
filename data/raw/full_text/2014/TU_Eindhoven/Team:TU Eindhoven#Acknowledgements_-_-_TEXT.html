Acknowledgements
A list of all the persons and institutions that helped throughout the project. Without them it would have been impossible to achieve the results we have achieved now.
General Support
We would like to thank the Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS) for providing us with a room to work in on our project and the large amounts of hot chocolate in particular, and coffee.
Project support and advice
We would like to thank dr. Maarten Merkx, dr. ir. Tom de Greef and prof. dr. ir. Luc Brunsveld for their help during our brainstorm sessions and for their feedback on our experiments. Additionally, we would like to thank Ardjan van der Linden BSc for sharing his iGEM experience and other wisdoms.
Fundraising help and advice
We would like to thank Sagitta Peters MSc for her financial advice.
Lab support
We would like to thank ir. Stijn Aper for ordering lab materials and performing the final checks on our primers.
Difficult technique support
We would like to thank Martijn van Rosmalen MSc for his help with the FACS device.
Wiki support
We did not receive any external help. The wiki was fully created by our team members.
Presentation coaching
We are planning to present our project and its results on Friday the 24th of October to members of the Institute of Complex Molecular Systems. We hope to receive useful feedback on our project and presentation.
Policy & Practices support
We would like to thank the Synenergene project and the Rathenau institute for providing us with feedback on our application and techno-moral scenarios.
We would like to thank the RIVM for organizing the ‘Responsible approach to synthetic biology’ debate.
Thanks and acknowledgements to all other people involved in helping make a successful iGEM team
We would like to thank the ICMS animation studio for visualizing our Click Coli system. We would like to thank the Secretariat of ICMS for their help with organizational matters.
