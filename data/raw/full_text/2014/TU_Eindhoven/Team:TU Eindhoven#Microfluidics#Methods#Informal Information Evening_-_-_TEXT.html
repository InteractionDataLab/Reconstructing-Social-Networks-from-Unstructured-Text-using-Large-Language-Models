Informal Information Evening
On Friday the 26th of September we hosted an open evening for friends, family and other interested parties to inform them of the essence of synthetic biology, its opportunities and challenges and our iGEM project. During the evening we gave two presentations, one on synthetic biology in general and one on our project specifically . To see whether or not we helped our guests better understand synthetic biology we also took various tests, which were part of a social experiment .  Below some pictures are shown in order to give an impression of the evening.
Next, the lecture on synthetic biology in general was given by Glenn
Cremers and a quick test for the audience was led by Bram Somers
and Minke Nijenhuis.
The reception area, where guests could answer the questions of the first
test, while enjoying a a cup of coffee or tea.
Between the two lectures ,there was a break in which the public was asked to make another test.
The lecture on the iGEM competition, our project and the underlying
mechanisms was given by Anke Boschman. The microfluidics part was
covered by Leroy Tan and Bram Somers explained some application
scenarios of our Click Coli system.
We would like to thank the Institute for Complex Molecular Sciences
(ICMS) for providing us with a location for this great evening.
In our opinion the evening was quite successful and we are glad we could share our enthusiasm for synthetic biology with the community. We hope we have presented synthetic biology and our iGEM project in a way that was understandable to everyone present the evening of the 26th of September. If there are questions about the content of the lectures, please contact the presenters of the lectures.
