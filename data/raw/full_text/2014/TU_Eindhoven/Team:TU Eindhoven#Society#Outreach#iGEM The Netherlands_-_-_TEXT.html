iGEM The Netherlands
Team TU Eindhoven 2014 enjoyed participating in all the national meet ups organized in the Netherlands in 2014.
National iGEM meet up in Wageningen
The BananaGuard team from Wageningen organized a national iGEM conference on the 21st of June 2014 at which all participating iGEM teams in the Netherlands had the opportunity to meet each other, present their ideas and progress so far and receive constructive feedback on their project. Representatives of the Dutch Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM) were also present and showed interest in the area of synthetic biology, which led to further collaboration with RIVM (more info here ).
National iGEM meet up in Groningen
On the 13th of September 2014 team Groningen organized a second national meet up in Groningen. Again, all teams had the opportunity to present their project and there was plenty of room for discussion and questions with regard to each project. Afterwards the teams had a nice time dining out and exploring the city center of Groningen together.
