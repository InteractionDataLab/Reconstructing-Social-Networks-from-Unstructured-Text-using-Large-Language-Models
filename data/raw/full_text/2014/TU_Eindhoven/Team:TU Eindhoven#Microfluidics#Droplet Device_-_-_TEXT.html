Droplet Device
To answer the questions mentioned at the introduction, a droplet device with a single oil inlet and a single water inlet is used (
Figure 3
). Both channels will end in a so called flow-focusing cross junction, where the droplets will be formed. The fluids will first pass a filter to minimize blockage at the cross junction nozzle. The curved channels just before the cross junction are fluid resistors and will create a laminar flow [1]. It is possible to control the droplet size and droplet formation frequency, by alternating the rates of the oil phase and the water phase.
