Sponsors
On behalf of the iGEM team we would like to thank everyone for their contribution during the iGEM 2014 competition to bring our project to a success. Every little bit of help was welcome and was spent well. We had a lot of fun during the competition and also acquired some good results. We would like to thank each sponsor personally for their contribution. Below, you can find the company logos of every company that contributed to the project whether it was with materials or with a donation. Especially, we would like to thank the Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS) for being our main sponsor. The ICMS provided us with an office in their building, made their lab available and provided us with food and drinks. Without them none of this would have been possible.
The Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS) provided us with funding. The ICMS combines mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry and engineering to stimulate education and research of complex molecular systems. Their mission is to become the leading international multidisciplinary institute for research and education in this field of research. To achieve this they perform top research in complex molecular systems, train talented young scientists, organize interdisciplinary science activities and provide an advanced study center. For more information visit the ICMS Website .
GenScript provided us with a coupon for synthesizing our designed plasmid with their service. GenScript is the leading gene, peptide, protein and antibody research partner for fundamental life science research, translational biomedical research, and early stage pharmaceutical development. Since its establishment in 2002, GenScript has exponentially grown to become a global leading Contract Research Organization that provides services and products to scientists in 86 countries worldwide. Learn more at the GenScript Website .
Jena-Bioscience provided us with DBCO-PEG 10kDa for our experiments. The company focuses on development of innovative reagents and technologies for the life science market. For more information please visit the Jena-Bioscience Website .
Merial supported our project financially. Merial is a company that focuses on animal health. Their goal is to enhance the health, well-being and productivity of many animal species. For more information please visit the Merial Website .
SnapGene provided us with free licenses of their software to design our plasmids. SnapGene created software for researchers to make cloning procedures easier, enabling researchers to better plan their cloning procedures. For more information please visit the SnapGene Website .
The Universiteitsfonds supported us financially. The Universiteitsfonds supports the University in education, research and culture by helping fund activities which otherwise would not be possible to realize. For more information please visit the Universiteitsfonds Website .
Dopharma contributed financially to support our project. Dopharma is a veterinary pharmaceutical company which also focuses, next to the production of veterinary medicinal products, on research, registration, distribution and marketing of their products.
