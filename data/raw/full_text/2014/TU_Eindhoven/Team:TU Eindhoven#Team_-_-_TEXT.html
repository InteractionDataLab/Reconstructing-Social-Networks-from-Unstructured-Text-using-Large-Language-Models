TU Eindhoven iGEM Team
TU Eindhoven iGEM Team 2014
Anke Boschman - Lab Captain
My name is Anke Boschman and I will take on the role of lab captain, meaning I will be responsible for all the exciting experiments we will perform in the wet lab.  Together with Glenn, the modelling captain, I will keep an overview of all the tasks and information and we will schedule and organize the team meetings.  At the moment, I’m a second year student at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I’m enrolled in the bachelor Biomedical Engineering. I joined this year’s iGEM team because I like to challenge myself and I believed iGEM would be a really nice challenge since it combines the field of synthetic biology with model based engineering. I also liked the fact that you would be able to conduct your own research during a team project. Moreover, I’m curious whether full time lab work would suit me and iGEM seemed like the opportunity to get in touch with this kind of work. I hope that after bringing this iGEM project successfully to an end, I have acquired some nice skills that I’m able to apply often in my future activities. In the future, I hope I will be enjoying executing scientific research – although I do not yet know whether this will be in the field of synthetic biology.

Bas Bögels - PR
My name is Bas Bögels and I’m the team’s jack of all trades, doing lab work but also assisting the modelling team, and doing the external communications. I’m currently in the second year of the bachelor Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team, because I wanted to work on a large project which wasn’t already done at our university (or elsewhere) and learn to do scientific research and plan your own project. Also I’m using iGEM to determine if the field of synthetic engineering is something I would like to specialize in. After iGEM I hope to have learned how to do my own research and hopefully decided if this field is something I would like to study further.

Boris Arts - Sponsoring
My name is Boris Arts and I’m part of the modelling team. Next to my main role, I make sure all expenses will be covered by enlisting sponsors. Currently I’m a third year student studying Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team to do research in the field of synthetic biology because this is one of my areas of interest. Also I think it is a good way to experience how to build a research from the ground up and to apply everything you learned during the courses to the real world. After iGEM I will continue studying in the field of biomedical chemistry and biomaterials, focusing on designing new materials used for tissue engineering and pharmaceuticals.

Bram Somers -  Wiki
My name is Bram Somers and I’m helping with the sponsoring, the wiki page and the lab work. Like most of us, I study Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology and I’m currently finishing my second year. My main reason for joining the team is because it seemed like a lot of fun. I wanted to gain more knowledge and skills on conducting research and iGEM could provide me with that. After iGEM I will most probably start working on my Bachelor End Project in the field of Protein Engineering.

Glenn Cremers - Modelling Captain
My name is Glenn Cremers and I’m the captain of the modelling team. I’m responsible for all the modelling that needs to be done in the project. I’m currently studying in the second year of the bachelor Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the iGEM team, because I wanted to work on a challenging project which hasn’t been done before allowing us to create our own project and the experiments we are going to do.  Also I’m using iGEM to determine if the modelling part combined with the field of synthetic engineering is something I would like to specialize in. After iGEM I hope to have learned how to do my own research and experiments, and hopefully I’ll be able to decide if this field is something I would like to continue with.

Jasper Nooten - Wiki Maestro
My name is Jasper Nooten my role in the team consists of lab work, because I want to gain more experience in the practical side. I also hope to do a bit of modeling.I study biomedical engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I joined the team because I wanted to do a project in which I am able to do novel research, and to be able to influence the outcome of the project to a bigger extend than the projects in the regular education program. It also seemed fun to me to do a project in which I can apply chemistry in the lab. After the iGEM has finished I want to start a Masters program oriented towards biochemistry, and look into a job related to pharmaceutics.

Leroy Tan -  Safety Expert
My name is Leroy Tan and I’m the safety expert in the iGEM team: I’m responsible for the safety in the laboratory. Currently I’m a second year bachelor student of Biomedical Engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology.  I joined the iGEM team, because my interest goes to synthetic biology and I like to work in a team. The iGEM competition gives a great opportunity to combine this and it’s instructive for both the theoretical part as the work in the lab. It will give me a lot of experience. After iGEM I want to receive my degree in Biomedical Engineering and I want to engineer innovative ideas.
