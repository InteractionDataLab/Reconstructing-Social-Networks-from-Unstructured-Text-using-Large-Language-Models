Design
To test the concept of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated phage therapy, a three step experiment was needed.
CRISPR-Cas Vector Synthesis
The first step was to design a spacer RNA sequence to specifically bind within a target gene but no where else in the E. coli genome.  An RNA sequence was designed to be complementary to a unique sequence found within the neomycin phosphotransferase gene.  Using restriction digestion and ligation the spacer sequence in BBa_K1218011(CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid) was replaced with the new targeting spacer sequence.
Verification of CRISPR specificity
The second phase of the project was to transform the targeting CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid into BW23115(::kan) E. coli to verify that Cas9 can be directed to a specific sequence determined by the spacer and that double stranded breaks in the genome are sufficient to kill a bacterium. The CRISPR-Cas plasmid has been shown to effectively kill bacterial strains when expressed within targeted bacterial cells if the spacer is complementary to the target cell’s genome¹ ² ³.   The specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 killing has been demonstrated to be specifically cytotoxic to a single nucleotide mutation, meaning strains of bacteria differing in a single SNP can be differentiated by the CRISPR guide RNA².  However, creating an effective delivery mechanism for the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid remains a large obstacle.
Phage delivery of CRISPR-Cas9
The third part of the project attempts to solve the delivery mechanism problem by using non-replicating recombinant bacteriophage.  The non-replicating phage are created by infecting cells containing helper phagemids (plasmids coding for phage structural proteins), M13K07, with the CRISPR-Cas9 phagemid (a plasmid containing a phage packaging signal), BBa_K1445001.  Similar projects have been published in Nature Biotechnology this year by Professor Marrafini of the Laboratory of Bacteriology at the Rockefeller University in New York¹ and Professor Timothy Lu of the MIT Microbiology Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology².  The results of these studies are promising; however, further refinement of the phage delivery is required to increase virulency rates².
