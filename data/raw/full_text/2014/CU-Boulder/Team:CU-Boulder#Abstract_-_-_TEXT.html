The transformations with DNA from the well (B2 and P2) had lower efficiencies than those with DNA from a mini-prep. Most likely this is due to drastic differences in DNA concentration (p110+RBS (2) 4/23 was at 254.4ng/ul)
Conclusions
None of the competent cells were contaminated
All of the competent cells are in fact, competent
Set up O/N of DH5-alpha cells to make competent tomorrow
Planning ahead
Wednesday
Make chemically competent DH5alpha cells
Test chemically competent cells
Start phage DNA isolation protocol
Thursday
If transformation worked, transform cas9 into cells
Finish phage DNA isolation protocol
If primers come in, PCR on phage DNA (digestion method)
Gibson?
Friday
Digest PCR
Also pSB1C3 backbone
Gel extraction
Ligation
Saturday
Transformation
6/4
Received cas9 from distribution kit (from GOLD): 4M
Make chemically competent DH5alpha cells
Labeled: 5a (that’s an alpha sign) 6/4 80 or 120ul
Made chemically competent BW23115 with F-episome
labeled: BWF+ 6/4
80ul per tube
Transformation into new competent 5a (6/4)

2B                                2ul
2P                                2ul
2P                                3ul
No DNA
Plated onto Chlor
Also, thawed 5a cells for 45 minutes then returned to freezer
Tomorrow, we will transform and test competency
Also include non-competent control
Isolation of single-stranded phagemid DNA using M13K07
Added ER2738 colony to 50mL LB
Plate was cold. Next time warm plate before pricking
After 4 hours, OD was at 0.02. Waited 45 minutes and OD was at 0.08 (somehow). Therefore, we infected at OD 0.08
Had started another culture when we did not think the first was growing. In incubator for about 1 hour. OD was 0.00. We infected anyway because last time it worked.
Let infection proceed for 60 minutes then added 70ul of Kanamycin
Primers came in!
Gem001 F & R, Gem002 F & R, Gem003 F & R
Resuspended DNA and diluted 1:10
Other primers were ordered today
Made assembly of plates with various antibiotic combinations
6/5
Transformation results from 6/4
No growth on negative (no DNA) control: no contamination
> 400 colonies for positive (p11+RBS (2), diluted 1:10) control. Lawn when not diluted
~100 colonies for 2B (2ul) not diluted, 18 colonies on 1:10 dilution
3 colonies for 2P (2ul) not diluted, 0 on 1:10 dilution
20 colonies for 2P (3ul) not diluted, 1 on 1:10 dilution
Made overnights of 2B and 2P to make freeze downs tomorrow
Isolated single-stranded M13K07 DNA
Final concentration = 5724 ng/ul
Calculated from 1:10 dilution which had concentration of 572.4ng/ul
For second sample in pair, we resuspended it in TE but did not proceed to DNA extraction steps
For the second culture we started 6/4, we resuspended pellet in TBS and glycerol to preserve the M13 phage. Measured absorbances (before glycerol was added)
#1
269 => 1.690A
320 => 0.103A
#2
269 => 1.453
320 => 0.059
To biobrick M13ori through biobrick assembly (the old-school way)
PCR on Litmus 28i to amplify/biobrick M13ori
Used primers Gem003 F & R
Diluted Litmus 28i DNA 1:10
Digestion of p11+RBS (1) to digest pSB1C3 bb with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF
Ran samples on gel and gel extracted pieces. We recieved very low yields (out of range for nano drop)
M13 ori: 4.0 ng/ul
pSB1C3: 1.8 ng/ul
Digested M13 ori fragment despite poor extraction yield with EcoRI-HF and PstI-HF
Used 1.5x as much DNA as instructed based on inaccurate concentration
Ligation
10hr @ 16C, 10min @ 65C, 4ever @ 4C
To biobrick M13 ori through Gibson Assembly (the cool-kids way)
PCR on Litmus 28i
Used primers Gem002 F & R
Diluted Litmus 28i DNA 1:10
PCR on pSB1C3 (p11+RBS (1))
Used primers Gem001 F & R
Diluted pSB1C3 DNA 1:3
6/6
Ran gel of PCR products from (6/5)
Recieved bands for pSB1C3 around 2000bp and M13ori around 500bp
No contamination in pSB1C3 PCR negative control
Band in M13ori negative control that is the same size as sample. Contaminated by sample?
Gibson Assembly
Diluted pSB1C3 and M13ori PCR products 1:10
Incubated 60min @ 50C
Also used provided pUC16 as positive control
Transformation
1. p110+RBS                        Positive control
2. No DNA                        Negative control
3. Cas9 from distribution kit        so we can have more
4. Thaw and refreeze cells        Test competency of comp cells after thawed
5. Not chem comp cells        Negative control for the above
6. Ligation Product
7. Gibson product
7.2. Gibson product diluted 1:4
8. Gibson positive control
7.2. Gibson positive control diluted 1:4
For the Gibson product and the positive control, we transformed 2ul of product and 2ul of 1:4 diluted product. NEB recomends the first if using their competent cells and the second if using cells from other companies. Our cells are from NEB but we made them competent ourselves so we tried both ways
Plated on Chlor at concentrations of 170, 85, and 33 ug/mL
Primers came in
Resuspended and made 1:10 dilutions
6/7
Results from 6/6 transformation
1. Positive control
Lots of growth, ~300-400 on 1:10 dilution
2. No DNA negative control
No growth
3. Cas9 from distribution kit
7 potential colonies (some are close to edges through) on non-diluted
4. Thawed then refroze cells
Looks like (1)
5. Not chemically competent cells
No growth
6. Ligation product
13 potential colonies (some are close to edge)
7. Gibson Assembly Product
170 -> No colonies
85 -> No colonies
33 -> 3 specks
7.2. Gibson Assembly product diluted 1:10
170 -> 1 speck
85 -> 3 colonies
33 -> 13 colonies
8. Gibson positive control
No colonies
8.2. Gibson positive control diluted 1:4
No colonies
Made 6mL O/N cultures
4 from (3) cas9 plate
7 from (6) Ligation product
5 from (7.2 [85]) Diluted Gibson product on 85 ug/mL Chlor
8 from (7.2 [33]) Diluted Gibson product on 33 ug/mL Chlor
