Conjugation of XL-10 (with sSP011)
1)   From O/N cultures Dilute strains 1/100 in LB
2)   Wait for OD to reach O,2
3)   Prepare  tube (in BD tubes) :
-       Tube = 0,5mL LB with Strain (sSP011) + 0,5mL LB with Strain (XL-10 Kan)
4)   Incubate 2 hours at 37°C (actually not in the shaker, but we accidently kept them in the shaker...)
5)   Plate 20ul  for mixed tube on LB antiobiotics (Tet, Kan)
6)   Incubate overnight at 37°C
