Obtained BW23115 KanR cells- BW23115 cells that had their native CRISPR-Cas system knocked out by the insertion of a Kanamycin resistance gene
-Will also be called BW23115 or BW
-Conjugated BW23115 KanR cells with contain F’ notation (ex. BWF’)
Obtained ER2738 cells that contain the F’ episome (no changes from NEB sample)
-Will also be called ER. Assume that all ER samples contain the F’ episome
-Streaked sample onto LB+Tet (20ug/mL) to select for colonies containing F’ episome
5/10
Did receive colonies from 5/9 selection
Week 2
5/12
Need to conjugate BW23115 KanR cells with the F’ episome
-Set up overnight cultures of ER2738 and BW23115 KanR
-When mixed, ER2738 will donate it’s F’ episome and BW23115 KanR will receive the F’ episome. F’ episome confers Tetracycline resistance
5/13
Started M13 Amplification: Amplify M13 phage using the M13K07 Helper Phage
-Let precipitated in NaCl/PEG solution overnight
-Possible sources of error
Did not sterilize 2.5M NaCl/20% PEG-8000 solution
Added 4-fold PEG solution
Compensated by adding more LB
During precipitation, put sample in -20C for 30 minutes before realizing mistake and moving to it to 4C. Sample partially froze
Conjugated BW23115 with F’ episome
-Added 1mL BW23115 to 1mL ER2738 overnight culture
-Incubated at 37C for 30 minutes, shaking
-Plated on LB+Kan(50ug/mL)+Tet(20ug/mL)
To select for BW cells that took the F’ episome (containing Tet resistance)
5/14
Finished the M13 Amplification
-Visualized product on UV-vis. There was a tall spike at 269nm indicating that DNA was present. Did not test at 320nm.
Results of BW23115 Conjugation
-Many colonies indicating successful conjugation of F’ episome into BW23115
-Set up overnight to make freeze down tomorrow
Set up overnight of ER2738 to make chemically competent tomorrow
5/15
Made freeze down of BW23115 KanR F’
-BW23115 E. coli strain with Kanamycin resistance gene inserted into genome and with F’ episome
Made chemically competent ER2738 cells
Transformation of Litmus28i (from NEB) into chemically competent ER2738 cells
-Added 1ul Litmus28i plasmid to 40ul competent cells
-Plated on LB + Amp(100ug/mL)
-Purpose: To make M13 phage that package Litmus28i DNA. Need phagemid (Litmus28i) DNA in infectable cells (cells containing F’ episome) to introduce M13K07 Helper Phage and make phage.
5/16
Results of 5/15 transformation
-No growth for No DNA control
-Many colonies for sample
Week 3
5/19
M13 Amplification to isolate M13-Litmus28i phage
-Cells: ER2738 cells containing Litmus28i phagemid
-Helper Phage: M13K07
-Not much phage was precipitated
Set up overnight culture of ER2738 to infect tomorrow
5/20
Infected ER2738 cells with M13-Litmus28i phage
-Plated only on Ampicillin(100ug/mL)  (should have also plated on kanamycin)
-Infected for 4-5 hours-> should have only infected for 30 minutes maximum. This extra time gives the cells that were infected with M13-M13K07 the time to produced M13-M13K07 phage and reinfect
5/21
Results from M13-Litmus28i infection of ER2738
-Solid lawn of growth for diluted and non-diluted
-Also sickly looking growth
Set up overnights
-ER2738 cells containing Litmus28i for freeze down
-BW23115 with F’ episome to make chemically competent cells
-ER2738 to redo infection
5/22
Tested absorbance of phage produced through M13 amplification on 5/19
-Low absorbance of 0.018 at 269nm but no detection at wavelength 320nm
-Decided to redo M13 amplification
Made chemically competent BW23115 with f-episome
Made freeze down of ER2738 containing Litmus28i
Set up overnight of ER2738 containing Litmus28i to redo M13 amplification tomorrow
5/23
Protocol switch to make phage using phagemid
-“M13 Amplification” protocol should only be used to make more M13-M13K07, not to make M13 phage containing a different phagemid
-Switched to new protocol (“Use of M13K07 Helper Phage for isolation of single stranded phagemid DNA” by NEB. Made modifications (see our protocols) to isolate phage rather than single-stranded DNA)
-Making phage….

-Based on calculations from 5/24, we needed to add 0.011 ul phage per 1 mL of cells at 1 OD. This equates to 0.055 ul of phage into 5 mL cells; therefore we made a 1:10 dilution so we could add 0.5ul. Unfortunately, the pipet would not take up 0.5ul so we added 0.8ul of M13-Litmus28i phage
-Grew the cells for 20 minutes at 37C
-Plated 300ul onto Kanamycin (50ug/mL) and 300ul onto Ampicillin (100ug/mL) for each sample
Incubated overnight at 37C
Note: During the production of phage, the phagemid SHOULD be packaged preferentially over the Helper Phagemid but some Helper Phagemid will still be packaged. We plated on Amp to select for cells that were infected with phage containing Phagemid. We plated on Kan to select for cells that were infected with phage containing Helper Phagemid. This allows us to compare the packaging efficiency of Helper Phagemid: Phagemid.
5/26
Results from 5/25 infection with M13-Litmus28i
Sample
Result
Significance
ER2738 on Amp
Lawn
Litmus28i phagemid was successfully packaged into the M13 phage and is infectable
ER2738 on Kan
100-200 colonies
Some M13 helper phage is packaged into the M13 phage but at a much lower rate than Litmus28i
BW23115 on Amp
Lawn
BW23115 is ‘equally’ infectable by M13 as ER2738
BW23115 on Kan
Lawn
BW23115 contains Kan resistance in its genome so this tells us nothing
Conclusions:
-Cells grew on Ampicillin; therefore, Litmus28i phagemid was successfully packaged into M13 phage.
-For ER2738 samples, there was significant growth on Ampicillin compared to Kanamycin; therefore, Litmus28i phagemid is packaged preferentially over M13K07 Helper Phagemid
-M13-Litmus28i retains its infectivity of cells containing the F’ episome
Because we received lawns, we have to redo the infection and plate less cells so we can calculate the uptake ratio between the phagemid and helper phage based on the number of colonies
Started 50 mL overnight of K12 ER2738 and BW23115
5/27
Redo the infection done on 5/25
-Infectable cells: ER2738 and BW23115
Plated non-infected samples of each (non-diluted) to check for contaminants
-Diluted M13-Litmus28i (1) phage by a factor of 10. Added 5.5ul to each sample
-Grew samples for 20 minutes at 37C, 250rpm
-Plated 100ul of onto an Ampicillin (100ug/mL) plate and onto a Kanamycin (50ug/mL) plate. Incubated overnight at 37C.
Dilutions = 1:10; 1:100; and 1:1000
5/28
Results from 5/27
-Controls were as expected
No growth for ER2738 non-infected grown on Amp, ER2738 non-infected grown on Kan, or BW23115 non-infected grown on Amp
Growth for BW23115 non-infected grown on Kan (BW23115 has Kan R in genome)
-Many colonies were received for all dilutions (1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000) of the following
ER2738 infected and plated on Amp
BW23115 infected and plated on Amp
BW23115 infected and plated on Kan
-Many (100s to 1000?) colonies grew on 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions of ER2738. 50-100 colonies grew on the 1:1000 dilution of ER2738
Compare this to the 100-200 colonies that grew from 2/25 infection (which was 300ul non-diluted, infected cells)
Reasons for increased yield
Added too much phage?
volume changed between experiment (5mL to 50mL)
Overnight culture may not have been saturated. If still in log phase, the cells would continue to grow
Made 50mL O/N cultures of ER2738 and BW23115 so we can repeat the infection tomorrow and plate further dilutions starting at 1:1000
-Carry out infection in 5mL and 50mL to test volume effect?

Experiment 1: Infect cells using same method as 5/25 (in a 5mL culture)
-Started with 1OD cells in 5mL
-Added about 0.7ul (inaccuracies in pipet) of 1:10 diluted M13-Litmus28i phage
-Incubated (rotating) for 20 minutes
-Made 1:1,000 and 1:10,000 dilutions
-Plated 100ul on Ampicillin (100ug/mL) plates and on Kanamycin (50ugmL) plates
Included non-infected samples diluted by 1:1000
This negative control can be used for Experiment 2 since the non-infected parent solution is the same
-Incubate overnight at 37C
Experiment 2: Infect cells using protocol from “Eliminating helper phage from phage display”
-Diluted O/Ns to OD of 0.1 in 50 mL culture
-Grew samples until of OD of ER2728 = 0.59 and the OD of BW23115 = 0.60
Missed OD of 0.5 mark, but the two samples are close to each other
-Chilled samples on ice for 30 minutes
-Warmed in incubator for 35 minutes (should have been 30)
-Amount of phage. Rather than use 1:1 as mentioned in protocol, we used multiplicity of 1:10 (phage:cell)
Added 3.3ul of 1:10 diluted M13-Litmus28i (1) phage
(On 5/27 we added 5.5ul of diluted phage to 50mL of cells at OD of 1. Our cells were at OD of .6; therefore, 5.5*.6 = 3.3ul)
-Incubated for 30 minutes at 37C, not shaking
We later change this to shaking
-Dilutions
1:1,000; 1:5,000; 1:10,000; 1:50,000; 1:100,000; 1:1,000,000
Plated ER2738 and BW23115 on Ampicillin (100ug/mL)
Plated ER2738 on Kanamycin (50ug/mL)
Experiment 3: Growth Test (for growth curve)
-We were concerned by the low OD of the Overnights from the last few days. Wanted to be sure that 2.0-3.0 was not still in log phase. Cultures looked saturated but the OD seemed low.

Other
-Made Amp and Kan plates (1 sleeve of each)
-Made 50mL O/N of ER2738 and BW23115F’ in case we need further dilutions
-Made 5mL O/N of ER2738, BW23115F’, and BW23115 (without F’ episome) to make chemically competent tomorrow
Did not have plate of BW23115 (without F’ episome) so used freeze down. Hoping to get O/N of a picked colony from CRISPR Team tomorrow morning
5/30
Made chemically competent cells of…
-ER2738
-BW23115F’ (conjugated with F’ episome)
-BW23115 (not conjugated- without F’ episome)
Culture started from plate
-BW23115* not conjugated (without F’ episome)
Culture started from freeze down
Results from infections
-Negative Controls (cells were not infected; cells were diluted 1:1000)
-Results from Experiment 1 (5/29)
-Results from Experiment 2 (5/29)
Math
-If there are 5.00E+8 cells in 1mL of culture at OD of 1, then in 1mL of culture at OD of 0.59, there are 2.95E+8 cells. In a 50mL culture at OD of 0.59, there are 1.48E+10 cells.
-We added 3.3ul (0.0033mL) phage at concentration 4.62E+11 phage/mL which amounts to 1.52E+9 total phage
-Assuming that 1 phage infects 1 bacterium, we can assume that 1.52E+9 bacterial have the potential to be infected in the 50mL culture
-We plated 100ul of culture at various dilutions. If not diluted, the number of cells that can be potentially infected in 0.1mL equals 1.52E+9/500, or 3.05E+06 cells. We then accounted for the dilutions (for 1:1000 dilution, we divided 3.05E+06 by 1000 to receive 3.05E+03)
-The following table contains the number of cells with the potential to be infected assuming a 100% infectivity rate by M13 phage and that 1 cell is infected only once.

Conclusions from infections
-Results between and within the three trials are inconsistent. For example, the number of colonies received in experiments 1 and 2 from 5/29 differ greatly. Due to the differences in protocol, variation was expected but not to this extent.
-Our dilutions did not yield the expected 10 fold (or 5 fold) decrease in growth that was expected.
-Plates from 5/29 could be plated better to reduce dense areas of growth and growth around the rim.
-Though the experiment contained many errors we can say that the phagemid (Litmus 28i) is preferentially packaged compared to the helper phage (M13K07) but not to the degree we expected.
-Could receive increased occurrences of cells containing M13k07 due to infection, phage production, further infection

The transformations with DNA from the well (B2 and P2) had lower efficiencies than those with DNA from a mini-prep. Most likely this is due to the differences in DNA concentration (p110+RBS (2) 4/23 was at 254.4ng/ul)
Conclusions
-None of the competent cells were contaminated
-All of the competent cells are in fact, competent
Set up O/N of DH5-alpha cells to make competent tomorrow
6/4
Isolation of single-stranded phagemid DNA using M13K07
-Added ER2738 colony to 50mL LB
Plate was cold. Next time warm plate before pricking
Best to use freshly grown plate
-After 4 hours, OD was at 0.02. Waited 45 minutes and OD was at 0.08. Therefore, we infected at OD 0.08
-Had started another culture when we did not think the first was growing. In incubator for about 1 hour. OD was 0.00. We infected anyway because last time it worked.
-Let infection proceed for 60 minutes then added 70ul of Kanamycin to be a final concentration of 70ug/mL
Primers came in to biobrick M13ori (packaging signal on Litmus28i)
-Resuspended primers and diluted 1:10
6/5
Isolated single-stranded M13K07 DNA
-Final concentration = 5724 ng/ul (calculated from a 1:10 dilution)
-For second sample in pair, we resuspended it in TE but did not proceed to DNA extraction teps
-For the second culture we started 6/4, we resuspended pellet in TBS and glycerol to preserve the M13 phage. Measured absorbances (before glycerol was added)

For our first biobrick, we wanted to isolate the M13 origin, a segment ~500bp that allows for packaging into the M13 phage. We tried to achieve this by biobrick assembly and by Gibson Assembly.

Week 6
6/8
Check colonies for correct constructs.
-Mini-prepped all 24 O/Ns
Yielded low concentrations for samples 12, 15, 19, and 22
-Digested all with EcoRI and PstI (10ul reactions)
-Ran results on gel
All 4 cas9 samples had the expected bands of 2000 and 5000bp
All 7 ligation products have expected bands of 2000 and ~570bp
3 of 5 Gibson assemblies from 85ug/mL Chlor plate had expected bands of 2000 and ~500bp
3 of 8 Gibson assemblies from 33ug/mL Chlor plate had expected bands of 2000 and ~500bp
1-4: Cas9 from Stanford-Brown team
5-11: pSB1C3-M13ori cloned through ligation
12-24: pSB1C3-M13ori cloned through Gibson Assembly
12-16: Grown with 85 ug/mL Chlor
17-24: Grown with 33 ug/mL Chlor
Conclusions from gel
-We have cas9 safely in cells
-Our ligation reactions successfully yielded M13ori on pSB1C3
-Combined, we had a 46% success rate for the Gibson Assembly in yielding M13ori on pSB1C3
The 4 samples that had the lowest concentration after being mini-prepped (12,15, 19, and 22) correlate with samples that had the correct band pattern
We selected 4 samples from each (4 total between the two Gibson reactions) type
-For non-Gibson Assembled samples

Transformation
1. Positive control (p110+RBS diluted 1:10)
2. Non-diluted Gibson product
3. Gibson product diluted 1:4
4. Gibson product diluted 1:10
-Transformed each sample using our usual method and using the protocol given by Gibson
-Due to not have plates ready before transformation, in step 4, the samples sat for about 50 minutes. Then in step 8, they both recovered for about 150 minutes. Though not specified in our protocol, we did warm the plates to 37C. In step 10 for our protocol, since we only added 200ul SOC and wanted to plate on 3 selection plates (see below), we only plated 50ul (except for the positive control).
-Plated on three concentrations of Chloramphenicol (33 ug/mL, 85 ug/mL, and 170 ug/mL) to determine the differences in yield due to differences in concentration.Obvious hypothesis: more colonies will grow on plates that have a lower concentration of chlor.

Because ‘No DNA control 6/10’ yielded colonies, we researched Zeocin plates
-According to Life Technologies (Invitrogen), Zeocin requires low salt medium and a pH of 7.5
-Low Salt LB Medium (1L)
Ingredients
10g    Tryptone
5g    NaCl
5g    Yeast Extract
-Mix ingredients
-Adjust pH to 7.5 using NaOH (If go over, use HCl)
-Add agar for plates at 15g/L. Autoclave
-Thaw Zeocin on ice. Vortex
-Add Zeocin to final concentration of 25ug/mL
Transformation #2
-Repeat of transformation on 6/11 but this time we will plate on the correct plates
-Also remade Zeocin plates

Transformation Results for 6/11
-Several hundred colonies on Positive Control (p110+RBS)    on Chlor
-No colonies for GA positive control                    on Amp
-No colonies for M13ori + ZeoR mistakenly plated             on Amp
-No colonies for No DNA control                    on Amp
-100-ish colonies for No DNA control                    on Zeo
-100-ish colonies for cas9+AmpR+gRNA mistakenly plated    on Zeo
-These last 3 points suggest/confirm that Zeo plates are no good
Transformation Results from 6/12 control test
-Colonies grew is about equal amounts on all plates, including No DNA control
Either plates don’t contain Chlor or competent cells are contaminated
-Streaked competent cells onto new and old Chlor plates
Infection test of ER2738: Is Litmus preferentially packaged over M13K07 Helper phage? Is pSB1C3-M13ori preferentially packaged?
-Infect ER2738 with phage produced 6/12
Phage should have packaged Litmus 28i phagemid or pSB1C3-M13ori
Cells infected with phage packaging Litmus 28i will grow on Amp
Cells infected with phage packaging pSB1C3-M13ori will grow on Chlor
Cells infected with phage packaging M13K07 will grow on Kan
-After we plate, we can count the colonies and calculate a ratio of Litmus28i: M13K07 or pSB1C3-M13ori:M13K07 packaging
6/14
Results of contamination test (streaked competent cells onto new and old Chlor plates)
-Colonies grew in low amounts on both plates. most likely the cells are contaminated
Transformation results for 6/12
-Many colonies for No DNA control                    on Zeo
-Some colonies are turning pinkish-red
-Many colonies for diluted and non-diluted M13 genes+ZeoR    on Zeo
-Some colonies are turning pinkish-red
Could the white colonies be the designed colonies and can we kill the red colonies with Zeocin before killing the white colonies (aka. Use high Zeocin concentrations to select for the correct construct)
-Selected 1 red colony from No DNA Zeo control plate and 1 white colony from M13genes+ZeoR sample plate
-Added 100ul H2O then divided amongst 5 culture tubes each (with 5mL of low-salt LB, pH 7.5)
-Then added Zeocin to a final concentration of: 0, 25, 50, 75, 100ug/mL.
Results of 6/13 infection
-Litmus 28i infected cells
on Kan: Individual colonies for 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000. No colonies on 1:5000
on Amp: lawn for 1:10, 1:100, and near lawn for 1:1000. Single colonies for 1:5000
-pSB1C3-M13ori infected cells
on Kan: Same as Litmus 28i samples on Kan
on Chlor: Lawn for all dilutions. Must discredit due to recent Chlor contamination
Week 7
6/15
Results of Zeocin experiment on 6/14
-Healthy growth for both at 0ug/mL Zeo
-No growth for white colony with any Zeo
-Good growth for red colony even at 100ug/mL Zeo
-This suggests that the red colonies are naturally resistant to Zeocin. Also, our plates must not contain active Neocin. We are sure that we are adding enough. Possibly, we add it while the media is too hot or leave the plates at room temperature (decondensing) for too long and this deactivates the antibiotic? Perhaps we are not attaining the correct pH
In light of recent contamination problems on both Chlor and Zeo, we made new competent cells
-5alpha
-BW23115
-BW23115 conjugated (contains f-episome)
6/16
Made new Chlor antibiotic. Made to Chlor plates
Contamination Test: Streaked Zeo and new Chlor plates each with
-Colony from Zeo contaminated plate
-Colony from Chlor contaminated plate
-Non-transformed OLD chemically competent cells
-Non-transformed NEW chemically competent cells
Redid bacterial infection
-For both samples, we used ER2738 (not from the same ‘O/N’ (also, not a real O/N))
-Infected one sample with isolated ‘Litmus28i phage’ and one with ‘pSB1C3-M13ori’
-Alterations to protocol
Did not started from saturated O/N. Started each with a colony, waited several hours until at OD ~1. We then added these cells to fresh 50mL LB to have an OD of 0.1.
Missed the 30 minute infection mark. Infected for ~45 minutes.
-Plated on Kan and Amp (Litmus28i sample) or Chlor (pSB1C3-M13ori sample) at dilutions of
1:100, 1:1k, 1:10k, and 1:100k
6/17
Q5 PCR to replace KanR with ZeoR in M13K07
-Used recommendations
-Unfortunately, I (Jo) don’t know the difference between tightening and loosening the thermocycler lid; therefore, our M13K07 sample to amplify the M13K07 genes evaporated. But that’s ok, because we were sick of Zeocin anyway and decided mid-PCR to not waste our time with a Gibson Assembly and transformation. Instead we will be using the Old-School method of digestion and ligation because let’s face it, it’s a classic (and Gibson sucks) =)

-We consider the Litmus 28i to have been a success. The pSB1C3-M13ori …. not so much. Looking back at the Litmus28i and the M13K07, we noticed that the M13ori is facing the opposite direction as the plasmid ori. Ours faces the same direction as the plasmid ori. Because we are working with phagemids that are single stranded, we think that by flipping the M13ori, we may be able to recover functionality. We will also look into other reasons.

Primers are in!
Cloning of pSB1C3-M13ori(New)
-PCR to amplify M13ori (packaging signal) from Litmus 28i to be in the other direction
-Primers (Gem011 F&R) add cut sites to make part biobrick compatible
-Was able to gel extract
Band at the same size as sample….. contaminated primers?
-Then digested with E and P
-Digested pSB1C3 plasmid with E and P to linearize backbone
Was able to gel extract
1. Spill over from 2
2 and 3. pSB1C3 digested with EcoRI and PstI
-Insert <100bp so cannot be seen
4. M13ori
Ligation of M13ori (packaging signal) into pSB1C3
10h at 16C
20m at 80C
Hold at 4C
PCR to amplify M13K07 genes from M13K07 DNA isolated from phage
-Primers (Gem012 F&R) add cut sites to make part biobrick compatible
-Very light bands and not band might correlate with 6000pb but not enough resolution on gel to be certain. Bands were too light so did not extract
-Set up PCR again using Q5 to run O/N
Received only a feint, smudgy band that was too large. We did not bother with extracting the DNA
Test of 6/19 O/Ns (14 that are presumably pSB1C3-M13ori and 2 that are presumably M13K07)
-Mini-prepped all O/Ns
-Digested all with Pst-I (common RE between pSB1C3-M13ori and M13K07)
-Even though these are phagemids, we assumed that because they were still in the cell, the plasmids were still double stranded so could be recognized by RE. Our assumption was valid
-Results of digestion
1,2,4-14: all had bands that corresponded to pSB1C3-M13ori cut once
3: Slight band at expected size but very feint
15, 16: as expected, they contain bands of ~9000bp, correlating with the M13K07 phagemid. Interestingly, sample 15 also contained a (brighter) band that corresponds with pSB1C3-M13ori. We assume that this was an incident of double infection (chance or did this occur at high frequency?)
Check table from 6/19 for more details
-1-14: pSB1C3-M13ori
-15-16: M13K07 from 1:1k diluted plate
6/21
Needed to transform our pSB1C3-M13ori(New) (6/20) into cells. First, we transformed into 5alpha cells; however, we need to infect these cells later in order to make phage. Our 5alphas are not competent so we repeated the transformation, this time using ER2738 cells which contain the F’ episome, allowing us to infect with the M13 phage.
-Also transformed sample #1 from 6/20 mini-preps (pSB1C3-M13ori(Old) into ER2738 cells. Do not see any notes about this plasmid being in infectable cells during the initial experiment. Reason for experiment failure???
Ran 6/20 O/N PCR (to amplify M13K07 genes) on gel (also re-ran the previous sample from the day with more DNA)
-Still, band looks too big. Brightest band still occurs between 8000 and 9000bp. Lighter band around 7000bp-- might be ~6000pb but too light to tell
Alternative plan for amplifying M13K07 genes
-Digest sample with PstI (cuts outside of the target region)
Used sample #16 from 6/20 b/c it is double stranded so will cut
-PCR amplified the linearized digestion product
1. PCR of M13genes
2. PCR of M13genes + DMSO
Gel extracted pieces boxed in red
-Used primers Gem012 F&R
-Gel extracted piece but received very low yield
Alternative to alternative plan for amplifying M13K07 genes
-Digested with PstI and AgeI
1. Cut with PstI and AgeI
2. Uncut
3. Cut with PstI

Digested samples (E+P)
Started phage amplification protocol
-Amount of phage added = 10.9ul of 1:10 diluted phage (M13 phage (1) from 5/24 (4.575 x10^12 phage/mL)) to a final concentration of 1x10^8 phage/mL in 50mL
-Managed to get both samples to the 14-28hr incubation
6/25
Checked mini-prep samples from 6/24 (pSB1C3-M13genes)
Ran the digestion overnight (6/24 to 6/25)
-All contained a band at 2000bp. Mostly empty vector or contained small, light band. Sample 1 had prominent band at ~1250bp.
-None of samples contained M13genes
M13K07 is on P15A ori (10-12 copy number) whereas the pSB1C3 ori is on pUC19 (500-700 copies). It’s possible that this overexpression is detrimental to cell

Primers Gem013 came in. Resuspend and diluted primers
-O/N of pSB3C5 to use for PCR tomorrow
7/9
Wanted to make Litmus28i biobrick compatible for use as a phagemid backbone for us and other iGEM teams
-Mini-prepped O/N of pSB3C5
-PCR of pSB3C5 to amplify J04450 with Litmus28i compatible cut sites
Primers: Gem013
At the 3’ end, these primers are the same as VF2 and VR so will bind the region flanking J04450. This conserves the terminators that exist between the biobrick prefix and VF2 on one side and those between the biobrick suffix and VR on the other side. Therefore, we are amplifying, VF2 priming site, terminators, J04450, terminators, and VR priming site
At the 5’ end, these primers contain unique restriction sites found in the Litmus28i MCS
PCR of M13 genes…. again (did 4 samples)
-Used the 1:10000 dilutions

Results of 7/11 transformation
-No growth on no DNA control (Amp or Chlor)
-Lots of growth on Lit-J04450 -> some red-> colonies are too close together to prick individual colonies
-It’s possible that these red colonies are satellites =(
-Swiped some and plated on new Amp plate (restreak)
-Lawn of positive control (Litmus 28i) on Amp
-Many colonies for L1 (pSB3C5-M13genes) and L2 (pSB6A1-M13genes)
-Due to high number of red colonies on Lit-J04450 plate, we assumed that most of these colonies contain empty vector
-Did not make O/N
Ligated M13 genes to pSB6A1
-Used the remained of our digested M13genes.
-Both digestions from 7/10
Infection Experiment

Mini-prep
-pSC3C5-J04450 -- very little growth, low DNA yield
-Fd-CAT infected cells
Digest and run on a gel to verify presence of a band- there was a very feint band
Finished isolating phage…. messed up and used 0.8MgCl2, 0.2M NaCl instead of PEG during precipitation step. Also used the wrong phage
-Infected ER2738 cells anyway…. no growth by 8/12
Week 15
8/10
Are the progeny phage from 8/6 (original progeny from first Fd-Tet application) viable/ able to reproduce?
-Used these progeny to make phage that should amplify Fd-CAT phage containing either the Fd-CAT or Litmus28ibb-J04450 phagemid

Week 17
8/27
Transform pSB1C3-M13ori into ER2738 cells
8/28
Make phage with pSB1C3-M13ori as phagemid and M13g6A1 as helper phagemid
8/29
Finish phage isolation of M13 phage containing pSB1C3-M13ori
9/3
digest pSB6A1-M13g and pSB3C5 with EcoRI and PstI. Did not receive a band for M13genes so did not proceed with ligation to pSB3C5
Week 18
9/4
Mini-prepped new pSB6A1-M13genes (bad quality) and pSB3C5-J04550. Digested both plasmids with EcoRI and PstI and ran products on gel. Did receive a band for the M13genes but it was too feint to gel extract
9/5
Mini-prep pSB6A1-M13genes again. Digest this and pSB3C5 backbone from previous day with EcoRI and PstI. M14g band was barely bright enough to extract so we extracted M13genes and pSB3C5 backbone. Pieces were ligated together overnight at 16C for 10 hours.
9/7
Transformed 9/5 ligation (pSB3C5-M13genes into 5alpha cells). Plated sample onto low Chlor plate (34ug/mL)
9/9
Still no growth for 9/7 transformation of pSB3C5-M13genes ligation PCR M13genes to attempt another ligation into pSB3C5. Diluted DNA to ~1.17ng/ul
9/10
Gel of 9/9 PCR of M13genes looked clean (only ran 3ul of PCR sample on gel). PCR purified the remaining PCR sample. Digested with EcoRI and PstI. Ligated to previously digested pSB3C5.
Week 19
9/11
Transform 9/10 ligation (pSB3C5-M13genes) into 5alpha cells
9/13
Colony PCR of colonies that grew for 9/11 transformation. Looking for pSB3C5-M13genes)
9/15
Gel of colony PCR showed failure. Set up overnight cultures anyway.

Description
BBa_K1445000
M13ori- the packaging signal for the M13 and fd phage
Mini-prepped overnights from 9/15 and sent samples for sequencing
Sent Litmus28ibb-J04450 sample for sequencing to sequence the remaining section that was not reached before
Week 20
9/21
Up until this point, very little luck was had with pSB3C5. Retried putting M13genes onto a chloramphenicol backbone, but this time used pSB1C3. Digested M13genes and pSB1C3 with EcoRI and PstI. Gel showed incomplete digestion so did not gel extract.
9/22
Digested pSB1C3-J04450 with EcoRI and PstI then gel extracted the backbone. PCR purified M13genes(PCR product was clean so did not bother to gel extract). Ligated the two pieces together.
9/23
Transform ligations from 9/22 (pSB1C3-M13genes) into 5 alpha cells
9/27
Transform pSB1C3-M13genes into 5alpha cells. Plate onto low Chlor (34ug/mL)
Later in day.... Set up overnight cultures of colonies
9/28
Mini-prepped O/N cultures from 9/27. Digested samples with EcoRI and PstI. There were no bands of the correct size on the gel.
