Students
Julissa Duran-Malle
I am majoring in MCDB and Neuroscience. I am involved in all the experiments in the GOLD lab. I enjoy learning about other cultures, I plan on going to Tibet next summer
Daniel Garey
I am a junior student majoring in MCDB and Neuroscience. For the iGem I am doing dual infection project as well as the wiki. I am involved in designing and making two separate plasmids, each containing a part of the CRISPR Cas9 system, to be delivered individually by separate phage.  I enjoy backpacking and scuba diving and am fascinated by other cultures
Josephina Hendrix
I am a junior in Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology and Computer Science. For the iGEM project, I focus on the constitutive CRISPR-Cas9 and the phage delivery system.
Joshua Ivie
I am a senior majoring in MCDB. I am working with the Garcea group
Daren Kraft
I am a junior double majoring in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and Biochemistry.  My contributions to the iGEM project include concept and experiment design, CRISPR-Cas constructs, and drafting of cloning protocol. When not in the lab, I enjoy hiking, climbing, and camping.
Andrea Mariani
I am junior majoring in MCDB. I am focusing on dual infection as well as putting Cas9 and CRISPR on separate plasmids.
Alexander Martinez
I am a senior majoring in MCDB. Among my contributions to the projects are dual-infection experiments, Standford-Brown
Kirill Novik
I am  a senior majoring in MCDB and minoring in Computer Science. My contribution to the project is the wiki page. Outside of the lab, I am working in the Lowry lab studying genome of Mycobacterium vaccae utilizing various bioinformatics methods.
Kendra Shattuck
I am a senior majoring in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. My part on the iGEM project includes Interlab Measurement Study, Outreach,  and the CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid engineering.
Leighla Tayefeh
I am a senior double majoring in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and Neuroscience. Sythetic biology's vast potential to benefit society attracted me to join iGEM. I am involved in engineering a plasmid devoted to the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Outside of lab, I enjoy reading, hiking, and spending time with family and friends.
Justine Wagner
I am majoring MCDB and Biochemistry. I work in the Dowell lab alongside Jo (working with sythetic phagemid product). In addition to iGEM, I also conduct research in the Bowman research group with joint collaboration with Musgrave research group in which my major work consists of synthesizing various APO derived photo-initiators. When I graduate next year, I hope to be accepted into a top bioengineering graduate program where my research will be focused on either tissue engineering and/or bioartificial organ synthesis.
Rishabh Yadav
I am a junior in highschool. I am developing a computer program that searches the target sites for Cas9
Sarah Zimmermann
I am a senior majoring in MCDB. I am working on the dual infection project.
Advisors
Robin Dowell
The Dowell Lab focuses on developing informative, mechanistic models that unravel biologically meaningful information from a few individuals and limited reference information. We leverage comparative information to better understand both the diverse roles that non-coding transcripts play within the cell and the impact of variation on phenotype between closely related individuals.
Michael Brasino
I am a graduate student advisor in the materials science PhD program
Samantha O'Hara
I am a graduate student advisor in MCDB. I study polyomavirus-receptor interactions and I have a wonderful Labrador retriever named, Lucy.
Cloe Simmone Pogoda
I am a graduate student advisor in the molecular biology (MCDB) PhD program
Tim Read
I am a graduate student advisor in MCDB. I study transcriptional Evolution in the Dowell Lab
Alexander Stemm-Wolf
I am in the advising group for Gold group. I have 25 years of experience as a research technician, the last 15 in MCD Biology.
