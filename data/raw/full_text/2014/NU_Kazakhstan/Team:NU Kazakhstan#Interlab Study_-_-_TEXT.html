iGEM 2014 Measurement Interlab
Protocol
1. First we transformed E. coli Dh5alpha according to iGEM protocol with the following parts from iGEM distribution kit 2014:
BBa_I20260 (Plate 4, Well 18A)
BBa_J23101 (called BBa_K823005 when in pSB1C3): Plate 1, Well 20K
BBa_E0240 (in pSB1C3): Plate 2, Well 24B
BBa_J23115 (called BBa_K823012 when in pSB1C3): Plate 1, Well 22I
BBa_E0240 (in pSB1C3): Plate 2, Well 24B
2. After we observed the growth of transformed bacteria on chloramphenicol selective plates, each part was extracted using PureLink® HiPure Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Invitrogen, catalog number K2100-02). The concentration of the plasmids was checked with Nanodrop.
PCR of the parts was done according to the following protocol for 20ul reaction (adapted from http://www.thermoscientificbio.com/uploadedFiles/Resources/tech-manual-f-531-f-532-phusion-high-fidelity-pcr-master-mix.pdf):
Sterile water – 4ul, high fidelity master mix – 10ul, VF2 primer – 2ul, VR primer – 2ul, DNA from miniprep (final concentration in the reaction=0.2ng/ul) – 2ul.
Thermocycler program for the parts was adapted from http://www.thermoscientificbio.com/uploadedFiles/Resources/tech-manual-f-531-f-532-phusion-high-fidelity-pcr-master-mix.pdf and the extension time was adjusted according to the size of the part (25s per 1000bp).

Part construction
We used protocols provided for endonucleases from Invitrogen and Fermentas for restriction digest. Furthermore, we used circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC).
Protocol for restriction digest of BBa_J23101 and BBa_J23115 (separately): DNA (PCR product) – 10ul, sterile water – 17ul, 10xTango buffer – 2ul, SpeI (Fermentas) – 1ul. Incubate the reactions for 2 hours at 370C.
Protocol for restriction digest of BBa_E0240:
DNA from pcr – 8ul, sterile water – 17ul, 10xM buffer – 2ul, 0.1% BSA – 2ul, XbaI (Invitrogen) – 1ul. Incubate the reaction for 2 hours at 370C.
Protocol for CPEC for inserting promoter and GFP into backbone for one 25ul reaction (Quan J, Tian J (2009) Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning of Complex Gene Libraries and Pathways. PLoS ONE 4(7): e6441. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006441)
Reaction mixture:
Linearized plasmid backbone – 4ul
Promoter digested with SpeI – 2ul
BBa_E0240 digested with XbaI – 2ul
High Fidelity master mix (Invitrogen) – 11.75ul
DMSO – 0.75ul
Sterile water – 4.5ul
Construct 1: BBa_J23101+ BBa_E0240 (size of the part together with the PSB1C3 backbone is 2981: 2070bp+35bp+876bp)
Construct 2: BBa_J23115 +BBa_E0240 (size of the part together with the PSB1C3 backbone is 2981: 2070bp+35bp+876bp)
Setting the program for Thermocycler: 30s - 98C, 10s - 98C, 30s - 55C, 45s (15s/kb) - 72C, 15 cycles, 10min - 72C
Results: We observed the bands of the expected sizes on the gel, which means that the desired incorporation did occur (Figure 3).

To check the expression of the constructed parts we transformed E. coli Dh5alpha with CPEC products and grew the bacteria on LB agar plates with chloramphenicol. After the growth of the colonies was observed, a single colony of bacteria was inoculated into 5ml of  LB medium with the appropriate antibiotic concentration and IPTG:
Bacteria with BBa_I20260 into 5ml LB, 1mM IPTG and 30ug/ml Kanamycin
Bacteria with Construct 1 into 5ml LB, 1mM IPTG and 35ug/ml Chloramphenicol
Bacteria with Construct 2 into 5ml LB, 1mM IPTG and 35ug/ml Chloramphenicol
Control (Bacteria with BBa_J45014) into 5ml LB, 1mM IPTG and 35ug/ml Chloramphenicol
The cultures were incubated for 20 hours at 200rpm at 370C. The cultures were put into 96-well Corning, flat bottom plate were used and GFP intensity was measured with Thermo Scientific Varioskan® Flash

Layout of 96-well Corning, flat bottom plate. 18a represents the existing device BBa_I20260 (J23101-B0032-E0040-B0015) in the pSB3K3 vector from Plate 4, Well 18A; 200, 175, and 150 are volume of liquid cultures in each well in microliters (175ul were mixed with 25ul of LB medium, 150ul – with 50ul of LB); blank is LB medium.
Photometric and fluorometric measurements were recorded and analyzed.
The measurements were taken on Varioskan according to the protocol below:
After the measurements were taken, the analysis of the data obtained was done.
