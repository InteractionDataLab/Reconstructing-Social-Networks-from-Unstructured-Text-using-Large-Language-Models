All about safety in our labs
How we learned it:
What we learned:
Minimizing risks:
We were not only trained by our faculty and Teaching Assistants how to work at labs, how to use the equipment, chemical and biological material, but we also got special safety training online: CITIPROGRAM
We learned about general safety in labs (fire and emergency cases, prevention of injuries, working with the laboratory equipment). Also we learned how to work with bacterial cultures, and we learneded how to work with some hazardous chemicals.
We minimized the risk by removing the direct use of bacteria in diagnostics procedure. Instead, the nanobody necessary for diagnostics will be obtain from bacterial secretion and carefully purified using Ni/NTA column, so that only proteins containing His-tag will be obtained, thus excluding the presence of any toxins.
