Mukhtar Sadykov
"Feel the energy in the air"
I am a current leader of our team. My areas of interest are synthetic biology, bioinformatics and immunology. Briefly about one, I took introduciton into immunology course last year; since then I have plunged into the fascinating science of permanent war within our bodies. My favourite players in this war are the complement system and cell-mediated immunity.
In my free time I like running and doing tai chi. Also, books and friends are among my best companions.
Banu Ospanova
"True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us. (Socrates)"
I am a Junior majoring in Biological Sciences at Nazarbayev University, Astana. I am planning to pursue a medical education. To be honest, I have never thought of becoming a physician until my final year at high school. It was the turning point in my life as in lives of many other school graduates; it was the time to decide. After giving much thought to my plans for the future, I realized that the profession a person chooses should be worth spending the most of his/her life. For me it is life sciences and medicine. I want to become a physician, who will be able to do clinical research, understand the disease with all the underlying mechanisms, and to be able to tackle the problem in the most advantageous for a patient way.
A person may only guess what his or her strong sides are unless he/she gets involved in various activities. That is the reason I am using all the available opportunities to improve, to learn, to practice and to enjoy. iGEM is an invaluable experience for me...
Alexandr Pak
"What can be more interesting than studying life, and what can be more important than learning the art of healing."
Alexandr is a senior student at NU majoring in Biomedical sciences. He plans to pursue MD/PhD degree and conduct cool research experiments. He likes listening music, doing sport and explore new things.
Luiza Niyazmetova
"In any field, find the strangest thing and then explore it"
Luiza is a Senior student at Nazarbayev University majoring in Biological Sciences. She is sincerely excited about being a part of iGEM, that is why she is trying to contribute as much as possible in this project. In the future, Luiza plans to become a very good physician-scientist, thus she prepares to enter a Medical School.

"Never give up!"
Zeinaf is 4th year undergraduate students, majoring in Biomedical Sciences. She is planning to take MD and work on the field of Maternal and Childhood Health Care. She sees herself as a physician-scientist, working on improving this field in Kazakhstan. First time in IGEM, and she really enjoys it!
Samat Bayakhmetov
"Do what you must, and you will never lose!”"
My name is Samat. I am senior student majoring in biomedical sciences. Right now I am taking Intro to Immunology, and IGEM helps me to apply my theoretical knowledge in practice. I like playing soccer and my favorite team is Arsenal from London. Just like in soccer, in order for team to succeed, all of the players must be committed to their role and perform their best on given position.
Nikita Tsyba
Nikita is 3rd year biology student. His research interests are Neuroscience and Stroke treatment.
Azhar Zhailauova
"Everything done with heart will give result"
I am a second year student majoring Biology. My great goal is to become a physician-scientist, the person who changes the life of people making it better every day. To build happiness little by little...as a magician. I am waiting for becoming a real one.
Altynay Abdirakhmanova
"The future is never the way we imagined it"
Hello everyone! I am Altynay. I am majoring in Biological Sciences in Nazarbayev University. I am grateful for the chance to take an education, be a member of the IGEM NU Kazakhstan team and grateful for the summer period with IGEM.
I know that the future is never the way we imagined it. But, I believe that true passion to science   and intrinsic desire to help people will make our world a kind place to live. In the future, I want   to see that my country will be able to offer high quality and effective treatment for every citizen.
I want to say big thanks with whole sincerity to Luiza Niyazmetova for sharing her experience,   knowledge and passion for the science.
Dana Stambekova
""Seeing the goal and not the obstacles we get where we want to""
I am Sophomore student at Nazarbayev University majoring Chemistry. Why did I participate in IGEM? Because I like team works! Such projects give great opportunities to share your knowledge and get new experience. I was happy to participate in IGEM, to develop professional skills, and meet new friends. IGEM gave me ability to see the laboratory work inside.
I prefer to spend free time with my family and friends. I like to read books and listen to classical music. In the future I want to develop science in Kazakhstan, benefit my country, and make my family proud of me!
Our mentors
Dr. Tim Shipley
Tim Shipley completed his doctorate in immunology with a project focused on identifying immune responses to Pneumocystisas mediators for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)development.  In his postdoctoral work, he worked at the Starzl Transplant Institute at the University of Pittsburgh characterizing exhausted cells in pediatric transplant patients who have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).  He also worked in industry for several years on developing a vaccine for HIV using gene gun technology.  Now, as an assistant professor at Nazarbayev University, he works tirelessly to inspire undergraduate and graduate students that immunology is the most awesome biological science known to mankind.  Also, he might be Spiderman.
Arnat Balabayev
Arnat graduated from Purdue University. Currently, he is working on Microtubule dynamics in cancer cells at Nazarbayev University Research and Innovation System.
