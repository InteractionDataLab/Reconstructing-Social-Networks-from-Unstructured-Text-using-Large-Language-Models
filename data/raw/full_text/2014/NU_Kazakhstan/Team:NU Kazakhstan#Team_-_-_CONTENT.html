My areas of interest are synthetic biology, bioinformatics and immunology. Briefly about one, I took introduciton into immunology course last year; since then I have plunged into the fascinating science of permanent war within our bodies. My favourite players in this war are the complement system and cell-mediated immunity.</P><P>In my free time I like running and doing tai chi. Also, books and friends are among my best companions.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="smallbox"><DIV class="flleft"><DIV style="text-align:center;"><B class="name">Banu Ospanova</B><I>&quot;True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us. (Socrates)&quot;</I></DIV><P>I am a Junior majoring in Biological Sciences at Nazarbayev University, Astana. I am planning to pursue a medical education. To be honest, I have never thought of becoming a physician until my final year at high school. It was the turning point in my life as in lives of many other school graduates; it was the time to decide. After giving much thought to my plans for the future, I realized that the profession a person chooses should be worth spending the most of his/her life. For me it is life sciences and medicine. I want to become a physician, who will be able to do clinical research, understand the disease with all the underlying mechanisms, and to be able to tackle the problem in the most advantageous for a patient way.</P><P>A person may only guess what his or her strong sides are unless he/she gets involved in various activities. That is the reason I am using all the available opportunities to improve, to learn, to practice and to enjoy. iGEM is an invaluable experience for me... </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="smallbox"><DIV class="flleft"><DIV style="text-align:center;"><B class="name">Alexandr Pak</B><I>&quot;What can be more interesting than studying life, and what can be more important than learning the art of healing.&quot;</I></DIV>

Tim Shipley completed his doctorate in immunology with a project focused on identifying immune responses to Pneumocystisas mediators for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)development.  In his postdoctoral work, he worked at the Starzl Transplant Institute at the University of Pittsburgh characterizing exhausted cells in pediatric transplant patients who have developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).  He also worked in industry for several years on developing a vaccine for HIV using gene gun technology.  Now, as an assistant professor at Nazarbayev University, he works tirelessly to inspire undergraduate and graduate students that immunology is the most awesome biological science known to mankind.  Also, he might be Spiderman.
