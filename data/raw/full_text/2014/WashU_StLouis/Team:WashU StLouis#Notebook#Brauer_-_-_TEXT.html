Day 8. 6/11/2014 (Wednesday)
●      Plan to do: Moon Lab Group meeting at 3PM. Work on finishing Gel DNA extraction, Dpn1, Purification, then One-Pot, then finally Transformation and plating (2 LB/cm plates). [Realization! We discovered today that in order for the ccaS/ccaR light system to function correctly, we need the PCC6803 genes ho1 and pcyA which are needed to heme into PCB (a chromophore) via a two step oxidation/reduction process. Ray is working on this aspect and we are planning to help/take over this part of his work. Our plan is to still transform plasmid PBJ and send it off for sequencing to make sure we have our designed plasmid. The next step would be to co-transform the two plasmids, one containing the ho1 and pcyA genes and the plasmid PBJ into E. coli and after sending off for sequencing, test the light promoter system. ]
●      Got done: Finished Gel DNA extraction and measured concentration using nanoquant tecan. Did not need to do Dpn1 nor purification. Put in one-pot after 12 noon. Transformed and incubated O/N. PCR for Ray’s Biobrick plasmid for ho1 and pcyA parts.

Day 9. 6/12/2014 (Thursday)
●      Plan to do: Gel extract, one-pot for Ray’s plasmid then transform and plate. pick PBJ002 colonies, start O/N liquid cultures. Work on negative and pos. control once primers arrive (check around noon). Also, grow a culture of Ray’s BbaP DNA (AmpR) as well as Cheryl’s pTet 100-T (where we get the TetR from)
            Plan out seq PCR for PBJ002.
●      Got done: Gel extract and one pot for Ray’s plasmid. Re-ran PCR for Rays BbaP (SpeC_AraC_Bba) plasmid. Gel extract on new BbaP part. Did not yield bands- only saw a smear.

Observe which PCR product in gel (which lane from tube) is of the right length.
Purify PCR product.
Send miniprepped plasmid 
AND
