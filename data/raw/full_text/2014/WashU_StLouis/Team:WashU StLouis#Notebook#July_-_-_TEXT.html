Notebook     |     June     |     August     |     School Year
Week Five- June 30- July 6
Team starts re-culturing the strains in more nutritious LB media.  Prepare 50% glycerol solution for storage and autoclaved water as well as the M9 medium. Caroline continues to work on scripts and outreach videos. Growth of all strains is significantly improved.
Brauer Group has not had success with chromophore plasmid yet, redesigned the plasmid by piecing together different components. Started with cloning of proposed hybrid promoter and sent in for sequence verification.
Website worked on compiling notebook and log information.
Had our third worldly Wednesday at Gyro House- Mediterranean cuisine.
Week Six- July 7-13
After series of culturing testing, the best media, optimal nitrogen source, optimal carbon source, optimal temperature for culturing are all determined. C-source: Glucose. N-source: Glutamate. Culturing Media: LB. Testing Media: M9. Temperature: 30 Celsius (Anaerobic).  
Brauer group continued work on chromophore plasmid. Started design of experimentation without the chromophore as a sanity check. Ptet promoter seemed to be giving our plasmids issues as it did not fluoresce as expected. Contacted Tabor group for possibly shipping the plasmid to WashU.
Website created footer along with sponsors banner.
Had a mid summer progress report meeting with the professors and explained to them our work's progress and difficulties we faced.
Had our fourth Worldly Wednesday at Asian Kitchen- Korean cuisine.
Week Seven- July 14-20
Before the formal examination (Acetylene Reduction Assay) for the nitrogenase activity, the team performed plasmid extraction and gel running to confirm the existence of plasmid inside the strains.
Brauer Group worked on cloning for degradation tags and other side projects. Continued conversations with shipping plasmid to WashU and also found a promising Biobrick part and ordered from the registry.
Website start to incorporate videos onto the site.
Ben also started working on a math model of our system with Brandon.
Week Eight- July 21-27
Rebstock group ran the Acetylene Reduction Assay with GC machine for all strains including negative control. Specific procedure can be found in protocol.
Brauer group received the biobrick part and started cloning a new plasmid for the chromophore part, and sent in for sequencing.
Ben continued work on math model with Brandon by sending necessary information to him and writing ODEs.
Website worked on formatting layout. Added floating menu to certain pages. Created front page for deadlines
The team had our fifth worldly Wednesday at De Palm Tree- Jamaican cuisine... spicy!!
Week Nine- July 28- August 3
Continued Acetylene Reduction Assays for all strains and controls.
Brauer group continued troubleshooting of chromophore plasmid. And sent off degradation tag plasmids for sequencing as well. Designed an experiment for light induction by co-transforming chromophore plasmids and light regulation plasmids. Make necessary plates for experiment and started growing cultures for experimentation.
Website started adding content to the various pages
