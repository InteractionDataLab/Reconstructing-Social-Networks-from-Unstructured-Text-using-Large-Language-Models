CPEC (Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning) Protocol – Andrew Ng
Design primers that include overhangs for fragments that you want to assemble by hand or using a program such as Snapgene (these primers can also be used for Gibson assembly)
Using Phusion polymerase, PCR each insert as well as your plasmid backbone and verify on a gel.
IMPORTANT- it is highly recommended that you optimize your PCR protocol (either using temperature gradient or DMSO) so that only one band can be seen in your PCR
Digest PCR product using DpnI (digests methylated DNA)
If PCR was performed using Phusion polymerase from NEB, you can
Add the DpnI enzyme from NEB directly. For this, I add 1 ul of enzyme to 50 ul of PCR product and incubate for 3 hours or more 4. PCR purify your inserts,
NOTE: if you were unable to get a single band in your PCR, you might consider gel purification if you can get enough yield
Using a 2:1 molar ratio of insert to vector (if you did not PCR purify, I would just eyeball concentrations based on length of parts and darkness of band in gel), make your CPEC reaction as follows:
4 ul HF Buffer
0.4 ul dNTPs
.1 ul Phusion Polymerase
Insert
Vector
Fill to 20 ul with dH20
(Note for this step: The more DNA you have available to use here the better. I would recommend using a maximum of between 8-10 ul of DNA in total though due to the salt content)
Use the following thermal cycler protocol (or just navigate to CPEC in the folder labeled Andrew in the BioRad C1000)
98.0C for 30s
98.0C for 10s
Ramp to 55.0C at a rate of 0.1C/s
55.0C for 30s
72.0 C for 30s/kb of construct
Repeat 1-5 for 10-30 cycles (depending on the “complexity” of your assembly)
g. 72.0 C for 10 min
￼Transform cells with 2-5ul of CPEC mix
