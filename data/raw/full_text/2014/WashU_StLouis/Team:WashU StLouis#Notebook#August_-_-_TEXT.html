Week Ten- August 4-10
Continued Acetylene Reduction Assay for all strains and controls.
Ran light induction experiment and troubleshoot data based on results. Started design of a new positive control to more accurately find out what is wrong with our system.
Had our final Worldly Wednesday at Blueberry Hill before people started leaving campus before school starts.
Website rearranged formatting of the basic page. Change color scheme and background.
Jeffrey left the team for the summer to go abroad.
Week Eleven- August 11-17
Presented our preliminary results to Pakrasi Group and all of the advisors.
Ben started and tested new positive control and found that it did not fluoresce as expected and suspect a faulty RBS. Started design of primers to modify the RBS of the system.
Week Twelve- August 25 - 31
School year started.
Rebstock group continued to use acetylene reduction assay to test nitrogen fixation activity of JM109 and WM1788 under known optimal conditions.
Meanwhile Rebstock group started to plan specific protocol and design for BioBricking the nif plasmid.
Ben starting cloning project to test whether switching the rbs to a comparable one would fix the EYFP expression in the light plasmids. He sent the clones in for sequencing. Ben also worked on the title and abstract for the iGEM September 1st deadline.
