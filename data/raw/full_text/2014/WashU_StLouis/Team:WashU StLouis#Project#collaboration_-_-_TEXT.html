We also collaborated with the University of Virginia's iGEM Team by helping them distribute their survey! For more information, contact them at virginia.igem@gmail.com
We also helped to characterize a few parts from the registry:
BBa_M30109
BBa_M30109 does NOT work AT ALL. Digesting the plasmid with the iGEM restriction enzyme yields the right band lengths but other than that the sequence is junk. We tried on numerous occasions to assemble a plasmid to activate our light sensor system. This set us back half of the summer because of the faulty part. We found a new part on the registry with the same genes that showed slightly more promise. 
BBa_K1017726
BBa_K1017726 digests with the iGEM restriction enzymes well. We were able to assemble a plasmid by swapping out ori and resistance (we needed a different antibiotic) in order to co-transform with our system. There is differentiable results between our light and dark system, so the part likely has the genes as reported. However, digestion with known restriction enzyme sites based off the sequence provided gave gel smears rather than clear bands, so not 100% convinced that this part is as advertised.
