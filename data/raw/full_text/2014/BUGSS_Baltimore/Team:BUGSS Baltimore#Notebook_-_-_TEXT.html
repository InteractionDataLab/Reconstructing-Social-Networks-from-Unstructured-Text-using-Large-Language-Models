Pfu cloning and biobricking project
Reference: Heo and Kim 2013. African Journal of Microbiology Research. 7(9) pp 745-750.
Primers ordered from Invitrogen and brought up in 100 microliters water, split into two aliquots one placed     in iGEM box in lab freezer, remaining in storage freezer
Primers: Pfu N- ATGATTTTAGATGTGGATTACATAACTG   concentration=208 microMolar, Tm (50mM NaCl)= 58              Pfu C- CTAGGATTTTTTAATGTTAAGCCAGG     Concentration=200 microMolar, Tm (50mM NaCl)= 60
Pfu Nde   GGGAGCCATATGATTTTAGATGTGGATTACATA  concentration=240 microMolar, Tm (50mM NaCl)=68              Pfu 1001R CCATAAAGGTTGTCCAACTAATCTTG         concentration=172 microMolar, Tm (50mM NaCl)=61              Pfu 911R  CCTTGAGAGAGTTGCCAAATACTCG          concentration=188 microMolar, Tm (50mM NaCl)=65              Pfu Xho   TCTATCGCTCGAGTAGGATTTTTTAATGTTAAGCCA concentration=204 microMolar, Tm (50mM NaCl)=71
First PCR conditions: Template 2.5 microliter Pfu enzyme mix                        Pfu-N    1.2 microliter of 1:10 dilution                        Pfu-C    1.2 microliter of 1:10 dilution                        dNTP     1.0 microliter of 10mM                        Buffer   5.0 microliter                        Enzyme   none in rxn1, 1.0 microliter Pfusion in rxn 2                        H2O      to 50 microliters
Positive control    Used E. coli genomic DNA and 16S primers to check function of enzyme and reagents   Negative control    Water in place of template DNA
PCR program                     Step 1  95 - 5 min                     Step 2  95 - 40 sec                     Step 3  60 - 40 sec                     Step 4  72 - 3 min                         Go To step 2 40X                     Step 5  72 - 10 min                      Step 6  4 - forever

You should make use of the calendar feature on the wiki and start a lab notebook. This may be looked at by the judges to see how your work progressed throughout the summer. It is a very useful organizational tool as well.
