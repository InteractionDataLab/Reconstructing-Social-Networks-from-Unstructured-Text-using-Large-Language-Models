Judging Criteria
We have registered our team NJU-QIBEBT.
We have set up a wonderful team wiki.
We have prepared a poster and a presentation, which we will be presenting at the Jamboree.
We have submitted several new BioBricks to the Parts Registry, see Submitted Parts for more information.
Several of our BioBricks work as expected. Click here to learn more.
Our team members paid a lot for our project. You can see their jobs here .
We also helped some teams to finish their works.
We went to the factory and tried to apply what we studied to practice.
We are trying to overcome the difficulties brought by ethic problems we faced in China.
We have applied for 4 patents:
1. A kind of engineered E.coli to detect the concentration of fatty acid
2. A method of producing unsaturated fatty acid in engineered E.coli
3. A method of producing fatty acid of short carbon length in engineered E.coli
4. A method of producing fatty acid of long carbon length in engineered E.coli
We are waiting for the authorizations from Patent Office of the People's Republic of China.
