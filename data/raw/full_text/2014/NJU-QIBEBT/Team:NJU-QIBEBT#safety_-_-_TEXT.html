SAFETY
Overview
We carried out our project in the M3 laboratory, Nanjing University. All of our work was completed in bio-safety level (BSL) 1 labs. Some of the parts we used in the project were extracted from E. Coli and the others were supported by the QIBEBT which posed no detriment to the researchers and environment when handled under the basic bio-safety guidelines.
Laboratory safety
Researcher safety
All the experiments were performed according to the laboratory safety regulations of Nanjing University.  And all the members were trained for the knowledge and skills which may be involved in the experiments to guarantee their safety and health. The cell we used in every experiment is harmless to the experimenters. EB was used in the electrophoresis, we are fully alert to it. We strictly follow the protocol and avoid careless operation.
Gene safety
There are five main genes were used in our project: AtFatA, BTE, MsbA, fasbA and fabB. First of all, we use fabA and fabB to control the saturation levels of FFAs. In fact, the two genes are the gene of E. coli , we just enhance the concentration in our engineering E.coli to produce extra products. What’s more, we use the promoter to control the gene and make sure it would not be overused. Gene MsbA is under the same regulation.
To produce FFA of different length, we utilized AtFatA from Arabidopsis thaliana and BTE from U. californica. Even though the two genes are transformed into our engineering E.coli from other species, there are homologous genes in every species actually. What’s more, E.coli can generate FFA naturally and the FFA is a kind of natural products in nature.
Operation safety
Every researcher must wear rubber glove and lab-gown before operating in the laboratory. Any experimental apparatus must be operated according to the safety rules. When using the UV lamp, we attach great importance to the protection on our eyes and skin.
The operation of super clean bench:
In order to maintain the state of sterility, anything that did not relate to the work in the super clean bench is forbidden to be put into the bench.
Before using the super clean bench, light it with UV lamp for the purpose of sterilizing the bacteria.
After cleaning your hand with alcohol, you must be careful for the alcohol lamp.
When using super clean bench，the fan should keep on.
Public safety
We have designed the eukaryotic circuit, which cannot be expressed by procaryotic microorganisms. And the cell we used is very fragile and it will soon die when leaving the culture medium. So it will not bring contamination to the environment.
The general public has no access into our lab without permission. If they are willing to learn about our lab and our project, we will guide them to ensure their safety.
