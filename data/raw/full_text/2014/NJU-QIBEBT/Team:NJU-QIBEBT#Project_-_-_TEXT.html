Project Description
Content
Fatty acids are an important kind of chemical for multiple uses. Fatty acids of different carbon chain length and saturation level can be widely applied to industry, food, medicine, health and many other aspects. Most of fatty acids are produced by animal grease or plant oil currently. However, the processes of oil production are limited by seasonal, regional and many other factors. Besides that, the cost of producing is so high that they can not be produced massively. For this reason, we should find an improved way to produce fatty acids.
Thioesterase, a key enzyme for synthesizing fatty acids in cells, are extensively spread in animals, plants and microorganisms. Fatty acid desaturase, a key enzyme for catalyzing unsaturated fatty acid production, exists in almost all creatures. We will utilize some kinds of operon structure to regulate different kinds of thioesterases and desaturases’ expression in order to produce fatty acids in a controlled manner.
To detect the fatty acid producing status in E.coli conveniently, we can design a fluorescence system composed of Transcriptional Regulatory Protein FadR to monitor the concentration of E.coli in the system.
By the ways listed above, we can accomplish the switch between production of different kinds of fatty acids by applying different signals to operons and detect the real time production status of E.coli by fluorescence report. Thus, we can obtain a very powerful cell factory by a series of gene transformations.

iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you though about your project and what works inspired you.

Conclusions
It's important for teams to describe all the creativity that goes into an iGEM project, along with all the great ideas your team will come up with over the course of your work.
It's also important to clearly describe your achievements so that judges will know what you tried to do and where you succeeded. Please write your project page such that what you achieved is easy to distinguish from what you attempted.
