Zhu Qizhang, 朱琪璋
Hello, I am Zhu Qizhang from Nanjing university. Synthetic biology fascinates me because creating something new and applying it to practical use can bring me a great sense of achievement. Stay hungry, stay foolish. I believe I can go further in the field of biology.                 What you didn’t expected could be what you really want.

Ouyang_Li，欧阳丽
I am Ouyang Li. As for me, it is a creative project which enriches my whole lives this summer.  I really appreciate this opportunity to immerse myself in experiments, which integrate my imagination of the design for magical bacterium. Furthermore, I so admire the charm of synthetic biology. It seems that I can achieve self-realization from zero to hero during this process.
