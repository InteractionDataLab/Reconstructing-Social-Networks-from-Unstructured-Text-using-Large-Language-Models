Helping Other Teams:
iGEM 2014 is the firsr time that NUDT_China and NJAU_China to take part in the iGEM. We gave them several lectures to help them know more about iGEM and gave them some advice.
We helped the team NUDT_China in their topic revision and provided them with some advice and suggestions on topic revision. We play an important role in their topic decision. Meanwhile, we also received some precious advice on how to improve our own project from them. We benefit each other in a mutual way. In order to support their work, we offered some parts they required to them.
We also offered some iGEM parts to XMU-China to help them finish their job.
