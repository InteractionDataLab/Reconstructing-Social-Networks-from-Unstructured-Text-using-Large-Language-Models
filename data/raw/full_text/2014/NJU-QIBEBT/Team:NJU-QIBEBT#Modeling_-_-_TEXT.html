Model
In order to predict the status of fatty acid production in E.coli, this model takes the red fluorescence and the green fluorescence generated from the bacteria as the qualitative indexes for the preliminary judgment. We then measured the protein expression of RFP and GFP to get a more accurate quantitative relationship and this can be regarded as a reflection for the fatty acid concentration in E.coli.
Multiple regression analysis can be used for studying the relationship between the independent variable  and the dependent variable Y. Suppose that there is a linear correlation between Y and , then the data we got can fit this regression model as followed:
