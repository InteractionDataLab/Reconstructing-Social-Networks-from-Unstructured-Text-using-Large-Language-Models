Math Book
Our Math Book is meant to be the mathematical modeling equivalent of a lab book, where we store everything another team might need to recreate our models. You can access code related to the models can be accessed from this GitHub page .
We hope you enjoy learning more about our model on the subpages!
We created mathematical models of the three main aspects of the Staphylocide system: CRISPR Interference , RNA Interference and Conjugation and have created sub-pages for each of them that detail all the steps in our analysis.
