Staphylocide
Delivery of an Antibiotic Resistance Gene Silencing Mechanism to a MRSA Population using Bacterial Conjugation
Problem
MRSA is sweeping the nation, an antibiotic-resistant scourge migrating from hospitals into communities. We need a hero to fight it and Waterloo iGEM has designed a synthetic bacterium that just might do the trick...
Solution
...Staphylocide! Staphylocide delivers antibiotic resistance gene silencing in vivo and could one day be incorporated into a treatment that would help doctors defeat MRSA once and for all.
 
Project Cornerstones
Explore the three cornerstones of this year's project: delivering the silencing in vivo using conjugation, silencing mecA expression using CRISPRi and sRNA and translating from the lab to the patients.
