The Hendrix College IGEM team was founded in the spring of this year, 2014, in Conway, Arkansas. We initially learned about the IGEM competition through a genetics lab, where we used a sample kit of BioBricks to create simple biological machines. We are an interdisciplinary group, made up of several different majors, and each person's skillset and knowledge is invaluable to the team as a whole. Our goal for this year is to do a creative, challenging, and useful project which will hopefully benefit the lives of others and create further interest in IGEM and biological engineering at our college.

I believe that the future of medicine and biology as a whole lies in our ability to understand and manipulate the genetic codes. In my spare time I fight crime as Jean Grey.</P></DIV><DIV class="member_right"><H4> Alex McIntyre </H4><P> Hey! I'm Alex, and I'm a Junior Psychology Major/Biology Minor from Fayetteville, Arkansas. I love all things medicine, and so naturally have my heart set on medical school. Other than academics, I'm active in my school's social committee and student senate. My two favorite things in the world are sleep and pugs. I was known for being the control freak in lab, but I like to think of myself as a perfectionist.​ I'm excited to not only be a part of the first team from Hendrix to compete at iGEM, but also from Arkansas! In my spare time I fight crime as Iceman.</P></DIV><DIV class="member_left"><H4> Jordan Spennato </H4><P> I’m a Health Science (Physical Therapy emphasis) major and Spanish minor at Hendrix College. In the future, I hope to complement physical therapy with art therapy as a means to help people achieve a more complete healing. I’ve begun this integration with my thesis, studying the effect of expressive art on the psychological well-being of injured athletes.
Working on Hendrix’s iGEM team is attractive to me because the procedure is a sort of artistic expression in the medical field; each team has creative license in designing their own project, fashioning a “genetic mosaic” to address a problem of our world. In my spare time I fight crime as X-23.</P></DIV><DIV class="member_right"><H4> Noah Beggs </H4><P> I am a senior biology major this year and transferred to Hendrix last fall. I first became interested in IGEM through a genetics lab with Dr. Murray, where we worked with a sample kit of BioBricks. The next semester (this past spring) an official IGEM team was created, and the enthusiasm and effort that has been put forth by all members is awesome. Personally I have always been interested in doing a medically related project, so the idea that we chose is a particularly cool one to me. In my spare time I fight crime as Cyclops.</P></DIV><DIV class="member_left"><H4> Jay Stanley </H4><P> I am a third year Biochemistry and Molecular Biology major. I hope to pursue a career in synthetic biology following graduate work. I am attracted to working in the field of synthetic biology because of its inherently clever approach to solving problems. The concept of bio-machinery working together to create something of human design is beautiful. In my spare time I fight crime as Wolverine.</P></DIV><DIV class="member_right"><H4> Chase Davis </H4><P> I'm a biology pre-med student at Hendrix. I've always been fascinated by genetics. IGEM has been a way for me to get a lot closer to one of my interests. It's always been a belief of mine that bioengineering is the most important kind of engineering just due to the sheer possibility of what could be created. In my spare time I fight crime as Gambit.</P></DIV><DIV class="member_left"><H4> Krystal Kim </H4><P> Hi! I'm a Junior BCMB major from Manchester, Tennessee. I learned about IGEM from Dr. Murray's Genetics lab last fall semester. Bioengineering is fascinating to me because of the incredible amount of applications it has, from research to energy to the medical field and more. In my spare time I fight crime as Storm.</P></DIV><DIV class="member_right"><H4> Dr. Richard Murray </H4><P> Dr. Murray is the advisor for the Hendrix College IGEM team. He has a B.Sc. from the University of Western Ontario ('90) and a Ph.D. from the University of Western Ontario ('97), and teaches Cell Biology, Genetics, Developmental Biology, Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience, and a Senior Seminar. His lab was the site of the majority of our project's development, and his help in advising and educating us was invaluable. In his spare time he fights crime as Magneto.</P></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
