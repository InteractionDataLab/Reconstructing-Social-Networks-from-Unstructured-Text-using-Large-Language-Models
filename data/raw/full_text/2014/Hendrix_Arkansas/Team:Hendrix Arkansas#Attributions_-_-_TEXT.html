Project Support and Advice
We would like to thank Dr. Andres A. Caro for pointing us in the right direction with the approach we developed for our cancer detecting machine.
We would like to thank Dr. Andrea A. Duina for the use of some of his resources and utilities from his lab, as well as his time, expertise, and experimental protocols which were all specialized for working with S. cerevisiae.
We would like to thank Dr. Andrew M. Schurko for allowing us the use of bacterial competent cells when our own supply was exhausted.
