Lab Safety
When we set out to begin our project, we borrowed lab space from our project supervisor, Dr. Richard Murray.  His lab space came with its own set of safety protocols, and we were educated on how safety is done in his lab.
Gloves were worn at all times while in the lab.
Hazardous chemicals like Ethidium Bromide were handled with care and discretion.
A fume hood was used for protocols involving hazardous chemicals
Organic Waste beakers were kept and cleaned with chlorine bleach before being put in the lab sink
All glassware was autoclaved for a final cleaning step.
The lab was regularly cleaned with 70% EtOh.
As a team we felt that our safety procedures also assisted us in getting tangible data with which to work.  The inherent sterility of safety protocol increased our ability to carry out our protocols effectively and efficiently.
