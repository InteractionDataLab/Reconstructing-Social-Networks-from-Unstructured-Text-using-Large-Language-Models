Modelling DSF
Clp Over-Expression Hypothesis
Objectives
DSF-Induced Phosphorylation of RpfG Mediates GFP Expression
DSF-Independent Activation of the manA Promoter
Conclusion
Objectives
To investigate why GFP expression was high in the absence of signal in our engineered DSF system.
DSF-Induced Phosphorylation of RpfG Mediates GFP Expression
We constructed models1 similar to those used in the PQS system to help design and calibrate  the signal-response behaviour of the DSF system. Thus we  determined a theoretical, quantitative link between  DSF signal level and GFP expression in the engineered chassis 2,3.  The model took account of the following processes: phosphorylation of RpfG is induced by DSF binding to a cell receptor;  RpfG[P] then degrades c-di-GMP which relieves the inhibition of Clp;  Clp then activated the expression of GFP through the engineered manA promoter. In the absence of a DSF signal, RpfG was predicted to remain in its unphosphorylated form and GFP expression  repressed.
DSF-Independent Activation of the manA Promoter
Interestingly, our experimental results subsequently revealed that in the absence of DSF, the manA promoter was active in our engineered system and hence GFP expression upregulated.
Like the BDSF pathway, the DSF system contains a phosphorelay system.  Our first hypothesis, therefore was that the expression of GFP was dependent on signal-independent phosphorylation of RpfG.
Using the parameter values in Table 1, the model (Fig 1) predicted that increasing the level of phosphorylated RpfG would have no significant effect on the production of GFP in our engineered cells.
Our second hypothesis was that enhanced inhibition of Clp by elevated levels of c-di-GMP could repress GFP expression. However, on setting c-di-GMP levels in the model to a high level, GFP was still expressed (albeit at a lower low level), Fig 2. This can be explained by Clp having a higher binding affinity for the promoter than c-di-GMP.  Since both these reactions are reversible, there will still be sufficient Clp free in the cytoplasm to activate GFP expression.
The model predictions so far still did not explain the high expression levels reported by the wet team. Thus bringing us to our third hypothesis - our cells were over-expressing Clp.
An analysis of our model for the DSF system revealed that the steady state levels of free Clp and c-di-GMP are only dependent on their (constitutive) rate of production and degradation (and not dependent on the Clp - c-di-GMP binding affinities nor the promoter binding affinity).  As shown in Fig 3 we see that the model predict that an over-expression of Clp results in a corresponding high level of GFP production.
Conclusion
Our models were used to test different plausible hypotheses for the DFS-signal independent expression of GFP in our engineered cells. We conclude that over-expression of Clp could be responsible for the experimental observations.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.
