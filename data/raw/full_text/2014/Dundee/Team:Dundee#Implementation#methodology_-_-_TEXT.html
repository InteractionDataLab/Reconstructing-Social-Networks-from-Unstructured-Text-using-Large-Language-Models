Methodology
How We Designed the Technology
User Based Approach
ISO Standards
To build the best device possible we took a professional approach to our design and development processes.
User Based Approach
The L.A.S.S.O. is more than just the development of an idea; we wanted to see whether this device could be realistically implemented in practice. To create a product that had a future in a real-world situation we decided it was vital to talk first to the people who would be using it: the patients and the CF healthcare team  - people  who understand the daily struggles and realities of treating Cystic Fibrosis. So we took a customer based approach by meeting with patients and medical staff to hear their view on how the L.A.S.S.O. should be designed to best meet their needs.
ISO Standards
After obtaining a clear direction for our device from potential users, we spoke to representatives from relevant industries. In particular we contacted a local company that developed medical equipment; the Institute of Medical Science and Technology . We were informed that the main body for devising procedures by which medical devices should be built is the International Organisation of Standards (ISO). As we live in a global community where such standards are important to ensure that “products and services are safe, reliable and of good quality”1 there are strict procedures that must be adhered to. During the development of the L.A.S.S.O. we attempted to apply as many of the points given in the quality management standards 9001 and 13845 as we could. Standard 9001 dictates the procedures for general quality management; giving standards a company should follow when developing a product. Standard 13485 expands on 9001 to specify how a medical device should be developed. We followed these standards in the design and construction2 of the L.A.S.S.O. wherever possible.
Following ISO development criteria compels the completion of a Requirements Document - documentation to show how we were meeting the users needs, the final aims of how the L.A.S.S.O. would operate and the functionality involved. Construction of the first version3 of the Requirements Document was itself an iterative process, updated after feedback from our supervisors, patients and medical staff. This iterative authoring process was again in line with protocol dictated by ISO standards. This first version was audited by an approved Quality Manager for ISO 13845. A second revision 4 was constructed based on  feedback from the audit and again in consultation with the CF community.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Bulletin Board (Policy & Practice)
Come look at the poster explaining how we involved the local and national Cystic Fibrosis community in our project, how we listened to people on the front line of the disease and how they affected our project.
School (Project)
Come in and learn about all the parts that make The Lung Ranger. The lab work that we carried out over the             summer is explained here in detail, along with the modelling and implementation.

Come on in, take a seat and learn how we have interacted with the larger iGEM community. Who the team are, who helped them and how we helped others.
College of Life Sciences
With more than 1100 staff and research students and external funding of around £60 million per year, the College of Life Sciences is one of the largest and most productive research institutes in Europe. This reputation is genuinely global and is reflected in the fact that researchers in our laboratories represent no fewer than 62 different nationalities
Division of Mathematics A small friendly Division which offers a lively and modern programme of study at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.We have research groups in Mathematical Biology, Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing, Magnetohydrodynamics and Applied Analysis.
School of Computing With research areas in Human Centred Computing, Intelligent Systems, Space Technologies and Theory of Computation, the department has an emphasis on development. Furthermore, this department teaches popular undergraduate programs in Applied Computing and Computing Science.
We are a global charitable foundation dedicated to achieving extraordinary improvements in human and animal health. We support the brightest minds in biomedical research and the medical humanities. Our breadth of support includes public engagement, education and the application of research to improve health. We are independent of both political and commercial interests.
BBSRC has a unique and central place in supporting the UK’s world-leading position in bioscience. We are an investor in research and training, with the aim of furthering scientific knowledge, to promote economic growth, wealth and job creation and to improve quality of life in the UK and beyond.
The Biochemical Society exists for the advancement of the molecular and cellular biosciences, both as an academic discipline and to promote its impact on areas of science including biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine.
The Society for General Microbiology is a membership organisation for scientists who work in all areas of microbiology. The Society promotes the understanding of microbiology to a diverse range of stakeholders, including policy-makers, students, teachers, journalists and the wider public, through a comprehensive framework of communication activities and resources.
Established in 2007, Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance (SULSA) is a research pooling partnership between the Universities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews and Strathclyde that is supported by the Scottish Funding Council.
EASTBIO - the BBSRC East of Scotland Bioscience Doctoral Training Partnership - is a partnership between the Universities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and St Andrews; the Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance; and the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance. The DTP scheme will provide students with excellent cross-disciplinary research training in line with the current BBSRC strategy for research support and training.
