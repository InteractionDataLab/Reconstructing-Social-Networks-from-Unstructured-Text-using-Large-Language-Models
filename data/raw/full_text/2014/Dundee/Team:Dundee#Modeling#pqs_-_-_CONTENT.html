We wanted to find a method of increasing the expression of mCherry in our engineered PQS system.  
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><H2 id="1">Sigmoidal Expression of mCherry in PQS System</H2><P>
When our PQS system was induced with synthetic PQS, no mCherry was expressed. We attempted to use mathematical modelling to find out why, and how the situation could be resolved. 

After constructing a series of ordinary differential equations<SUP>1</SUP> we established the following relationship between PQS and mCherry:
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P>
The above equation was then analysed in MAPLE<SUP>2</SUP> for varying PQS concentrations using the parameters in table 1.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P>
Fig 1. shows how the concentration of mCherry increases over time. The general trend is that the rate of expression of mCherry is proportional to PQS signal strength. Most striking is the rapid switch from low expression to high expression as the signal is increased.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P>
When the gradients of mCherry were plotted against PQS concentration (Fig 2), the result was a sigmoidal curve with sharp transition located between signal values of 0.1µM and 1µM.  Below this, expression was effectively zero, and above it, expression was uniformly high. 

These results suggest that the levels of synthetic PQS investigated in our engineered pathway were too low and that the ten fold increases used in the experiments would yield no measurable change in mCherry expression, provided the signal level was below the threshold predicted by the model. To investigate this further we went on to carry out stochastic simulations of the system.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><H2 id="2">Stochastic Simulations Elucidates the “Switch” Behaviour</H2><P>
The lab experiments resulted in no measurable mCherry expression in the PQS system. However, our ODE model predicts that even for very low levels of PQS some mCherry is expressed. These levels could represent below-measurable output, thus are essentially zero. We investigated this further at the “single cell” level.

We constructed a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA)<SUP>7,8</SUP> in order to visualise signal-response at the single cell level. Using the SSA we were able to simulate  mCherry expression of 1000 cells to varying PQS signals over a period of one cell cycle.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P>
At first sight, the stochastic mean in <B>A</B> appeared too low in comparison to the example realisations. However, further analysis revealed that this low mean is caused by many realisations  in which the expression of mCherry was zero (i.e. the promoter never fired).  As shown in Fig 4, in 77% of the realisations for 0.02μM PQS, no mCherry was produced. Increasing the PQS concentration through the previously predicted threshold increased the expression rate  to 90%. For PQS concentrations greater than 2μM, all realisations  produced mCherry in the given time frame. 

What is interesting to note is that once expression started,  mCherry was produced at essentially the same rate, as shown by the parallel trajectories in Fig 3.  We can conclude that a major rate limiting step in the system is the probability of the initiation of mCherry expression. 
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P>  
These stochastic simulations enhanced the deterministic results. The switch behaviour between low and high levels mCherry expression resulted in predicted corresponding molecule numbers shown in Table 2. 
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><H2 id="3">Increasing Promoter Numbers Increases mCherry Expression</H2><P>
We concluded from the SSA that firing of the mCherry promoter was a major rate limiting step, but wanted to provide the wet team with greater understanding of how to increase mCherry production. Subsequently,  after testing several model hypotheses, it was found that increasing the number of promoters had the greatest impact on the expression of mCherry (varying other experimentally controllable parameters were predicted to have essentially no effect on expression level). 
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12">
When the number of promoters in the model was increased by 10-fold (30 to 300) there was a corresponding 10-fold increase in the “high” mCherry expression, as shown in Fig 5. We suggested that increasing the number of promoters would be the only practical method of significantly increasing mCherry expression. However it was subsequently discovered that the number of promoters in our chassis could not be increased significantly as high numbers proved toxic.
</DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><H2 id="4">Conclusions</H2><P>
Our models revealed a distinct switch behaviour in the signal-response curve for mCherry expression.  Using this analysis we put forward the hypothesis that  the synthetic PQS concentrations used in our experiments were not sufficiently high and, although these experiments were conducted using a range of synthetic PQS levels, this range corresponded to fold changes in the low-response region shown in Fig 2.

The predicted switch behaviour has important and positive consequences for the <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Dundee/Implementation/introduction">L.A.S.S.O. </A> - we predict that the mCherry output level would be distinctly bimodal, avoiding the necessity for sensitive calibration of the detecting device - low signals would result in approximately no response, whereas supercritical signals would induce maximal response from the sample.

   Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.  

The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> and <I>Burkholderia cepacia</I>, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. <I>Burkholderia</I> is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium. 

It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state. 

The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by <I>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</I>, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by <I>Burkholderia cepacia</I>. 

By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.
