Introduction
Maths is Fun..and Useful Too!
Aims
In order to help analyze, construct and optimise the biochemical pathways in The Lung Ranger, we used a variety of mathematical tools to create algorithms and simulations. This allowed us to accelerate the development and testing of various project-driven  hypotheses.
Methodology
Mathematical modelling has played a significant role in the development of synthetic biology.  As an investigative tool, modelling  is  capable of abstracting complex systems and reducing them to their core components. Thus a quantitative understanding of the interaction between these core components can be generated, leading to  optimal system design and control.
In our project, we used a variety of mathematical tools with which to design and study our engineered signal transduction pathways.   As illustrated below, each of the approaches, ordinary differential equations (ODEs); stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and NetLogo, provided a different, but complementary understanding of the system.
Each modelling technique allows for the investigation of processes at different levels of observation. ODE allows for prediction as the population level. SSA takes account of low molecule numbers (intrinsic noise) and allows for single cell comparison and a better understanding of sub-population behaviour.  The NetLogo simulation tool affords single, intra-cellular resolution and provides the most visually accessible representation of the biochemistry under study. All codes are available  - just click on the appropriate links in the "References" section at the end of each modelling page.
We applied the same methodology to the study of each of the systems: PQS, BDSF and DSF. Our approach was to first build models for the core components within the engineered system. In this way, we could generate predictions  regarding the expected outcome -   qualitative and quantitative promoter expression behaviour  in response to varying signal input levels.  Having built this theoretical framework, we could then more easily address questions and technical problems generated by the wet science. Most importantly, we were able to use our modelling framework to suggest improvements and solutions to the technical issues that arose and thus steer project design in a positive feedback loop.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.
