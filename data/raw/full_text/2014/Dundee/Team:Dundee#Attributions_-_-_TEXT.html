With a Little Help from Our Friends
We would like to thank all of our instructors and advisors, without whom this project would not have been possible. Professor Tracy Palmer, Dr Fordyce Davidson and Professor Frank Sargent guided the team throughout the duration of the project. Their experience and expertise were crucial to the progression of the project and their support got us through long hours working in the lab. Our advisors; Karim Rafie, François Cléon, Avril Smart and Scott McCrimmon worked closely with the team to help us achieve our goals, providing critical advice and feedback throughout. Dundee iGEM 2013 alumni Chris Earl and Nasir Ahmad provided us with indispensable support and advice on all aspects of the project. Richard Owen and Lucia Licandro gave input on the project based on their iGEM experience.
We would also like to thank all of the members of the Division of Molecular Microbiology, in particular:
Frank Sargent Lab We extend thanks to all of the members of Frank Sargent’s lab. Particularly Professor Frank Sargent and Marilia de Costa. Their advice on the wet team’s work and support with protein work and florescence microscopy was extremely valuable to the team. We would also like to thank them for the equipment and resources supplied by Frank Sargent’s lab.
Tracy Palmer Lab Our project was aided by the valuable support and advice from Tracy Palmer’s lab. In particular, we thank Professor Tracy Palmer and Dr Grant Buchanan for their advice and assistance with molecular biology techniques and Dr James Chalmers for his input on clinical microbiology associated with Cystic Fibrosis.
Robert Ryan Lab We would like to extend thanks to Dr Robert Ryan and his lab members including Dr Shi-qi An and Connor Bowen. Their donations of Burkholderia, Xanthomonas and Pseudomonas gDNA and advice regarding bacterial signalling were invaluable to the success of our project.
We would also like to thank:
Dr Sarah Coulthust: for supplying us with Vibrio fischeri for testing our device.
Dr Jackie Heillbron - MMB manager
Louise Fisher - MMB secretary
Anna Vainikka - MMB technician
Dr Nicola Stanley-Wall - Reader of Molecular Microbiology
We would like to thank Maths PhD students Heather Wallace, Liang Wang and Laoshen Li for their help with the mathematical modelling.
Dr Steven Reynolds
We would like to thank Dr Reynolds for his advice in the design of the electronic circuit.
Dr Mike MacDonald
We would like to thank Dr MacDonald for giving his time to talk to us about how medical devices are constructed in industry. Also for the advise about the use of optics.
Our Experts:

We would like to thank the University of Dundee College of Life Sciences, Eppendorf and New England Biolabs for their donations of equipment and resources.
We would also like to thank BBSRC, the Wellcome Trust, the Biochemical Society and the Society for General Microbiology who funded stipends for 50% of the team, BBSRC EASTBIO Doctoral Training Partnership who funded one stipend and consumable costs and the University of Dundee and the Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund for funding the remainder of the stipends and our attendance at conferences and the Boston Jamboree.
Finally, we would like to thank the iGEM foundation for organising the iGEM competition.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.
