L.A.S.S.O.
Every Good Cowboy Needs One
How the L.A.S.S.O. Fits into The Lung Ranger
Aims
Objectives
How the L.A.S.S.O. Fits into The Lung Ranger
The biological detection systems are potentially capable of detecting the presence of the bacterial species forming the focus of our project. However, it is  unlikely to be capable of generating a quantifiable measure of bacterial load if used in isolation.  Indeed, even a qualitative output from the systems would require it to be used in conjunction with sophisticated laboratory equipment. We therefore created the Light Amplifying Signal Sensing Object (L.A.S.S.O.) -  a device which, when used in conjunction with The Lung Ranger, is potentially capable of quantifying the bacterial load by utilising the biophotonics phenomena. The L.A.S.S.O. would allow for more frequent mobile monitoring of lung infections in CF patients, offering early detection and thus improved treatment, quality of life and ultimately,  increased survival times.
Aims
The main aim was to design a relatively inexpensive device that would be easily used with little training, thus making it a device that both medical staff and patients alike would be comfortable in using. In the future, the device should be capable of being used away from the clinic. To address this aim, the team had to:
show people on the front line in the battle against CF lung disease (medics and patients) how the Dundee iGEM project could be used in practice.
demonstrate the possibility of this having a lasting benefit, not just to provide much quicker diagnosis times, but ultimately giving control back to the patients.
build a bridge between Synthetic Biology and the people it can help by having patients and healthcare professionals be part of the design of the L.A.S.S.O.
Objectives
To build a device able to detect the low light levels produced by our engineered E. coli chassis and quantify this signal with known standards to calculate the amount of bacteria present.
To design a computer application capable of relaying the amount of bacteria present to a downstream user (e.g. Doctor).
To design a computer application which can simulate how the L.A.S.S.O. could be used in practice - showing how information could be easily shared between patient and medical staff (automated, letting the technology do the work).

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.

Bulletin Board (Policy & Practice)
Come look at the poster explaining how we involved the local and national Cystic Fibrosis community in our project, how we listened to people on the front line of the disease and how they affected our project.
School (Project)
Come in and learn about all the parts that make The Lung Ranger. The lab work that we carried out over the             summer is explained here in detail, along with the modelling and implementation.
Library (Log Book)
Read about the experience the team has had over the summer. A week by week description of our work, how we carried out that work and some photos of our time together.
Saloon (iGEM community)
Come on in, take a seat and learn how we have interacted with the larger iGEM community. Who the team are, who helped them and how we helped others.
College of Life Sciences
With more than 1100 staff and research students and external funding of around £60 million per year, the College of Life Sciences is one of the largest and most productive research institutes in Europe. This reputation is genuinely global and is reflected in the fact that researchers in our laboratories represent no fewer than 62 different nationalities
Division of Mathematics A small friendly Division which offers a lively and modern programme of study at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.We have research groups in Mathematical Biology, Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing, Magnetohydrodynamics and Applied Analysis.
School of Computing With research areas in Human Centred Computing, Intelligent Systems, Space Technologies and Theory of Computation, the department has an emphasis on development. Furthermore, this department teaches popular undergraduate programs in Applied Computing and Computing Science.
We are a global charitable foundation dedicated to achieving extraordinary improvements in human and animal health. We support the brightest minds in biomedical research and the medical humanities. Our breadth of support includes public engagement, education and the application of research to improve health. We are independent of both political and commercial interests.
BBSRC has a unique and central place in supporting the UK’s world-leading position in bioscience. We are an investor in research and training, with the aim of furthering scientific knowledge, to promote economic growth, wealth and job creation and to improve quality of life in the UK and beyond.
The Biochemical Society exists for the advancement of the molecular and cellular biosciences, both as an academic discipline and to promote its impact on areas of science including biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine.
The Society for General Microbiology is a membership organisation for scientists who work in all areas of microbiology. The Society promotes the understanding of microbiology to a diverse range of stakeholders, including policy-makers, students, teachers, journalists and the wider public, through a comprehensive framework of communication activities and resources.
Established in 2007, Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance (SULSA) is a research pooling partnership between the Universities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews and Strathclyde that is supported by the Scottish Funding Council.
EASTBIO - the BBSRC East of Scotland Bioscience Doctoral Training Partnership - is a partnership between the Universities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and St Andrews; the Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance; and the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance.
