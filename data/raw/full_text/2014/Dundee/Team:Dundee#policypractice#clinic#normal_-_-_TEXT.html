CF Stories
Informed by the Experts
On this page you will find some of the interviews which we conducted with patients in Ninewells, our local Hospital. These people are our honorary team members, and we are indebted to them all. They were extremely generous with their time and helped to give us an insight into living with Cystic Fibrosis, whilst advising us on many aspects of our project, especially the design of our final product and it's implementation.
We have tried to put the patient's voice at the heart of The Lung Ranger, and we hope that these interviews convey their involvement in the project to you.
