Cis-2 fatty acids are used by many bacterial species as signalling molecules to facilitate inter- and intra-species communication and as a method of regulation of gene expression. <I>Burkholderia</I> Diffusible Signalling Factor (BDSF) is a cis-2-dodecenoic acid that is produced exclusively by the pathogenic bacteria of the <I>Burkholderia cepacia </I>complex where it regulates expression of genes involved in virulence<SUP>1,2</SUP>. It is structurally similar to, but distinct from, DSF (cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid) produced by <I>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</I>.

In <I>B. cenocepacia</I> BDSF activates gene expression through a two component phosphorelay. BCAM0227 is a transmembrane histidine kinase which phosphorylates the response regulator <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1315007">BCAM0228</A> in the presence of exogenous BDSF. BCAM0228 then binds and activates transcription of <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1315008"><I>cblD</I></A>, a gene involved in <I>Burkholderia</I> virulence<SUP>2</SUP>.

We engineered <I>E. coli</I> to express this signal transduction system for the detection of BDSF (as shown in Fig 1), with a promoter-less <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_E0040"><I>gfp</I></A> gene downstream of the <I>cblD</I> promoter. With this, our sensor will detect any BDSF in its environment via the BCAM0227 receptor and activate GFP production.

</P></DIV></DIV><H2 id="1">Building the BDSF Sensor</H2><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P>
Chromosomal DNA from <I>Burkholderia cenocepacia</I> J2315 was kindly gifted to us by Drs Robert Ryan and Shi-Qi An from the Division of Molecular Microbiology in the College of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee. This was used as template for the amplification of BCAM0228 and the <I>cblD</I> promoter region.



The <I>cblD</I> promoter region was cloned into the pSB1C3 plasmid (to give BioBrick <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1315008">BBa_K1315008</A>), and was then subcloned into pBluescript. Promoterless <I>gfp</I> was amplified (using <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K562012">BBa_K562012</A> as a template), and was cloned into pBluescript downstream of the <I>cblD</I> promoter. The <I>manA</I> promoter-<I>gfp</I> construct was then subcloned into pUniprom. A schematic of our completed construct can be seen below (Fig 2). 

A modified version of the BCAM0227 gene which was compatible with BioBrick specifications and standards was synthesised by a third party (Dundee Cell Products). This was subsequently subcloned into the pUniprom vector harbouring P<SUB>cblD</SUB>-<I>gfp</I>. 

To adhere to the iGEM rules and regulations, it was necessary to remove an illegal <I>Eco</I>RI restriction site present in <I>BCAM0228</I>. The modified gene was cloned into the pSB1C3 plasmid (to give BioBrick <A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1315007">BBa_K1315007</A>). <I>BCAM0228</I> was then subcloned into the pUniprom vector that already harboured P<SUB><I>manA</I></SUB>-<I>gfp</I> and <I>BCAM0227</I>. To facilitate immunochemistry, we chose to supply BCAM0227 and BCAM0228 with an influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) tag which can be detected with commercial antibodies. This tag was added to the C-terminus of each protein.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P>

The plasmid was verified by sequencing.

The completed construct was transformed into MC1061 <I>E. coli</I> as a chassis for our biosensor.
</P></DIV></DIV><H2 id="2">Characterisation</H2><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P>
Initially, Western blots were undertaken to test for the sequential production of BCAM0227-HA and BCAM0228-HA.  An overnight culture of the cells were lysed and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE in a 12% acrylamide gel. Anti-HA antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase were used for detection of BCAM0227 and BCAM0228. Fig 3 shows that both of the proteins are being expressed in the system.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P>
With all of the components of the system being produced, we could begin to test for a response to BDSF. To test how the system would respond to BDSF, cells containing the construct were cultured in LB medium and spiked with synthetic BDSF in DMSO at concentrations of 50 ÂµM, which corresponds to the levels found in the sputum of lungs colonised by <I>Burkholderia</I><SUP>3</SUP> and 500 ÂµM. A western blot with anti-GFP antibodies was performed on the treated cells alongside an un-spiked, BDSF-negative control, and MC1061 cells harbouring the empty pUniprom vector. The results are shown in Fig 4.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P>
These results indicate that GFP production is activated regardless of the presence of BDSF. To test whether our <I>E. coli</I> chassis was responsible for activating GFP production, either via phosphorylation of BCAM0228 or by directly activating the <I>cblD</I> promoter, we made a new construct harbouring P<I><SUB>cblD</SUB></I>-<I>gfp</I> and <I>BCAM0228-HA</I>, but lacking <I>BCAM0227</I>. Fig 5 shows that GFP was only produced in the presence of BCAM0228-HA. We therefore concluded that GFP output is likely caused by crosstalk by two component regulatory systems within <I>E. coli</I> promoting the phosphorylated state of the BCAM0228 response regulator.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-xs-12"><P>
We are continuing to investigate this issue by screening <I>E. coli</I> mutants carrying deletions in genes coding for sensor kinases, taking advantage of the <I>E. coli</I> Keio mutant collection<SUP>3</SUP>. Alternatively it may be that BCAM0228 is being phosphorylated by a small molecular weight phosphate donor such acetylphosphate. Acetylphosphate production can be eliminated in a <I>pta-ackA</I> double deletion mutant. Further work is required before the BDSF sensor is fully functional.

   Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patientâs life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.  

The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I>, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> and <I>Burkholderia cepacia</I>, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. <I>Burkholderia</I> is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium. 

It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state. 

The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by <I>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</I>, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by <I>Burkholderia cepacia</I>. 

By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.
