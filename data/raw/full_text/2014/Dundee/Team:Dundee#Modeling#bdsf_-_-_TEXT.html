Modelling BDSF
Prediction of Cross-Talking Kinase
Objectives
BDSF-Induced Phosphorylation of BCAM0228[P] Mediates GFP Expression
BCAM0228 is Phosphorylated by Unknown Compound
Conclusion
Objectives
To investigate why GFP expression was high in the absence of signal in our engineered BDSF system.
BDSF-Induced Phosphorylation of BCAM0228[P] Mediates GFP Expression
We constructed models1 similar to those used in the PQS system to investigate the signal-response behaviour of the BDSF system. Using the parameters defined in table 1, our results2,3 verified what we had expected to happen. Phosphorylation of BCAM0228 is induced by BDSF binding to a cell receptor.   BCAM0228[P] then activated the expression of GFP through the engineered cbld promoter. In the absence of a BDSF signal, BCAM0228 remained in its unphosphorylated form and GFP expression was repressed.  Increasing the signal induced an increased GFP response (Fig 1).
BCAM0228 is Phosphorylated by Unknown Compound
Our experimental results revealed that in the absence of BDSF, the cblD promoter was active in our engineered system and hence GFP expression upregulated.
From our system of equations we know that the expression of GFP is dependant on the levels of BCAM0228[P]. We hypothesised that one possible mechanism by which our cell could be expressing GFP in the absence of signal was by the presence of BCAM0228[P] independent of BDSF-binding mediated phosphorylation. This suggests that an unknown compound could be phosphorylating BCAM0228 in our engineered cells.
Comparing Fig 2 to Fig 1, it is clear that the model predicts that the expression of GFP is higher when BCAM0228 is being constitutively phosphorylated than in the “normal” case. Moreover, we are also able to conclude that the model predicts that the presence of BDSF has very little effect on the overall expression of GFP when the constitutive phosphorylation process is operating.
Conclusions
Our models predict that an as yet unknown agent phosphorylates BCAM0228 in the absence of a BDSF signal and that in fact the level of the BDSF signal has little quantifiable effect on GFP expression in our engineered cells.

Abstract
Navigation Instructions
Sponsors
Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that results in the accumulation of thick mucus in the epithelial linings of the entire body, particularly the respiratory tract. Over the course of a patient’s life, the mucus-lined lung epithelium becomes repeatedly infected with pathogenic bacteria that stimulate an immune response; leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and ultimately, respiratory failure.
The microflora of the Cystic Fibrosis lung changes over time. In childhood, the major coloniser is Staphylococcus aureus, but as the patient matures other bacterial pathogens infect. The later-dominating pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, are very difficult to eradicate and are associated with chronic decline in lung function. Burkholderia is so infectious that patients have to be isolated from one another, and can be denied lung transplants due to the persistence of this bacterium.
It is important, therefore, for medics to monitor and identify the levels of bacteria within the respiratory tract of a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Currently, patients must provide sputum samples and identification of bacteria takes between 72 hours and 2 weeks, by which point the bacteria can be in an antibiotic resistant state.
The Dundee 2014 iGEM project is focused on designing and testing a device that will rapidly and non-invasively identify the bacteria colonising a Cystic Fibrosis patient. Three biosensors will be developed that recognise external signal molecules produced by key bacteria, all of which are known to be in sputum samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients. A quinolone signal (PQS) is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Diffusible Signal Factor (DSF) is produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism that is also associated with Cystic Fibrosis lung infection in adults, and BDSF is a related, but chemically distinct molecule that is produced by Burkholderia cepacia.
By engineering signal recognition and signal transduction proteins from these biological systems the Dundee iGEM team want to produce a portable electronic device that will identify infection outside of the clinic, so that patients do not have to travel great distances, and can be used to help health professionals make informed and rapid decisions on antibiotic treatments.
