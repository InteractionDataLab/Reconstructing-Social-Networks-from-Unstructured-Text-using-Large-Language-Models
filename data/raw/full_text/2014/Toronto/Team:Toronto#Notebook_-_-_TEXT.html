Week 1
picked single MG1655 and pTRC99A strains into liquid culture,     incubated overnight (pTRC99A in LB+Amp)
miniprepped pTRC, O/N culture of MG1655
MG1655 did not grow on antibiotic plates, so stocks are good!
prepped DNA for transformation – pCas9 and RFP reporter
made MG1655 electrocompetent –      electroporate and plated transformants, incubated overnight
Week 2
transformation of RFP, pCas9, GFP, fmt into NEB5alpha
transformants plated and incubated overnight
then inoculated into liquid culture, incubated overnight
overnight culture of MG1655 and pTRC99A
Miniprepped RFP and pTRC99A
tested restriction enzymes EcoRI, Xbal, SpeI, Pstl        on miniprep and ran on gel w/ uncut as control
cut plasmids were too faint to see – need more        concentrated DNA in preps!
O/N cultures of RFP, pCas9, GFP from transformation
miniprep of O/N cultures of transformants and pTRC99A
Week 3
miniprep again, greater volume (3mL)      for RFP, GFP, Cas9, pTRC99A + nanodrop
digest product (w SpeI, EcoRI, cutsmart) and run on gel
O/N culture from plate of extra biobrick, RFP, MG1655
start RFP and MG1655 liquid cultures for the RFP      spectrum measurements in the afternoon
RFP grew slowly and was transformed into NEB5alpha instead of MG1655
digest 8 samples from yesterday’s miniprep of 8 biobrick cultures,     load and run gel of digest
oligos and gblocks arrived
did PCR of pCas9 and pTRC99A chunks
Started MG1655 liquid culture for making chemically competent
make chemically competent cells, transform RFP into them,        PCR purification, run on gel
Week 4
miniprepped pCas9 + pTRC99A (w 7mL of cells)
did gel extraction – cut out pCas9 + pTRC digests –      PCR both as well as nanodrop
Mon/Tues = PCR w mastermix,      Wed = make comp MG1655 and heatshock RFP,      Thurs/Fri = confirm RFP and Marafini protocol/golden-gate assembly
PCR from the Friday before did not work
so do lots of minipreps from 10mL cultures and start over, use larger volumes for digests
DNA eluted into collection tube but saw salt contamination when nanodropped therefore redo miniprep…
miniprepped pTRC and pCas9 and then nanodropped –        results were good so created gel for next day, as well as a digestion
digested/ran the gel/extracted, will nanodrop gel extraction – if worked, try PCR again
Week 5
Wed. minipreps were good (however possibly from just high free nucleotides), gel extraction failed (no DNA at the end and a lot of salt contamination) – so just PCR from miniprepped plasmids
digest and run gel of digest at the same time!
PCR of pTRC and pCas9 – have also been digested
ran gel! 5 part sample, 1 part loading dye
if PCR worked, digest PCR product w DpnI – got nothing for pCas9 though on the gel (to be re-PCR-ed), but bright bands for pTRC
competent MG1655 also done
PCR of miniprep C1 #1 of cas9… did 10 x 10uL reaction using gradient temps in 58-68 range
run on gel to see if PCR worked
PCR gel showed 2 weak bands – either not enough DNA or PCR failed
heat shock transformation for MG1655 w RFP      plasmid but very few colonies on CM plate
Week 6
PCR product (???) run on gel, pick most successful PCR
DpnI digest following protocol in NEB Gibson manual     Transform RFP & MG1655, O/N cultures
pCas9PCR product visible on gel
DpnI digest + PCR cleanup of digest (ended up not having enough DNA)
plating of transformed RFP into DH5a
processed PCR – ran on gel, DpnI digest also ran on gel, PCR cleanup, nanodrop (worked well)
needed to transform pCas9+spacer plasmid & RFP DH5a
Week 7/8
transform RFP & BL21(DE3)
PCR of pCas9, pTRC99A
Gibson – pick 8 colonies, make O/N colonies, try to PCR form reaction to get 4-fragment superchunk
Maraffini – use Anderson high for 4 fragment      (phosphorylation + annealing of spacers if we get a lot of DNA), otherwise using Aug 18 miniprep do a BsaI digest
got colonies from Gibson
3 things in parallel:
miniprepped plasmids from Gibson transformants from O/N liquid cultures (need to be sent for sequencing)       , plasmids digested w E+P and to be run on gel
making competent MG1655 – transform RFP into it
tried BsaI digestion and gel extraction on Stanford-brown pCas9 (for Marafini/Golden-gate),        does not seem to work even w large volumes
look at plates from transformation, run E+P digests on gel – if the digests look wrong size, do colony PCR on rest of Gibson colonies on plates
use fwd/rev primers for cas9 and p!TRC chunks
if correct, also PCR the 3-fragment superchunk from the miniprep plasmid by using Cas9 fwd with p!TRC rev primers
try a gel-extraction protocol…
Week 9
Main thing – GIBSON ASSEMBLY
screened 8 colonies – miniprepped, EcoRI + PstI digest & wrong product, non-specific assembly
extend gblocks (Anderson high + tracr) so more overlap, try Gibson again
did digests of plasmids w one restriction enzyme instead of double digest + run gel (for less confusing results) – used miniprep #1-4
made O/N cultures from first Gibson reaction #9-15 – miniprepped and streak out plates
minipreps #5-8 from earlier digested w EcoRI and PstO (separately), run on gel
take 2 minipreps, do 3 reactions on each – EcoRI only, PstI only, both EcoRI + PstI
Week 10
miniprep out RFP plasmid to be used for putting biobricks into pSB1C3, will want to screen for non-red colonies at the end of the process
unable to do digest because nanoprep of all 3 minipreps was too low
primers arrived – ran PCR  w new primers
also digested RPF
run digests on gel (1/2 thickness)
ran the original gblocks w extended gblocks –      not enough of original gblocks to show up on gel
combined PCR reactions of tracr gblocks into one,      same with Anderson High PCR products
purified both
PCR purified Cas9 array from a PCR in August
purified p!TRC chunk found
all 4 to be used for Gibson assembly!
glycerol stocked 3 tubes of colonies from first      Gibson attempt (#3, 4, 7)
transformed Gibson in NEB5alpha, ½ of each reaction      tube into a total of 4 NEB5alpha – 4 tubes plated      onto 2 plates each = total 8 plates incubated
on Friday, found colonies from the Gibson assembly and      did colony PCR
colony PCR primers were designed to cover the seams      where the 4 chunks joined
mixed the template DNA and biobrick primers for the      Cas9-array chunk, but did not add the master mix yet      (done later)
Week 11
ran Gibson colony PCR on gel – colonies #3 + 6 have correct bands, started O/N cultures of them w cell suspensions from colony PCR
miniprep and glycerol stock them (low copy plasmid – do 3uL miniprep)
PCR of cas9 chunk – run on gel, see if band is at 4595
using RFP miniprep from earlier, digest w EcoRI and PstI
linearised plasmid digested same way (if DNA dissolved – was left sitting overnight to dissolve)
nothing on gel at correct size…. only used 1uL of DNA for gel though
digest ~1000ng of Gibson miniprep from 2 colonies w EcoRI and PstI, run on gel
run 5uL of tube labelled C6*
cas9-array chunk biobrick extension PCR barely worked – not enough DNA after PCR purification     but tracr chunk biobrick PCR worked
digested/ligated into pSB1C3, transformed into competent cells
Gibson colonly #3 didn’t assemble correctly, only produced 1 band from E+P digestion
transformed ligation into NEB5alpha – after 2 hour (actual = 10 min) incubation in SOB, pipetted into 2mL LB Cm and grew overnight
miniprepped to see if it grew and packed it up for shipping!
