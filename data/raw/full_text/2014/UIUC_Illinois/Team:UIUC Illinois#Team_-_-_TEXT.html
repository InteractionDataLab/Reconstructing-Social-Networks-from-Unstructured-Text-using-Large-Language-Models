Advisor:
Todd Freestone
I'm a graduate student in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and do metabolic engineering research in the lab of Huimin Zhao.
Michelle Goettge
I am a graduate student in the Department of Microbiology, UIUC. My research focuses on the discovery of phosphonate natural products produced by various Streptomyces species and the characterization of phosphonate biosynthetic pathways.
Ahmet Badur
Ahmet Badur received his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  He is pursuing a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering under the advisement of Dr. Chris V. Rao.  He is currently investigating carbohydrate degrading enzymes from marine bacteria.
Kori Dunn
Kori Dunn received her BS in Chemical Engineering from Cornell University. She is currently pursuing a PhD in the laboratory of Dr. Christopher V. Rao. Her research focuses on the engineering of Zymomonas mobilis for the production of biofuels and other value-added products.
Xiong Xiong
My name is Xiong Xiong, a graduate student from Prof. Huimin Zhao's group in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at UIUC. My specialties include genome engineering, metabolic engineering and automation.
Team Member:
Sameer Andani
My name is Sameer Andani and I'm a third year Molecular & Cellular Biology/ Psychology Major. I'm intimately fascinated with synthetic biology and the advent of the genomic age. I'm morbidly curious about the elimination of cell senescence as well as manipulating & taking advantage of the human microflora. 2014 is a provocative & beautiful year to be alive, being a part of Illinois's iGEM team has been an absolute pleasure.
Nick Cornell
A sophomore in bioengineering, Nicholas Cornell harbors a great appreciation for the field of genetic engineering and its potential applications. Born and raised in the Chicago suburb of Lombard, Nick looks forward to a career in the biomedical industry. Often in the lab at the crack of dawn, this Illinois iGEMer enjoys basketball, bacterial transformations and marathon primer design sessions.
Noah Flynn
Hey! I am Noah Flynn from the Biological Engineering Department. Over the summer I mainly worked on our software projects, website design and development, and bioreactor modeling. I think this quote by Woody Williams concisely summarizes the experience “No matter how good the team or how efficient the methodology, if we’re not solving the right problem, the project fails.”
Dipen Kumar
My name is Dipen Kumar. I am a sophomore at UIUC and my major is Bioengineering. I helped this project by coming in the lab and I learned a lot because of iGEM. I am a big fan of taking naps and eating Chipotle!
Hans Lau
Hans Lau is a junior majoring in biological engineering. He worked in the Wetlab running PCR reactions, gels, digestion, and purification. He also worked in developing a model to show caffeine degradation as well as planning a bioreactor to test the result of caffeine degradation. Quote(to Noah): You want me to go pink samus on you?
Arudhir Singh
My name is Arudhir (Aru) Singh, I am a junior in Engineering Physics with a minor in running PCRs. I helped develop Cutsultant and perform assorted experiments in the wetlab. iGEM has provided me invaluable experience and knowledge in the field of synthetic biology
Gege Wang
Hi! I’m Gege Wang, a Junior in Agricultural and Biological Engineering. My experience with iGEM is both exciting and valuable. During the summer, I worked as a researcher, graphic designer, as well as a photographer.
Xiaodan Wang
Hi, my name is Xiaodan Wang and I am a junior in Agricultural and Biological Engineering. I am the project manager for golden gate and dedicated to doing the experiments and keeping the inventories. My career goal is to be a biomedical engineer and doctor.
SeokChan Yoo
Hello, my name is SeokChan Yoo from Agricultural Biological Engineering Department. I born at 1992 in South Korea, and came to United States when I was 16 years old. In this year, I learned a lot from each members of iGEM and I tried to contribute myself as wet lab member and software member
