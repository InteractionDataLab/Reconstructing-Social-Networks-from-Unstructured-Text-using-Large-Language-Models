OFFICIAL PROFILE
The dark side of chocolate is a well-known issue for small animals. To resolve this, UIUC iGEM 2014 Team focused on creating a probiotic which breaks down harmful Theobromine into innocuous substrate. Additionally, we worked on creating a novel way to deal with coffee waste, converting it into more viable feed source.
UIUC Software Team attempted to make two programs. Cutsultant helps synthetic biologists to find the best enzyme for selected cut sites. EvoTracer is designed to give information about the tolerance of plasmid against mutation, recombination, and other factors that react to disrupt the original genome.
