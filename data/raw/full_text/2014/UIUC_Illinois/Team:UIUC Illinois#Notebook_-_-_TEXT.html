Followed bacterial transformation protocol to prepare/grow culture overnight
Inoculated 5 mL of M9 with CBB1 and placed it in 30 degree celsius shaker for 3 days
Previous CBB1 culture did not grow, showed slight growth
pDCAF3 strain in M9 did grow in the 30 degree celsius shaker
Monday 16th June
ASDF
No growth in M9 by CBB1
To grow the promoter plasmid:
5 mL of LB + 1 uL Amp
Label tubes
Grow in 30 degree celsius shaker overnight
New CBB1 trials:
2 tubes of 1 mL M9 + 2 tubes of 1 mL LB each with 10 uL of sample
Purify genomic DNA plasmid following the Wizard Protocol
Added lysis buffer before centrifuging. So we separated (translate) sample into 2 tubes and will (translate) accordingly
We put our 2 promoter plasmid plates in the 4 degree celsius shelf
Tuesday 17th June

Purified both promoter plasmids using the purification protocol
Stored in the -20 degree celsius freezer in the DNA box
Thursday 19th June
ASDF
Quantified promoter plasmid (J23114 #1 and #2)
#1: 342.9 ng/ul with a ratio of 1.9     #2: 373.2 ng/ul with a ratio of 1.91
Checking to see if expired enzymes work: Using the J23114 promoter plasmid, we will see if the 3-year expired SpeI works
We combined 1 uL of 2.1 buffer, 1 uL of Spe1, and 6 uL of J23114 promoter
Heat bath at 37 degrees celsius for 1 hour because 2.1 buffer is <100% effective on this enzyme
Then we will run gel electrophoresis: Concluded that the enzyme works
