OFFICIAL PROFILE
Outreach
MCB New Student Welcome
For Outreach, our team attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's Molecular and Cellular Biology Student Welcome. At this event MCB students were able to mingle with other MCB students, learn about MCB specific student organizations, learn how to be successful at biology and University of Illinois. There our group set up a booth about iGEM and informed incoming students about genetic engineering and about iGEM. We tried to spread the word about iGEM in the hopes of gaining more interest and potentially building a stronger team for next year.
IEEE Hackathon
Our team participated in this year's hackathon. Throughout the course of the night, we were able to gain input on editing and making our software functional. We were able to communicate with students about bioinformatic related approached to soliving problems as well as having conversations about modeling and genetic cascades. The night proved to be prolific for the progress of Cutsultant!
Unlike when our team members perform phase contrast microscopy at 100x, resolution in images is not our strongest suit!
