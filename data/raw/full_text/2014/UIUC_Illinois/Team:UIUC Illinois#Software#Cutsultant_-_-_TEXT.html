OFFICIAL PROFILE
Having trouble with finding the best enzymes for your cut sites?
Here is our Cutsultant software that will potentially suggest to you the optimal enzyme!
Description:
Currently there are few websites that give you only cut sites, however we heard that many synthetic biologists struggle with obtaining optimized enzymes Cutsultant is a python script created to expedite the process of finding restriction enzymes that produce the most optimal digestions. Using Biopython's restriction enzyme package, as well as user-inputted sequences and available restriction enzymes Cutsultant can use one or two sequences (typically a plasmid and/or a plasmid with an insert) and generate lists of enzymes that produce an optimal cut based on a a few parameters, such as number of cuts, minimum band length, maximum band length, and differentiability of bands.
