I'm intimately fascinated with synthetic biology and the advent of the genomic age. I'm morbidly curious about the elimination of cell senescence as well as manipulating &amp; taking advantage of the human microflora. 2014 is a provocative &amp; beautiful year to be alive, being a part of Illinois's iGEM team has been an absolute pleasure.</P><B>Nick Cornell</B><P>A sophomore in bioengineering, Nicholas Cornell harbors a great appreciation for the field of genetic engineering and its potential applications. Born and raised in the Chicago suburb of Lombard, Nick looks forward to a career in the biomedical industry. Often in the lab at the crack of dawn, this Illinois iGEMer enjoys basketball, bacterial transformations and marathon primer design sessions.</P><B>Noah Flynn</B><P>Hey! I am Noah Flynn from the Biological Engineering Department. Over the summer I mainly worked on our software projects, website design and development, and bioreactor modeling. I think this quote by Woody Williams concisely summarizes the experience “No matter how good the team or how efficient the methodology, if we’re not solving the right problem, the project fails.”</P><B>Dipen Kumar</B><P>My name is Dipen Kumar. I am a sophomore at UIUC and my major is Bioengineering. I helped this project by coming in the lab and I learned a lot because of iGEM. I am a big fan of taking naps and eating Chipotle!</P></DIV><DIV class="rightparagraph"><B>Hans Lau</B><P>Hans Lau is a junior majoring in biological engineering. He worked in the Wetlab running PCR reactions, gels, digestion, and purification. He also worked in developing a model to show caffeine degradation as well as planning a bioreactor to test the result of caffeine degradation. Quote(to Noah): You want me to go pink samus on you?</P><B>Arudhir Singh</B><P>My name is Arudhir (Aru) Singh, I am a junior in Engineering Physics with a minor in running PCRs. I helped develop Cutsultant and perform assorted experiments in the wetlab. iGEM has provided me invaluable experience and knowledge in the field of synthetic biology</P><B>Gege Wang</B><P>Hi! I’m Gege Wang, a Junior in Agricultural and Biological Engineering. My experience with iGEM is both exciting and valuable. During the summer, I worked as a researcher, graphic designer, as well as a photographer. </P><B>Xiaodan Wang</B><P>Hi, my name is Xiaodan Wang and I am a junior in Agricultural and Biological Engineering. I am the project manager for golden gate and dedicated to doing the experiments and keeping the inventories. My career goal is to be a biomedical engineer and doctor.</P><B>SeokChan Yoo</B><P>Hello, my name is SeokChan Yoo from Agricultural Biological Engineering Department. I born at 1992 in South Korea, and came to United States when I was 16 years old. In this year, I learned a lot from each members of iGEM and I tried to contribute myself as wet lab member and software member</P></DIV><CENTER><H2> UIUC 2014 Team Photo </H2></CENTER><DIV class="footer"><DIV class="footbox" style=""><B>The Institute for Genomic Biology</B>
