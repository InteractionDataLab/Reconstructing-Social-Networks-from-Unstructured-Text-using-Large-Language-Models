The impact of food quality assurance has come increasingly into the forefront of public opinion. Concerns about the quality of marketed olive oil in the US have become increasingly resonant [1]. Health benefits that would be of interest to consumers are linked to extra virgin olive oil [2]. Since most of the olive oil marketed as virgin or extra virgin olive oil is not of that quality, there is the potential for significant consumer interest if this information moved into the public arena.
According to a CDFA report, standards “ease consumer apprehensiveness toward olive oil products and help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions” [3]. As members of iGEM, we believe that educating the public through technology is an important investment. Our device has the potential to behave like a standard, in that it may inform consumers about the characteristics of the oil they are purchasing, and give them confidence in their choice. The affirmation of product quality has been shown to be an important deciding factor in consumer decision-making and perceptions. As two Greek studies of consumer behavior by Duquenne and Vlontzos found, Greek households recognized certification as a guaranty of quality [4]. This recognition of certified quality translated into a significantly increased willingness to pay (WTP) for higher quality oil authenticated by olive oil seals. Furthermore, in their study more than 56% of Greek consumers were disposed to pay a price at least 10% higher for certified high quality olive oil and 22.5% were willing to pay more than 20% more for a superior product.
As mentioned before, rancidity is most likely to affect imported olive oil products since transport and storage times are key factors leading to rancidity.  It is, of course, possible that any olive oil producer or processor could willfully adulterate olive oil with rancid olive oil or even canola oil. Producers who adulterate their olive oil, or who sell old and rancid stock do so to save money, because filling larger quotas with lower quality product is more product than filling small quotas with higher quality product. Notwithstanding, since California olive oil producers serving the domestic market will not face the significant international transport challenge they will be more likely to produce a high quality product into the market. Assuming that the biosensor technology will be able to detect rancidity in imported olive oil products, it is likely that the domestic producers will be able to differentiate their product on quality and thus gain market penetration.
In practice, we envision the biosensor being integrated into multiple commercial stages. The device could test olive juice before official pressing to ensure that the olive fruits were not already fermented due to poor handling. This could also occur during on-the-spot checks in the bottling process, and during periodical evaluations of distributor stock to identify potentially rancid inventory. Retailers could select random bottles from their shelves, test the oil for rancidity on the biosensor, and thus maintain high quality stock for customers.
In summary, if a low cost biosensor for detecting rancidity (aldehydes) in olive oil was readily available it is reasonable to assume that producers and retailers could use the device to classify their oil as rancid or not, and to thus clear the market of defective product. If that happens, the biosensor that we have developed could enhance the CFDA’s ability to not only maintain a quality standard but augment the strength of a state quality seal. It therefore follows that our biosensor device would in part influence consumer purchasing patterns and ultimately the trade of olive oil.
