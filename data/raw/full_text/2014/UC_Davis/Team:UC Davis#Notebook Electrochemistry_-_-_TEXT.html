Week 1
6/16
Settled on paper: An improved biosensor for acetaldehyde detection using a bienzymic strategy at poly(neutral red) modified carbon film electrodes by Ghica et Al.
Emailed professors at UCD as well as paper authors for advice/consulting regarding electrochemical cell production. Dr. Land for his experience with surface chemistry, Dr. Revzin for his experience with biomaterials and biosensors, Dr. Stroeve for his experience in colloids, surfaces, and biosensors, Dr. Berben for her experience with electrochemistry, and Dr. Brett, Dr. Pauliukaite, and Dr. Ghica (PI’s involved in the paper mentioned previously) for their work in constructing electrochemical cells.
6/18
Wrote up protocol for production from carbon film electrode synthesis to implementation of biosensor in a device. Based on paper mentioned above (An improved biosens…) as well as several papers by the same authors describing synthesis methods for the carbon electrodes. Carbon film electrode papers: Carbon Film Resistors as Electrodes: Voltammetric Properties and Applications in Electrolysis, Characterization of Carbon Film Electrodes for Electroanalysis by Electrochemical Impedance.
Confirmed meetings with several professors (Land, Revzin, Berben)
Met with Dr. Wang, Olive Oil Expert. She provided several aldehyde samples as well as discussed olive oil progress.
Wrote back to paper authors, looking to get in touch with Dr. Leiss at the department of physics at the university of Munich. He provided Ghica et Al. with the carbon film electrodes necessary for biosensor construciton.
Underwent general lab safety training with Diane Hoffman (2 hrs)
6/19
Met with Dr. Berben, electrochemistry expert.
There is a characteristic base capacitative current associated with the particular electrode
Good source for electrodes: CH Instruments
Pt counter electrode is a good choice; ensure large enough size. SCE or AgCl electrode would work interchangeably. AgCl is much cheaper, and doesn’t pose a safety hazard.
Ionic liquids are a good choice for solvent - conducting, solubilizing both non-polar olive oil, as well as polar Phosphate buffer solution. However, they may be expensive, or difficult to obtain. THF or Hexane may be different options to consider, though they may have an impact on protein activity.
Interference from other species in the olive oil should not be an issue as the redox potential of most organic compounds in the oil will be far above the working potential of the electrode. In any case, run standards to account for possible interference.
Met with Dr. Revzin, biomaterials expert.
Has professional potentiostat that may be of use when we construct electrode
Willing to help with the troubleshooting process.
Protocol looks good. Only testing will tell if it works.
Underwent further safety training
Brainstormed for general presentation.
6/20
Made rough parts list spreadsheet for electrochemical device
Made rough pitch presentation.
Group meeting, presented week’s work and findings
Met with Dr. Land, Surface Chemistry Expert
XPS for surface bond characterization
Electron microscopy best bet for estimate of surface rougness and landscape
Could do Auger Electron Spectroscopy (Native to some EM’s) to determine surface coverage of polymer films etc…
