2014 UC Davis iGEM Team
Lucas Murray
Hi, I am a fourth year biomedical engineering major with an emphasis in systems and synthetic biology. When I'm not going back and forth between labs, I enjoy competitive sailing, freediving, and underwater photography. If I had free time, you'd find me doing any of those three. My main background is in instrumentation and chemistry, but my academic focus is on synthetic biology, biophysics, and molecular biology. I plan to apply to graduate school this fall, where I would like to continue to study synthetic biology.
Sarah Ritz
Hello, my name is Sarah Ritz. I enjoy playing the piano, swimming, camping, and baking. I am currently a 5th year biochemistry major with an interest in pursuing a career in the medical field. I am looking forward to graduating and gaining work experience conducting clinical research and patient care.
Simon Staley
Hi! My name is Simon Staley. I am currently a third year biosystems engineer at UC Davis. I am interested in pursuing agricultural and food processing engineering when I graduate from Davis next year. This interest has primarily risen from my family's agricultural background as well as South African roots. When I'm not in lab, I enjoy learning obscure historical and geographical facts and swimming laps at the pool.
E. Aaron Cohen
I'm a transfer student from the high desert of California. I received my AS in mathematics at Copper Mountain College where I also worked in a science lab. I'm now a 4th year biomedical engineering major with hopes of one-day owning my own biotechnology business.
Julie Yeonju Song
I am a second year majoring in Biomedical Engineering. My current lab interests are biochemistry, protein and neuroengineering. Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing piano, composing music, reading, and hiking.
James Lucas
Conqueror of the outdoors, purveyor of the fine arts, and milkshake connoisseur.
I am a fourth year Biochemistry major with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. I plan on pursuing a PhD in Bioengineering with an emphasis in synthetic and systems biology after I graduate from UC Davis.
Brian Tamsut
I am a third year biochemistry major. Before iGEM I worked in several plant genetics laboratories focused on creating transgenic species. When I'm not in the lab I enjoy hiking biking and competitive bowling.
