Made Parts List
Organized based on Protocols for three different methods of surface treatment/mediator fixation and two different sources for screen printed carbon Electrodes
Pine Instruments based in Pennsylvania and Dropsens based in Spain both make carbon electrodes and associated devices for their use. Assembled necessary parts to go through with the project from each manufacturer.
Surface Treatment Methods: Poly(Neutral Red), poly(Meldola’s Blue), and covalently linked Azure A all act as mediators for the oxidation of NADH at the screen printed carbon electrode. Chemicals for each protocol added to parts list.
Met with Dr. Selena Wang, Olive Oil Expert
Discussed Olive Oil regulatory meeting on July 15th
Compound list update
Differences and varying health benefits of rancid vs. Fresh oil: Antioxidants gone from rancid, but monounsaturated fats not all together lost
Discussed the possibility of putting on two fundraisers / awareness events. The first would be a farmer’s market booth to raise awareness. The second would be a private fundraiser to which olive oil industry reps would be invited, members of the UCD faculty / administration, plus other industry reps. big $$.
Researcher Dropsens and Pine Instruments, two different screen printed electrode manufacturers, contacted representatives for each with with inquiries and sponsorship possibilities.
