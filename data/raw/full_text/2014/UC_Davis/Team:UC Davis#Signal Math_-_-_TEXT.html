Testing Our Model
Olive Oil
Olive Oil
To model our system, we first focused our attention on the linear range of our enzyme's Michaelis Menten plot. The linear range of this plot is governed by the above relationship. This was useful for describing single aldehydes, but olive oil contains many aldehydes and the enzymatic response is different for each one.
To describe this mathematically we started with the assumption that none of the substrates would induce competitive inhibition. If this was the case, the modeling would be simple. We would consider the observed velocity to be a linear combination of the three singular responses to aldehyde.
Now our model has three unknown concentrations, but only one equation: this is why we need three enzymes. Now we consider the entire model:
