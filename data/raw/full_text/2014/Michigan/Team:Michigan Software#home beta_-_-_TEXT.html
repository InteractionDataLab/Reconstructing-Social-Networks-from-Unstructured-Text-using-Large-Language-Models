Official Team Profile
Choosing apt and reliable protocols for new experiments is a problem that productive wet labs routinely face. Experimental practices may differ immensely across laboratories, including the amount of time spent on each step, the use of specific brands of reagent, or conditions under which an experiment was performed. As such, current online protocols are often vague and inefficient, and diminish the reproducibility of experiments.

To improve protocol efficiency and reproducibility, we developed a free online catalog of laboratory protocols: Protocat. With a built-in rating, favoriting, and commenting system, Protocat condenses the vast array of laboratory protocols into one easy-to-browse location, increasing protocol reproducibility for labs across the globe.
