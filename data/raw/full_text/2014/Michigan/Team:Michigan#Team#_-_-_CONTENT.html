Anne Gu, a Freshman in Mechanical Engineering, is ridiculously busy and stressed out because she is an engineer. Anne spent this year learning the ropes of cloning and gaining valuable experience to help the team moving forward. Her other interests emerged when she designed a highly suggestive team T-shirt. She had probably forgotten to wear her glasses that day.
Spirit Animal: Teacup Piglet</P></DIV><DIV><P style="width:400px;position:absolute;top:7545px;left:300px;width=400px"> Our adopted member from our friends at Eastern Michigan University, Malcolm would travel from MILES away to participate and help the team. (Ok, only 10 miles) From making agarose gels to posing like a “diva” for our team photos, Malcolm kept everyone entertained.  Suffering through the torture of orgo I and II this Summer, Malcolm reminded everyone else just how happy we are to be done with Orgo!

Always the practical jokester, Ravi never misses an opportunity to give a “if I were an enzyme, I’d be DNA helicase...” joke. Between studying neuroscience and reading Russian literature, Ravi still found time throughout the summer to do some old-fashioned cloning. While transforming cells, the topics of good vs. evil, religion, and crime and punishment never fail to arise when discussing with this eccentric scholar. Just be careful who you tell that, “will a little more alcohol catalyze this reaction, baby?” joke to Ravi.
