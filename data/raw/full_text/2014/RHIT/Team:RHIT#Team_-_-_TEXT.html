Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology is located in Terre Haute, Indiana. Rose-Hulman has participated in the iGEM competition for the past three years, and recently built a new state of the art synthetic biology lab. With this new lab, Rose-Hulman plans to further develop its synthetic biology program, as well as continuing to participate in the iGEM competition for years to come.
This year's team consists of seven team members along with two advisers. Three of the team members are pursuing Biology degrees and three are pursuing Biomedical Engineering degrees, while one member is majoring in Art. We believe that a balance of engineering and science brought great utility to our team and can be seen throughout our project.
