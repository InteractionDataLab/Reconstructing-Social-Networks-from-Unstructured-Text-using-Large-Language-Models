Heat Shock Transformation
Take competent cells from the -80°C freezer.
Use DH5α cells in most cases
Turn on water bath to 42°C.
Put competent cells in a 1.5 mL tube. For transforming a DNA construct, use 50 µL of      competent cells; for transforming a ligation, use 100 µL of competent cells. You may need     more or less, depending on how competent the cells are.
Keep tubes on ice.
Add 1 µg of circular DNA into E. coli cells. Incubate on ice for 10 min. to thaw competent cells.
Put tube(s) with DNA and E. coli into water bath at 42°C for 45 seconds.
Put tube(s) back on ice for 2 min. to reduce damage to the E. coli cells.
Add 1 mL of LB (with no antibiotic added). Incubate tubes for half an hour at 37°C. If you are      trying to grow DNA for ligation, which is more sensitive, leave the tubes for 1 hour.
Spread about 100 µL of the resulting culture on LB plates (with appropriate antibiotic added -     usually Ampicillin or Kanamycin- for selection. Grow overnight.
Pick colonies about 12-16 hours later.
