LB Medium
To 600 ml of DI H2O, add the following: 6 g tryptone, 3 g yeast extract, 6 g NaCl
Shake until the solutes are dissolved, and adjust the pH to 7.0 with 5 N NaOH. Sterilize by autoclaving on the liquid cycle at 121°C for 35 minutes.
5X M9 Salt solution and M9 Medias
M9 Salt Solution
Dissolve the following into DI H2O to a final volume of 1L:
64g Na2HPO4*7 H2O
15 g KH2PO4
25. g NaCl
5.0 g NH4Cl
Autoclave on liquid cycle to sterilize.
M9 minimal media, M9 minimal + his, M9 minimal + lac, and M9 minimal + lac + his
To 300 ml DI H2 add the following:
61.2 ml M9 salt solution
.61 ml 1M MgSO4
6.12 ml 20% glucose
0.031 ml 1M CaCl2
0.031 g 1% thiamine (vitamin B)
0.06 g uracil
10 g agar
.132 g of lac or his (for +his, +lac, and +lac+his only!)
Autoclave at 121°C for 35 minutes.
Prepare MgSO4, CaCl2, and glusoce solutions separately and sterilize by autoclaving on the liquid cycle (glucose may be sterilized by passing it through a 0.22 micrometer filter), then add them to the diluted M9 mixture.
SOC Medium
To 600 ml of DI H2O, add the following:
12 g tryptone
3 g yeast extract
0.3 g NaCl
Shake until the solutes have dissolved, and then add 10 ml of 250 mM solution of KCl. Adjust the pH of the medium to 7.0 with 5 N NaOH. Sterilize by autoclaving on the liquid cycle at 121°C for 35 minutes. After autoclaving, allow the medium to cool to 60°C or less, and add 20 ml of sterile 1M glucose. Just before use, add 5 ml of an autoclaved solution of 2M MgCl2.
