Meet the Team!
My name is Daniel Griffin, and I am a fourth year Biomedical Engineering major with a focus in Bioinstrumentation. I am originally from the northwest suburbs of Chicago and recently returned from spending a year in Japan. I joined the iGEM team this year because I wished to learn more about the fascinating field of synthetic biology and to explore how synthetic biology can be more implemented as an engineering practice.
My name is Briana Harvey, and I am a senior biology major with a pre-veterinary track from Clinton, IN. I am a member of the Rose-Hulman varsity women’s volleyball team, and a chartered member of the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology Beta Beta Beta Biological Honors Society. I joined the iGEM team this year because I wanted to explore the versatility and potential of synthetic biology, as well as gain valuable experience, knowledge, and skills that will help me to further my education and prepare me for my future.
My name is Braxton Carter. I am a senior Biology major from Bloomington, Illinois. I am a chartered member of Rose-Hulman’s Beta Beta Beta Biological Honor Society, and I am a brother of the Zeta Lambda chapter of Delta Sigma Phi. I joined the iGEM team to expand my understanding of synthetic biological systems and gain skills as a technical biologist. I want to be prepared to solve the problems of the present and future.
My name is Dani Bauhan, and I am a third year Biology major. I’m originally from Northwest Indiana. I am a member of The Gamma Lambda chapter of Chi Omega, as well as a member of the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology Beta Beta Beta Biological Honors Society and Vice President of the Rose-Hulman Biology club  I joined the iGEM team this year to learn more about synthetic biology and to gain more experience with working on a research team.
My name is Wenjun Kong. I am a third year Computer Science major. I came from a small city in the southern part of China. I am a member of the Rose-Hulman diving team, and a member of the Blue Key National Honor Society. I joined the iGEM team this year because I want to explore more in the field of synthetic biology, and learn more about how to model the biological system using engineering skills.
My name is Ayla Walter. I am a second year Painting major taking part time classes at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. I live in Terre Haute, IN. I got involved in the 2013 iGEM team as a consulting artist, and I am honored to be a team member again this year. The iGEM competition is an amazing opportunity to learn more about such an exciting field and explore the under recognized connections between art and science.
My name is Michael Riddle. I am a second year Biomedical Engineering major from Avon, Indiana. I am a member of the Biomedical Engineering Society, the Biology club, and the Beta Beta Beta Biological Honors Society. I joined iGEM this year because I was fascinated by the scope of synthetic biology and genetic engineering and the possible applications of these fields and desired to learn more about them and gain valuable experience working in a research team.
Meet Our Advisors!
Dr. Anthony teaches genetics, cell and molecular biology. His research interests focus on ribosome structure and function. He is a champion of using synthetic biology and iGEM as mediums for interdisciplinary education of undergraduates.
"Synthetic biology has the potential to address many of humanity's grand challenges. iGEM provides rich opportunities to foster the creative and critical thinking skills, and aptitude for interdisciplinary collaboration and team work, that are essential to realizing the discipline's full potential. I find it invigorating to be involved in such a worthy endeavor."
Dave Goulet teaches and studies mathematical biology. His research interests are in cellular and molecular biology and biochemistry. He’s an avid rock climber and is the faculty advisor for the Rose-Hulman rock climbing club.
"Biological systems often exhibit immense complexity and richness of behavior. The power of applied mathematics lies in its diverse set of tools capable of describing, analyzing, and making predictions regarding the behavior of complex systems. In this sense, synthetic biology is a vast and fascinating playground for applied mathematicians. I’m proud and excited to participate in iGEM. It gives me a chance to foster the development of the next generation of mathematically aware synthetic biologists."
