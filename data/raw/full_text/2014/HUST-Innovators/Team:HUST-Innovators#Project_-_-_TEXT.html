Project Description
Content
Using the conception of module ，We are trying to use the third generation sequencing to build new biobricks from some unsequncing species.This is a novel idea to combine the bioinformatics and the synthetic biology.We improve the algorithm to let the sequencing be quicker and cheaper and the output of our software includes both genome and some useful biobricks.   Then we apply this software for the Thraustochytrids which has not been sequenced yet.By analysising the output of the software，we locate the sequence which the Thraustochytrids use to produce EPA，then we use this sequence and assemble them as biobricks and transfer them into yeast which have a mechanism that control a set of particular enzyme by the concentration of lactose .So the production of EPA can be controled by lactose.      (TGS)

iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you though about your project and what works inspired you.
You can use these subtopics to further explain your project

Conclusions
It's important for teams to describe all the creativity that goes into an iGEM project, along with all the great ideas your team will come up with over the course of your work.
It's also important to clearly describe your achievements so that judges will know what you tried to do and where you succeeded. Please write your project page such that what you achieved is easy to distinguish from what you attempted.
