Since our team are sorted into 4 groups our target is constructing the Sensor cell in our system. According to our design, we need to construct two gene pathways. Consequently, we use the following parts: pLac (BBa_R0080), Promoter C and arabinose C operon (BBa_I13458), RBS (BBa_B0030), LuxI (BBa_C0061), double terminator (BBa_B0015), Constitutive promoter (BBa_J23100), CinI (BBa_C0076), pBAD (BBa_K206000), and LacI (BBa_C0012).
Week 1 7.12-7.19
1. We transformed the BBa_B0015, BBa_C0061, and BBa_B0030 plasmids into E.coli.
2. We extracted the plasmids and tested them by electrophoresis.
