PCR Protocol
Back to top
For constructing the Biobricks that we want to submit, we set up the PCR protocol and PCR system as bellows:
PCR system (For 50μL)
Materials
Volume
Taq DNA polymerase
0.5μL
Template
0.5μL
Forward Primer
1μL
Reverse Primer
1μL
dNTPs (2.5mM)
4μL
10x Buffer (Mg2+ free)
5μL
MgCl2 (25mM)
3μL
Sterilized diluted water
35μL
Note: The content of template should be less than 500ng for the 50μL system. For all of our experiments, the content of template of 0.5μL DNA lower than 500ng.
PCR protocol
Temperature
Times
95℃
5min.
30-35 Times
95℃
30sec.
55-65℃
30sec.
72℃
1-2min.
72℃
10min.
Note: for finding the optimal annealing temperature, we have done a series of gradient of annealing temperature first. And as for the elongation time, Taq DNA polymerase could synthesize DNA as the speed of 1000-2000 nucleotides per minute.
