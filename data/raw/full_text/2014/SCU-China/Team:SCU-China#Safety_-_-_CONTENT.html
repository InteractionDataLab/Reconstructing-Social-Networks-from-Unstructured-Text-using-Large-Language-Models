</DIV></DIV><H1 id="3">4. Risks of Your Project Now</H1><H3>Please describe risks of working with the biological materials (cells, organisms, DNA, etc.) that you are using in your project. If you are taking any safety precautions (even basic ones, like rubber gloves), that is because your work has some risks, however small. Therefore, please discuss possible risks and what you have done (or might do) to minimize them, instead of simply saying that there are no risks at all.</H3><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H3 class="panel-title"> Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:</H3></DIV><DIV class="panel-body">
    The engineered strains used in this project are the most commonly used E. coli DH5ÃŽÂ±, TOP10 and BL21 which cause no severe infection to human and animals and would be inactivated after experiments. The chemicals frequently used are proved to be friendly and will be handled properly by well-trained students.
</DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H3 class="panel-title">  Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):</H3></DIV><DIV class="panel-body">
   Since our experiment design is just about the common E.coli and the parts we used or modified are mostly reporters and regulator devices which have been used by former iGEM teams and proved to be innocuous. Even if they are released by accident, they won't cause any severe infection.

</DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H3 class="panel-title">  Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):</H3></DIV><DIV class="panel-body">
  The E.coli strains are widely used, so we believe they won't have much impact on the environment. Actually, we have inactivated all the strains strictly after experiments.

</DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H3 class="panel-title">   Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:</H3></DIV><DIV class="panel-body">
  No, since all the engineered strains are frequently used by researchers all over the world and mostly exist in laboratory environments. 
</DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H3 class="panel-title"> What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)</H3></DIV><DIV class="panel-body">
 All materials that touch our engineering bacteria are sterilized and all the bacteria are killed strictly. In the meantime, we ask all of our team members to take care of their own safety especially when they do the experiments with some deleterious compounds such as EB.
 
</DIV></DIV><H1 id="4">5. Risks of Your Project in the Future</H1><H3>What would happen if all your dreams came true, and your project grew from a small lab study into a commercial/industrial/medical product that was used by many people? We invite you to speculate broadly and discuss possibilities, rather than providing definite answers. Even if the product is &quot;safe&quot;, please discuss possible risks and how they could be addressed, rather than simply saying that there are no risks at all.</H3><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H3 class="panel-title">What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?</H3></DIV><DIV class="panel-body">
 In our project, all the bacteria we used are harmless bacteria and all the plasmids are harmless too, though, but we need to culture those bacteria together. As a result, we must concede there is a little possibility producing some harmful materials because of the gene communications.
</DIV></DIV><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H3 class="panel-title"> Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.</H3></DIV><DIV class="panel-body">
 One of the applications of our project is to produce some useful products via the complex gene pathways. And the first thing that we should take into consideration is the side products especially these deleterious side products. Under this suituation, we suggest that we should keep our gene pathways as simple as possible.
</DIV></DIV><H1 id="5">6. Further Comments</H1><H3>If you are completing a Preliminary Version of your Safety Form, use this space to describe how far you have progressed in your project, and give some comments about any questions that you left blank.</H3><DIV class="panel panel-default"><DIV class="panel-heading"><H3 class="panel-title">You can also use this space for any other comments or additional material.</H3></DIV><DIV class="panel-body">
 According to my consideration, we carried out the safety form extremely strictly in the parts about the safety of our team members and our lab because the most precious thing for everyone is their life. However, in the meanwhile, we also cannot deny that we did something not very well in the parts about the potential problems of our project because we don't and we cannot take everything into consideration especially for the application of our project in that there is still a pretty long way to go. But, The only thing that I can say without any hesitation is that we did the BEST that we CAN.
