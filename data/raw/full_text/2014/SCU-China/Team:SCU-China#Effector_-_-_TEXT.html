Since our team are sorted into different groups, we are focusing on constructing the Effector Cell. Totally, we should build 3 different effector cells to fulfill our project. In detail, we make use of the following biobricks to construct the effector cells. They are pLas (BBa_R0079), Constitutive Promoter (BBa_J23106), pLas/lux (BBa_K091146), RBS (BBa_B0034), RFP (BBa_E1010), amilCP (BBa_K592009), cjBlue (BBa_K592011), LasR (BBa_C0079), DT (BBa_B0015).
Week 1 7.17-7.20
1. We transformed the plasmids (BBa_R0079, BBa_J23106, BBa_K091146, BBa_B0034, BBa_E1010, BBa_K592009, BBa_K592011, BBa_C0079, BBa_B0015) to amplify them.
2. We extracted the plasmids (mentioned above) and did the electrophoresis to test the quality and concentration of them.

Week 2 7.21-7.27
1. We picked up colonies from the plates made last time and did the liquid culture of bacteria that contain the plasmid (mentioned above).
2. We stored the bacteria that contain plasmids (mentioned above) with glycerol in -80℃.
3. We extracted the plasmids again.
4. We cleaved the plasmids (BBa_B0034 and BBa_K592011) in 37℃.
Results
1. For plasmids prep, the concentration was too low and we discarded them.
2. For cleavage, there was no line appearing on gel.
Week 3 7.28-8.03
1. We transformed BBa_I71204, BBa_I1466, BBa_K575014, BBa_J23100, BBa_I718013, BBa_K592025, BBa_S03156, BBa_I13401, BBa_C0171 plasmids into E.Coli and extracted the plasmids.
2. We cleaved the plasmids mentioned above by the EcoR I and Spe I (BBa_I13401, BBa_S03156, BBa_B0015, BBa_I1466, BBa_K592025) or Xba I and Pst I (BBa_J23100, BBa_C0171, BBa_K575014).
3. We tested our cleavage products by electrophoresis.

Week 4 8.04-8.10
1. We cleaved the backbones with Kanamycin and Ampicillin resistance.
2. We linked the biobricks with our backbones via 3A assembly. In detail, we linked the BBa_B0015 and BBa_C0171 with pSB1A3 (named A1); the BBa_B0015 and BBa_K575014 with pSB1A3 (A2); the BBa_S03156 and BBa_J23100 with pSB1K3 (K1); and the BBa_I1466 and BBa_J23100 with pSB1K3 (K2).
3. We transformed our linkage products into E.coli. and did the liquid culture to amplify the products. And then we extracted the plasmids which are tested by cleavage and electrophoresis.
4. We cleaved the pSB1C3 serving as the backbones to link A2 with K2 (C1) and A1 with K1 (C2).
5. We linked the BBa_K592025 and BBa_B0015 with pSB1A3 (A3).
6. We cleaved BBa_K592025 and BBa_B0015.
