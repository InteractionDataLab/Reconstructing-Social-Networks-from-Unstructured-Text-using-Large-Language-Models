Week 5
Since our team is sorted into 4 groups, our team is focusing on the construction of the Transmitter Cell. The whole work that we should do is to build 2 gene lines which lie in the transmitter cells.
In detail, we use 9 biobricks supplied by IGEM Competition totally which are RBS (BBa_B0030), DT (BBa_B0015), pLux (BBa_R0062), LuxR (BBa_C0062), LasI (BBa_K081016 and BBa_K081009), CinR (BBa_K0077), RhlR (BBa_C0171), and RhlI (BBa_C0051).
Week 1 7.20-7.26
1. We transformed the plasmids (BBa_B0030, BBa_B0015, BBa_R0062, BBa_K081016, BBa_K081009, BBa_K0077, BBa_C0171, BBa_C0051) into DH5α E.Coli to amplify these plasmid
We extracted the plasmids (mentioned above) and used electrophoresis to test the concentration and quality of our plasmids.

Note: The different concentrations are from different tubes.
Week 2 7.27-8.03
1. We transformed the BBa_C0062 and BBa_C0077 plasmids.
2. We extracted the BBa_J37019, BBa_I9026, BBa_K081005, BBa_I714075, BBa_K93600 and BBa_R0077 plasmids and determined the concentration of them by electrophoresis.
3. We cleaved the BBa_R0062, BBa_C0051, BBa_K0077 plasmids with EcoR I and Spe I enzyme and BBa_B0015 with Xba I and Pst I. Also, we prepared the pSB1A3 and pSB1K3 backbones with EcoR I and Pst I.
4. We cleaved the BBa_J37019 (Named E11) and BBa_R0077 (E21) with EcoR I and Spe I, BBa_I9026 (E12), BBa_K081016 (E22) and BBa_C0077 (E24) with Xba I and Pst I.
5. We linked the E11 and E12 with pSB1A3 (L11), the E21 and E22 with pSB1A3 (L21).
6. We transformed all the linked parts into E.coli.
7. We cleaved BBa_B0015 with Xba I and Pst I.

Week 3 8.04-8.10
1. We linked the L1 and BBa_B0015 with pSB1T3 (named F1), L2 and BBa_I9026 with pSB1T3 (F2). Then we transformed them into E.coli to amplify them and we extracted the plasmids to test their quality.
2. We linked E11 and E12 with pSB1T3 (named LA1), E21 and E22 with pSB1A3 (LA2).
3. We cleaved the BBa_J37019 (Named E11) and BBa_R0077 (E21) with EcoR I and Spe I, BBa_I9026 (E12), BBa_K081016 (E22) and BBa_C0077 (E24) with Xba I and Pst I again and tested their qualities by electrophoresis and then we did the gel purification.
4. We cleaved the BBa_R0077 with Spe I and Pst I (named EP21).
5. We linked EP21 and E22 with 3 different backbones (pSB1T3, pSB1A3, and pSB1C3) which are tested by electrophoresis.
