Outreach
We tightly communicate with several iGEM teams to improve our idea and appreciate their work.
With Shanghai JiaoTong University
On 19th April, we invited SJTU to have a mini iGEM communication meeting with us.
Our guests helped analyse which project is significant to the reality and can be achieved.
Members from Tongji University shared their opinions upon the last year's iGEM projects.
What’s your expectation for iGEM? What should an iGEM team do? What’s the challenge?
What’s synthetic biology? How is it developing currently? What's the trend?
Members from Tongji University shared their opinions upon the last year's iGEM projects.
How to lead a team? How to work efficiently?

On 19th April, we invited members from Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU) to have a mini iGEM communication meeting with us.
During the meeting, SJTU introduced iGEM competition and synthetic biology, shared their experience in team management, and discussed some last year's iGEM projects .
Thank SJTU for giving us a mini but meaningful iGEM communication meeting. We are looking forward to our further collaboration.
With Fudan University
On 8th June, We had another communication meeting with team Fudan.
Team Fudan's project idea was fantastic!
They said they need certain vector in their project.
We are happy to help them.

Help another team
During this summer, we provided assistance within our capacity to Fudan , another iGEM team.
Our professor gave them instruction and resources
Provide some significant information about cell cultivation
Provide them with the plasmid vectors

We offer help to Fudan University on their iGEM project, including:
Assistance
Item
Detail
Provide a plasmid vector named ‘fvw-tet-oskm’
It is a plasmid containing the four Yamanaka factors(Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc), and the factors are connected with a T2A linker. It can be used to induce iPSCs.
Provide a plasmid vector named ‘fvw-tet-sox2’
It is a plasmid containing the gene, Sox2. It can be used to induce neuron stem cells.
Provide some significant information about cell cultivation
We provide the recipe of medium and the protocol for cultivating for neuron cells, iPSCs                   and neuron stem cells.
Help to solve some detailed problems
We also help them to solve some detailed problems, such as helping to choose markers for iPSc screening and recommending kits and reagents for their experiments.
