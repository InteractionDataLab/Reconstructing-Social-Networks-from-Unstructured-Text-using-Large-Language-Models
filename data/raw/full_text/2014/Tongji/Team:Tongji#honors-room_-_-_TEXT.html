Comments
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
Validation experiment conducted, please see Lab Archives.
Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
Please see Lab Archives.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry
Please see Lab Archives.
Your project may have implications for the environment, security, safety and ethics and/or ownership and sharing. Describe one or more ways in which these or other broader implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of your project.
Please see Safety.

Synergy exploration
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Fudan owes us a big favour for lentivirus vector we gave them.

Please enjoy our story.
Basically, we are a self-funding team. Three of our team members paid the registration fee of $3500 at first, and then our college became willing to give us a experimental funding of $5000. And we paid the rest.
We are an independent group. We raised our own idea, we modified our idea, and we troubleshot the problems we encountered. And the reason we can technically survive without help from outside is we have talented core members, especially Mr.Jiang, who read mountains of papers and found solutions to many obstacles.
Almost all we present here, come from our team members officially listed. Technically, we don't have to say thank-you to someone from outside. You can find the detailed work of our team members below.

Jian Gao 高健
Carried out the pilot experiment of in-lab paper making process.
Liang Jiang 姜亮
Carried out more than 80% of total experiment with Yixiao Zhou, including PCR, vector construction, transfection, positive selection, expression and purification of enzyme, bio-chemical validation of enzyme. He deserved to be our prior scientis, since he spent much of his private time and even working time on our project, and made several important decisions.
Ling Leng 冷泠
Participated in paper decoloring experiment and expression of enzyme.
NanFang Hong 洪楠方
Project initiator and investor, responsible for internal communication, team design and development of wiki. Participated in paper decoloring experiment.
Shisheng Zhang 张仕晟
Project initiator and investor, undertook the the complex administrative and logistics work.
Yixiao Zhou 周一枭
Project initiator and investor, Carried out more than 80% of total experiment with Liang Jiang, including PCR, vector construction, transfection, positive selection, expression and purification of enzyme, bio-chemical validation of enzyme.
Yu Chen 陈御
Undertook part of administrative work and participated paper decoloring experiment. And provided important suggestion on many occasions.
Yue Qi 祁玥
Carried out the cultivation of our thermophilic gene host bacterium (Clostridium stercorarium). Responsible for paper decoloring experiment and Safety paperwork.
Zixuan Zhang 张子轩
Participated expression of enzyme.
Mengjie Zhang 张梦杰
Our advisor through the whole project. She intended to give us the chances to explore by our own, instead of feeding us the answer. We harvested a lot! Thank you!
Chenxi Jin 金晨希
Designed Synergy and Hot Resistance icons.
