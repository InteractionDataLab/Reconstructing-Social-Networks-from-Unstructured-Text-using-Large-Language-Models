Protocols
The protocols used in our cloning process are listed below. These are standard versions of the protocols mentioned in our notebooks, and we hope that they will be of use to anyone using the Chimera workflow. We have also included a 3-day flow cytometry workflow for setting up samples for characterization.
CIP dephosphorylation
Colony PCR
Epoch spin miniprep
Epoch spin PCR cleanup
Ligation
Media preparation
MoClo Level 1 and 2
NanoDrop quantification
Phusion PCR
Restriction Digest
Transformation
