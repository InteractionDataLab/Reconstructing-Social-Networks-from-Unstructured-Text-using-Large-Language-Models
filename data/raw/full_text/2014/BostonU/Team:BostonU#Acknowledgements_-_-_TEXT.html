ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Acknowledgements
CIDAR Lab
Professor Douglas Densmore
Primary Investigator, CIDAR Lab at Boston University
We would like to thank Professor Densmore for use of his lab space and his support throughout the summer.
Dr. Ernst Oberortner
Postdoctoral Researcher, CIDAR Lab at Boston University
We would also like to thank Dr. Ernst Oberortner for his help with Eugene and the priority encoder design.
Academic
Orit Shaer
Primary Investigator, HCI Lab at Wellesley College
We would like to thank Professor Orit Shaer for teaching us more about Bio-design Automation and for allowing us to collaborate with her lab to learn more about integrating computational tools with experimental lab work. We would also like to thank the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) lab at Wellesley for allowing us to use the Google Glass in our lab.
Ariela Esmurria
We would like to thank high school student Ariela Esmurria for helping us with the Interlab study.
Diego Cuerda Gil
We would like to thank Diego Cuerda Gil for his help in finishing cloning origins of replication.
Corporate Collaborations
Dr. Jacob Beal
Research Scientist, BBN Technologies
We would like to thank Dr. Jacob Beal from BBN Technologies for teaching us how to use the BBN Synthetic Biology TASBE Tools and helping us troubleshoot the software if an error happened.
Contributions
The wetlab work was completed by Yash Agarwal (fusion proteins), Alan Pacheco (new vector backbones), and Katie Lewis (tandem promoters). Our advisor, Traci Haddock, and our mentor, Evan Appleton, trained us in the lab and provided us troubleshooting advice throughout the project. All team members and advisors contributed to the wiki. Alan designed the wiki framework. Ariela Esmurria, a high school student volunteer, did the wetlab work for the Interlab Study.
The genetic device graphics were all generated from Pigeon .
Bhatia, S. & Densmore, D. Pigeon: a design visualizer for synthetic biology. ACS Synth. Biol. 2, 348–350 (2013).
Sponsors
We'd like to thank all of our sponsors for their generous support. Without the support from the following Boston University departments and corporate sponsors, we would not have been able to compete in iGEM. We would specifically like to thank:
Financial sponsors: Boston University, UROP, and Center of Synthetic Biology (CoSBi)
Supplies sponsors: Tecan, BD, Epoch, BioLabs
BDAC for sponsoring our NEGEM lunches
Thank you very much! Without your generous support, this project would not have been possible!
