The general plan to replace the backbones was formulated, which comprised of:1. Using PCR to extract the backbones without their high-copy origins from their full destination vectors, and to extract the lower-copy origins from their respective plasmids.

•	Since gel verification was successful, performed PCR in triplicate of backbones and origins with same reaction conditions.
•	Performed PCR cleanup and quantified using Nanodrop spectrophotometer. DVL1_AE had a very low DNA concentration compared to negative control → repeat PCR.

•	Performed ligation of each backbone with each new origin. and transformed onto Kanamycin (for DVL1 backbones) and Ampicillin (for DVL2 backbones) plates with X-Gal and IPTG. Because of the intact LacZ fragment in the plasmid, the presence of IPTG will allow for activation of β-galactosidase, which will react with X-Gal to produce blue-pigmented colonies.
•	Successful blue colonies grew for DVL1_ColE1, DVL1_p15A, DVL1_pSC101, and DVL2_ColE1. No growth observed for DVL2_p15A or DVL2_pSC101. → Repeat ligation step from purified RD.
•	Re-transformed DVL2_p15A and DVL2_pSC101 ligations and performed blue-white screening after overnight incubation. Blue colonies grew for DVL2_pSC101, but blue and white colonies grew for DVL2_p15A. This should not be the case, as any plasmid without the LacZ fragment should not have an origin, and therefore should not have replicated.

•	Gel from colony PCR verified the presence of the origin on DVL1_ColE1 and DVL2_ColE1, but the PCR failed on all others. The likely cause is that the original templates of DVL1_AE, DVL2_AF (with their intact high-copy pMB1 origins), and the complete devices containing the lower copy plasmids made it past the PCR and all purifications. The pXcpi device (containing the p15 ori) had Ampicillin resistance but no LacZ fragment, which explains the white colonies on the DVL2_p15A plate.<CENTER><CAPT>Portion of Colony PCR gel showing no primer binding on p15A and pSC101 clones.</CAPT></CENTER>
•	To relieve this problem, the purified restriction digests were separated by gel electrophoresis, and a Qiagen gel extraction was performed to remove the bands of desired length. The desired origins and backbones were easy to pick out, since the origins vary from 750bp-950bp, distinguishing them in size from their parent constructs.

•	A new cloning strategy was devised to attempt elimination of template contamination and re-ligation. The enzyme BseYi, which has only one cut site within the pMB1 origin, would be used to linearize the DVL1 and DVL2 backbones. This digest would be dephosphorylated with Calf Intestinal Phosphatase (CIP) to prevent re-ligation of template. PCR amplification of the backbones would proceed as before with the MfeI primers, and these amplicons would also be digested with CIP after gel extraction. Following this second dephosphorylation, the MfeI digest, ligation, and transformation would proceed as before.
•	The BseYI restriction endonuclease was ordered for this new strategy.</TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" scope="col"><H3>Week of September 15</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" scope="col">
•	The backbones were digested and dephosphorylated according to the most recent cloning strategy, and transformed.
•	Due to the amount of PCR/digest spin cleanups performed with this new strategy (4 spin cleanups and 1 gel extraction vs. 1 spin cleanup and 1 gel extraction in previous protocol), the yield of ligated DNA was very low. This resulted in no colonies growing for any of the experiments.
•	The strategy was again altered, this time to include two different restriction sites on each end of the origin and backbone amplicons. The restriction endonuclease AscI was selected, as the original backbones and origins did not have any sites specific to this enzyme. Reverse PCR primers were altered to add AscI cut sites on one end of amplicons.  (Detailed primer design available <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/0/06/Primer_Design_9-17_BU14.xls">here</A>) This strategy was aimed at returning to previous levels of cleanups to maximize yield, while eliminating background and self-ligation of template.<CENTER><CAPT>Summary of new cloning strategy with two restriction endonucleases.</CAPT></CENTER></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" scope="col"><H3>Week of September 22</H3></TD></TR><TR><TD colspan="2" scope="col">
•	The new primers were used to add an AscI site on one end of the DVL1, DVL2, ColE1, p15A, and pSC101 amplicons in the initial PCR step. The old forward primers were also used to add an MfeI site to the other end. This PCR was performed in triplicate to avoid loss of yield after the gel extraction.
