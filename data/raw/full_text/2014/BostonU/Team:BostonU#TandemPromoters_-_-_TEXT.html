Notebook: Tandem Promoters
This notebook will delineate the steps taken and the parts used to create a library of MoClo level 0 (AK, KB, AB fusion sites) tandem promoter parts as well as the level 1 and level 2 parts created to test them. It also includes the steps taken to add several new gene (CD fusion sites) and terminator (DF fusion sites) MoClo parts to our library. The following ladder was used in all of the gels to determine the size of each genetic part I was building:
June
Week of June 23
Plasmids from addgene:
   Genes: Bm3RI, BetI, Ph1F, SrpR, LrmA
   Terminators: L3S2P21, ECK120015170
   Destination Vectors: pICH89921, pICH82113    
Struck out genes and terminators onto Amp plates
Struck out Destination Vectors onto Kan plates
Picked two colonies from each plate- one for minipreps & one for frozen stocks
Ordered primers for genes and terminators
Miniprepped terminators and genes
Made frozen stocks for all plasmids
Diluted primers and did PCR reactions for genes and terminators
Poured LB, LB+Amp, and LB+Kan plates
Week of June 30
BM3RI, BetI, Ph1F, SrpR, LmrA, L3S2P21, ECK120015170    
Ran gel for previous PCR reactions
Two terminators were too small to see well on gel
PCR in triplicate for all genes and terminators as well as negative control
PCR clean-up
Didn't work for ECK120015170 because it was too small & fell through the filter
Level 0 MoClo reactions for BM3RI, BetI, SrpR, LmrA, L3S2P21
Redid PCR for ECK120015170
Level 0 MoClo reaction for ECK120015170
Transformations for all Level 0 MoClo reactions
None of the transformations worked
Accidentally used Pro cell strain with Cam resistance
Redid MoClo reactions and transformations for all parts
Ordered promoters for pBad, pTet, pA1LacO, and R0051
Used colony PCR to verify transformations worked
July
Week of July 7
This week I used the google glass for all protocols to give Wellesley College feedback on one of their software projects.
BM3RI, BetI, Ph1F, SrpR, LmrA, L3S2P21, ECK120015170    
Ran gel for colony PCR reactions
Picked colonies to grow overnight for the parts that turned out well on the gel
BM3RI, BetI, SrpR, LmrA, ECK120015170
Redid transformations for Ph1F, L3S2P21, SrpR, and ECK120015170
SrpR and ECK120015170 looked questionable on the gel so I redid them just in case
Miniprepped overnight cultures and sent for sequencing
Analyzed sequencing results and confirmed BM3R1, BetI, LmrA, and ECK120015170
SrpR came back as LacZ, which means it wasn't properly transformed
Picked confirmed colonies from stab plate, grew overnight, and made frozen stocks
Miniprepped SrpR, Ph1F, and L3S2P21 and sent for sequencing
Analyzed sequencing results and confirmed SrpR and L3S2P21
Redid colony PCR for Ph1F because it had too low concentration for sequencing
pBad, pTet, pA1LacO, R0051
Diluted pBad, pTet, pA1LacO, and R0051 primers
PCR for pBad, pTet, and pA1LacO
Held off temporarily on R0051 because we didn't have the R0051_Rev_B primer that we thought we had
For each part we made AK and KB fusion site using the new fusion site, K, that we designed (ATGC)
Level 0 MoClo reactions in DVL0_AB
pTet-pBad, pTet-pA1LacO, pBad-pTet, pBad-pA1LacO, pA1LacO-pBad, pA1LacO-pTet
Transformations for level 0 tandem promoter MoClo reactions in bioline cells
Week of July 14
In addition to my wetlab work this week I cleaned the lab, refilled stocks, and autoclaved backup supplies. I also talked to female high school students about iGEM and my experience with science and research to encourage them to pursue a science related field in university.
pBad, pTet, pA1LacO
Created stab plate and picked two colonies from each transformation plate
Miniprepped overnight cultures and sent level 0 tandem promoter MoClo parts in for sequencing
Analyzed sequences
Only the pTet-pBad tandem promoter turned out correctly
Noticed that the pA1LacO promoter has a large repeating sequence
PCR temperature that I used was too high (too specific causing reverse primer to bind to the wrong part)
Redid PCR for pBad (AK) and pA1LacO (AK, KB)
Redid MoClo & Transformations for pBad-pTet, pBad-pA1LacO, pA1LacO-pTet, pA1LacO-pBad, pTet-pA1LacO
R0051
Received and diluted R0051_Rev_B primer
L3S2P21, SrpR
Made frozen stocks from the confirmed colonies
Week of July 21
pBad, pTet, pA1LacO
Colony PCR for pBad-pTet, pBad-pA1LacO, pA1LacO-pTet, pA1LacO-pBad, pTet-pA1LacO
Miniprepped and sent for sequencing
pBad-pTet confirmed
pA1LacO still not amplifying correctly
Redid PCR
3% gel
Redid PCR again
Made frozen stocks for pBad-pTet and pTet-pBad
PhlF
Redid PCR & ran gel
Redid MoClo and transformations
Miniprepped and sent for sequencing

Nothing detected for BM3R1
SrpR gene and BCD2 were detected
pA1LacO
Struck out and miniprepped DVL0_AB
MoClo and transformations with pTet_AK & pBad_AK
Also tried redoing PCR with 20ul instead of 50ul and used gradient with 57C and 61C
Ran gel and both AK and KB looked good
Did MoClo, transformations, and minipreps
Other accomplishments
Streaked out and grew J23104_FB and B0015_DG because we will need them later for priority encoder
Week of August 11
This week I cleaned the lab. We also temporarily lost our ability to send samples for sequencing due to a problem with our PO box.
Tandem Promoters
Built Level 1 J23104-BCD2-TetR-B0015 to test pBad-pTet and pTet-pBad level 1s
I'll test using pro cells and also using a level two testing device
I designed and ordered new primers for pA1LacO_AK and pA1LacO_KB
Since the PCR reactions for pA1LacO appear to be working, I tried changing the transformation conditions
Tried changing the recovery and overnight temperature to 30 degrees C
Transformations didn't grow in 30 so I switched them over to the 37
Ran colony PCR (1.5% gel) and used incorrect sequenced tandem promoters as controls to compare them to
The gel looked potentially correct, so I grew overnight
Ran digest
pA1LacO-pBad looked correct, but it's hard to tell since there's only a 34 bp difference between correct and the incorrect ones I've been getting
Week of August 18
Tandem Promoters
Redid MoClo reactions and transformations
After 24 hours, the transformations didn't grow in 30
Redid transformations with one 30 plate and one 37 plate for each tandem promoter
Colony PCR for TetR level 1 and tandem promoters
Redid 30 transformations
Transformations looked good so I miniprepped adn sent for sequencing
Transformed pBad-pTet and pTet-pBad level 1s into pro cells
New Backbones
I will be creating AK, KB backbones as well as DVL2_AE backbone with Amp resistance
PCR reaction to get LacZ_AK, LacZ_KB, LacZ_AE
Ran gel for LacZ fragments
Gel looked good, so I did PCR cleanup for them
Restriction digest for CAM and AMP backbones and LacZ fragments
Ran 1.5% gel for digests
Gel extraction and ligations
Transformed backbones

Made DH5alpha strain competent cells
Week of August 25
New Backbones
DVL2_AE didn't grow, but picked colonies for DVL0_AK, DVL0_KB
DVL0_KB didn't grow overnight
Sent DVL0_AK for sequencing
Retransformed DVL2_AE
DVL0_AK came back with AE fusion sites, so I might've mixed up labeling
Redid ligations for all backbones
Redid transformations in bioline cells
Miniprepped and sent for sequencing
Tandem Promoters
Incorrect sequencing again
Possibly a toxicity problem
plan on transforming into DH5alpha pro cells (represses pBad/pTet/pA1LacO promoters)
Redid transformations in pro cells
Also transformed known plasmid to calculate efficiency of pro cells
After recovery, there was barely any pellet for the promoters
Transformations didn't grow
Redid transformations again using two different sets of pro cells
Didn't grow again
September
Week of September 2 and Week of September 9
New Backbones
DVL0_AK and DVL0_KB were correctly sequenced

Flow Cytometry set up for pTet-pBad with new small molecule concentrations
Somehow plates got mixed up, so flow results were not correct
Flow graphs showed GFP expression instead of RFP expression
Struck out -20 and -80 frozen stocks for pBad-pTet level 1 and pTet-pBad level 1 to give to WPI
Also made small molecule media to give to them
They will do confocal microscopy with tandem promoters
