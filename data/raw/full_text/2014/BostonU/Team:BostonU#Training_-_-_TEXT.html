Training Notebook
This notebook details the concepts, methods, and protocols learned throughout the iGEM process by all of the BU team members.
May
Week of May 12
• Learned about synthetic biology, iGEM, and MoClo.
• Became familiar with lab part and BioBrick part nomenclature.
• Learned how to use miniEugene from CIDAR lab members.
• Developed plan for next two weeks that would guide through training of essential lab protocols - specifically plate streaking, minipreps, MoClo, sequencing, and colony PCR.
• Began using miniEugene to design architecture of constructs.
• Struck out plates with 15 L0 parts, 6 L1 parts, and 2 L2 parts and grew colonies in liquid cultures overnight.
Week of May 19
• Performed minipreps and quantified the DNA concentration of parts using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.
• Sent the parts for sequencing, all but four of which were correctly verified using BLAST. Parts not correctly verified were re-submitted for sequencing.
• Transformed verified parts into E. Coli Bioline cells and performed colony PCR and gel electrophoresis.
Week of May 26
• Analyzed gels and picked colonies.
• Performed minipreps on gel-verified strains.
• Made glycerol stocks of confirmed parts.
• Set up and performed MoClo reactions to make 2 new L1 parts.
• Transformed MoClo reactions and grew up over the weekend.
June
Week of June 2
• Picked colonies, miniprepped, quantifies, and sent parts for sequence verification.
• Set up and performed MoClo reaction for 2 new L1 and 2 new L2 parts.
• Transformed reactions and grew up overnight.
• Brainstormed to further define project goals.
Week of June 9
• Participated in SB2 (Synthetic Biology Boston) and IWBDA (Internatonal Workshop on Bio-Design Automation) workshops hosted at BU.
Week of June 16
• Set up parts for FACS experiment.
• Participated in NEGEM meetup.
