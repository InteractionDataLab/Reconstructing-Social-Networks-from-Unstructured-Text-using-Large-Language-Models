Safety
The team worked solely with BSL1 organisms and DNA parts this summer. As such, we followed standard operating procedures for BSL1 organisms as outlined by Boston University's Environmental Health and Safety department. As such, team members wore nitrile gloves, long pants, and laboratory coats while working in the lab this summer. Biological waste was disposed of based on BU's Biological Waste guidlines provided to researchers on the Charles River Campus. All sharps, including pipette tips, were disposed of in Sharps Containers provided by BU following the specified Sharps Guidelines . Due to the use of SYBR dye or ethidium bromide, DNA agarose gels were treated as chemical waste and disposed of in a specific collection container labeled appropriately. Likewise, miniprep kit waste was collected in chemical waste containers labeled appropriately. Both types of chemical waste were located in secondary containment bins according to BU's Chemical Waste policy. Along with following BU's SOPs for BSL1 safety and waste removal, the team ensured a clean and safe working environment by following the rules outlined by the Center of Synthetic Biology labs. Benches and pipettes were wiped down with 70% ethanol at the start and end of each work day. Plasmid DNA was stored at -20˚C and glycerol stocks were stored at both -20˚C and -80˚C. Gloves were disposed of in the Biological Waste containers.
