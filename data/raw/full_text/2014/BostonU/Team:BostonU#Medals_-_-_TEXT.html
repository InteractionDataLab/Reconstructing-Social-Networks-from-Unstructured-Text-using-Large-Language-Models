ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Medal Fulfillment
We outline our medal completion below, as per the Jamboree and measurement track guidelines found here .
Gold Medal
✓        Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system. See our collaborations page for details on our collaboration with WPI, MIT, and Tufts!
✓        Demonstrate a substantial improvement over the state of the art in cost, efficiency, precision, resolution, and/or other relevant capabilities of your measurement technique. See our Workflow and our Example pages for details on our bio-design automation characterization workflow.
Silver Medal
✓        Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. We have validated that our tandem promoters function: BBa_K1401007 and BBa_K1401008 .
✓        Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. We have documented our tandem promoters: BBa_K1401007 and BBa_K1401008 .
✓        Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). Both tandem promoter parts were submitted to iGEM.
✓        iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted. See our Policy and Practices page for our report on our experience at the International Workshop for Bio-Design Automation (IWBDA)!
Bronze Medal
✓        Team registration.
✓        Complete Judging form.
✓        Team Wiki.
✓        Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
✓        The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. Please see our Acknowledgements page for all attributions.
✓        Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. We have submitted our tandem promoters: BBa_K1401007 and BBa_K1401008 .
✓        Participate in the InterLab study. We have completed the Measurement Interlab Study
