We have arranged the third SynBio Party to get attention to iGEM and Synthetic Biology
Hello dear iGEMers, it's Ilkem Kumru here. I am a senior student in Biology Department of Middle East Technical University. This is my second year in iGEM. I take part in Wet Lab, P&P,
Modeling, wiki designing and everything else. I always wanted to be even a small piece of biological sciences from my childhood. I am extremely happy to take place in METU iGEM Team,
where everyone works with enthusiasm and excitement to discover new frontiers. A biology laboratory where we work iGEM is the place where I can live and work till death
, and it is also the only place where I feel myself as immortal as my love of science.
