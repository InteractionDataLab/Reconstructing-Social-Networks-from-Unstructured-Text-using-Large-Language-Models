Dry lab
As a team that participates in the iGEM competition for the first time , the lack of experience is our weakness,but do so many human practice really has the positive influence . We joined in many iGEM MeetUps which is held by other colleges to get more experience , and we found our own insufficient from the communication to other iGEMers.There is no doubt that we got a lot of inspirement from them,meanwhile,we deeply realized that all the iGEMers had helped each other without thinking of personal gain. iGEM competition js more than a simple competition to us.It is more like a reunion of iGEMers who are interested in synthetic biology.We can realize our dreams together!
Synthetic biology is a cross discipline,so how can we truly achieve to put the laboratory research into the application of reality is a difficult question needing to be solved.The first thing we think of is the pharmaceutical engineering.In order to learn more, we tried to communicate with some of  local pharmaceutical groups, and  visited their factory.We understood   some  factory workshop`s operation, and then introduced them how may synthetic biology can be used to their production.At last,we showed detailed descriptions on our project.
