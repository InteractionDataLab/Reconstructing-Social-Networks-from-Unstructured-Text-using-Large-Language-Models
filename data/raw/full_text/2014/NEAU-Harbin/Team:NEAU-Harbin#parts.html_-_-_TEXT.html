1AmilCP
2cjBlue
3eGFP
4crtE+crtB
5crtY+crtZ
6crtY+crtZ+crtI
AmilCP
This is the chromoprotein which displays blue color in nature sunlight,and it can be visual to the naked eye rather than UV detector . It has already been codon optimized for improving the expression level in Aspergillus niger.
cjBlue
This is the chromoprotein which displays green color in nature sunlight. It has also been codon optimized for improving the expression level in Aspergillus niger.
eGFP
This is the green fluorescence protein which can reach its maximum expression level in the eucaryotic systems. It can be used as the seletive marker gene in the gene tracer system to screen out the colonies that experienced the hygromycin’s deletion.
crtE+crtB
This is the fusion protein of Geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase(crtE) and phytoene synthase(crtB). It can realize the reaction from farnesyl diphosphate to phytoene.Between the two single genes there is the linker peptide sequence GSGSGSGSGS to connect them together.
crtY+crtZ
This is the fusion protein of lycopene β-cyclase (crtY) and 3,(3)-β-ionone hydroxylase(crtZ). It can realize the reaction from lycopene to zeaxanthin .Between the two single genes there is the linker peptide sequence GSGSGSGSGS to connect them together.
crtY+crtZ+crtI
This is the fusion protein of lycopene β-cyclase (crtY) , 3,(3)-β-ionone hydroxylase(crtZ) and phytoene desaturase(crtI). It can realize the reaction from phytoene to zeaxanthin .Between every two single genes there is the linker peptide sequence GSGSGSGSGS to connect them together.
