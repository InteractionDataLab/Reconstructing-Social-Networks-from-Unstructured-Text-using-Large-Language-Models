1.The high-efficiency expression host—Aspergillus niger  is coming!
Aspergillus Niger is an important fermentation  microbial ,which is widely used in industrial enzymes'production and organic  acid fermentation.It can produce more than 30 kinds of enzyme product such as  amylase, acid protease, cellulase, pectinase and glucose oxidase. In fact, Aspergillus  Niger has been applied in the field of food production for a long time.Because  of its excellent ability of secreting proteins, Aspergillus Niger is developed  for universal heterologous protein expression host.
As receptor bacteria of? genetic engineering ,Aspergillus Niger  has? unique advantages upon bacteria and  yeast .It's able to do majority? kinds of  processing after translation , and the glycosylation system is similar to that  of higher eukaryotes.It's well known for high protein secretion capacity and  recognized as the safe strain for heterologous protein production,in that the  fermentation and post-processing technologies are mature.In addition,its genome  sequences has already been published. ?
2.Why AMT？
Agrobacterium-mediated  fungal transformation(AMT)is a potential tool for performing? targeted and random mutagenesis .This method  is commonly used for plant-cell transformations and recently widely applied to  various fungus. In the AMT system,A.Tumefaciens is able to transfer T-DNA to a  wide variety of fungi ,and it has especial high efficiency.
The gram-negative bacterium A. tumefaciens is a  plant pathogen, which causes crown gall tumors.A. tumefaciens  induces this tumorous growth by transferring a part of its DNA (T-DNA) ,which  is located on its 200-kbp tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid to the host. After  integration into the host genome, genes that are naturally located on this  T-DNA and encode enzymes for the production of metabolites and regulators for  the plant growth.  But  another segment,the virulence region, which is composed of a large number of  vir genes,is necessary for the tumorigenicity .So the binary vector system is  used,in which the T-DNA and the virulence region are placed on two separate  plasmids.
 
3. Targeted gene replacement  system
(1)The targeted gene replacement system mainly  adopts the principle of homologous gene recombination. ?We import homologous gene sequences to the  nuclear genome specific receptor gene loci and replace the original genes ,so  that we can achieve our purpose of modifying the original genome. In the? process of target gene replacement , the construction  of vectors ?is of great importance, which  typically includes 2 arms ,respectively in homology with the target gene’s  homologous sequences on both sides ,and 1 selection marker gene which is used  to eliminate noise bacteria. In our universal system, we choose GlaA5 and GlaA3 as the homologous arms on either side of the target  gene site and HPH (hygromycin) as selective marker.
(2)In our  previous detection methods in target gene replacement, we usually extract the genome  and ?conduct the PCR detection, using the  homology arms as primiers, which is somewhat complex and time-consuming .

(3)The noise from NHEJ
The insertion of exogenous  gene may include another circumstance that the nonhomologous end,? not dependent on DNA homology, force the two  DNA end to connect together,which is called  non-homologous end joining.  This mechanism allows the possibility that displacement vector is randomly inserted  into chromosomes, greatly reducing the efficiency of homologous recombination.
