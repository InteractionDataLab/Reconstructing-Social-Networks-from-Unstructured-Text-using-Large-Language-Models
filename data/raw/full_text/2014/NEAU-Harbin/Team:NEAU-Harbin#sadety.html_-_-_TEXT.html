Q1:Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, and environmental safety?
A: Our researchers under the danger of the experimental material has accepted the lab safety training before  entering  the laboratory ,  and they will practice protective measures in the process of experimental operation, when they must in touch with toxic matrials they would wear plastic gloves and mouth-muffle or some other safeguard procedures. Once we finished our experiment, all wares we used would be sterilized in high temperature, then we would discard waste in waste bins designated for our iGEM lab, and we would wear gloves when we washed wares.
Our biological materials mainly escherichia coli, agrobacterium and Aspergillus niger, they are widely used in the laboratory, under certain conditions they can cultivate a large number of growth, after the test we will take high temperature sterilization method to get rid of them, then we won`t let them into the environment, so we will not bring impact to public safety,and environmental safety
Q2:Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
A:We have the biosafety committee in our university. Mr. Lei Yu is the biosafety officer. We have discussed our project with him. He said that our project can be performed in microbiology lab of college of life science. He emphasized that we must follow the rules of "Safety in the Biology Laboratory of NEAU". He recommended that we should correctly dispose biodisposals, such as bactrial and Aspergillus niger cells.
Q3: Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices
and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
A:We suggest that IGEM should establish a filter system from a known database,so it can decrease the utilization of genes that are highly dangerous.And IGEM should have their own inspection department which can make regualar check-ups.Lectures regarding biosafety are also encouraged in IGEM Jamboree.
