Jie Li is an associate professor in Life Science College of NEAU. He is the major instructor of our team. His speciality is genetic engineering of filamentous fungi. He has engaged in genetic engineering for about twenty years and is attracted greatly by synthetic biology for its engineering idea and powerful tools. He helped us to design and perform the experiments. He loves our team!
Jing Cang is a professor in Life Science College of NEAU. Her currently research is about the molecular mechanism of cold resistance in winter wheat. She is the person in charge of NSFC project of scientific training for undergraduates, which is the main funding of our team.
Fang Gao is a the vice director in Life Science College of NEAU. He is in charge of management work of the whole team. As the boys and girls, he feels the iGEM competition challenging and exciting and will enjoy the Giant Jamboree very much!
Jing Li is a professor in Life Science College of NEAU. Her research focuses on plant secondary metabolites. She primarily provided support on English writing and gave us a lot of suggestion in preparation of presentation and posters.
Xi Bai is an associate professor in Life Science College of NEAU. He is an expert of bioinformatics and his current research is about the mechanisms of drought in Arabidopsis and soybean. He instructed us in doing experiments and we really got smart ideas from him.
Wei Ji is an associate professor in Life Science College of NEAU. Her major is plant molecular biology. The new and rapidly expanding field of synthetic biology attracts her a lot. iGEM is a good chance for Wei to learn and get in touch with the application of synthetic biology. As a young researcher, she hopes to make her scientific dream come true together with her lovely students. Go iGEMers!
