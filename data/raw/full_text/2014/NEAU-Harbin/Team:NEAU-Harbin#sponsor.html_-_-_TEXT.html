Visits to the pharmaceutical industrial companies
In order to shorten the distance from the academic research to application, we visited two pharmaceutical industrial companies this summer.In Harbin Pharmaceutical Factory, we discussed with chemists about how to introduce the concept of synthetic biology into new medicine exploitation. We also listen to their opinions about application of our project and discuss this issue with them. In jiangshi Pharmaceutical Industrial company, the manager showed us around the factory, andg gave us some suggestions to our project which made us more confident, and we all knew that there were quite a lot of things we should do in the future.
