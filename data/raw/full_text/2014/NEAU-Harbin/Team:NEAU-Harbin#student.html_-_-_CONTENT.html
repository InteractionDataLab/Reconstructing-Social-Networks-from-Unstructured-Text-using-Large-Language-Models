We all study in Northeast Agriculture University, and most of us are the juniors, except one girl who is still a sophomore. Though this is our first time to take part in the iGEM competition, we really have a long-time preparation since last year. There are 6 groups in our team:experiment group, artwork group, poster group, wiki group, human practice group, modeling group. Having the same goal makes us be more unite and makes the whole process joyful.  We all enjoy the process so much and we love the iGEM!! </P><P>My name is Kang Yang, the leader of our team. I took part in 2013 iGEM and introduced it to my classmates and build this team. As a leader, I not only worked very hard on experiments but also have to make sure that everything needed has been done before deadline. These works are tough but I enjoy it. It is my responsibility to make our team goes well.</P><P>My name is Hanrong Feng. I major in bioscience and this year I'm already a junior in NEAU. As the leader of our wiki team, I put all my heart in wiki-making. Also, I participated in the design of poster and dealt with the social affairs. iGEM not only gives us a good chance to learn more knowledge and do more experiments, but also make us attack problems with enthusiasm! I love iGEM! I love my team!</P><P>Hi, my name is Hao Sun. Most of my time was used to prepare presentation, wiki and poster, as well as brainstorming. I am an outgoing boy, usually has passion on making jokes. It’s my pleasure to bring lots of joy to my teammates during experiments. In my spare time, I like playing basketball. Of course, I am a fan of the Boston Celtics. Looking forward to make friends with you!</P><P>I'm Anji Ju, a member of NEAU-Harbin, who is responsible for the experiments. I'm interested in synthetic biology. The engineering idea attracted me to join our team. I constructed the expression vector and transform it into A. niger, which seemed very cool. Solving problems in lab makes me feel good and I'm very confident that I do play an important role in our team!</P><P>My name is Qiang Guo, my major is biology science. In our team, I worked on the section of genetic engineering of carteniods metabolic pathway through our visual gene replacement system. Besides, I also participate in the work of designing webpage and recording experiment results. I believe that “no pains, no gains”. I am such a boy who always tries his best to pursue his dream and enjoy the colorful life. I believe the efforts we paid will finally be rewarded.</P><P>I am Yumeng Wu and I major in biology science. I was a freshman of NEAU when I first touch iGEM. The past year is very important to me because I am growing up together with our team, and now I am a sophomore. I belong to the art and designing group. It is my first time to take part in this competition. Good luck to NEAU-Harbin!</P><P>My name is Yong Han, a member of the team NEAU-Harbin. This is my first time to participate in the iGEM competition. In our team, I am mainly responsible for human practice and art designing. And I also do some experiments. For me the most important thing is to try my best. I really enjoy being together with a group of perfect teammates.</P><P>I am Xinyu Ning, 21 years old, major in bioengineering. This is the beginning of my third year in our university. In our team I mainly worked in the part of human practice and experiments. I am interested in synthetic biology and learned some basic principles from the library, and always discuss with my classmates and friends. I am lucky to join the team NEAU-Harbin, which made up of the students who have the same interest to apply the knowledge of synthetic biology. It was an impressive and wonderful summer in my campus life.</P><P>I'm Yan Shi from NEAU, my major is life science. I like to swim in the ocean of the biological knowledge. In my spare time I like to learn mathematical modeling, I prefer to use mathematics to solve biological problems. I want to learn bioinformatics in the near future.</P><P>I am Daoyu Zhang. Though I am a little bit shy, I like making friends with all kinds of people. I worked on human practice in our team. Now I understand better and really believe the saying “Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish.”</P><P>I’m Xiaolei Zhang, a girl who likes painting very much. My role in our team is designing logo and wiki. Besides, I also participated in doing experiments sometimes. I love our team, I love IGEM!</P><P>My name is Kai Zhang. I major in Biotechnology and this year I'm already a junior in NEAU. I put all my heart in doing experiment and I really enjoy it. My teammates support me a lot. I love IGEM!</P><P>My name is Yanxu Lau, come from Heilongjiang Province, China. I'm a fat boy. I think I need to keep on diet but it's really hard. My major is biological science.My motto is: Curiosity is your best teacher.</P><P>My name is Yuelun Wang, I devote myself to design wiki and solve the team's daily matters segments. We met lots of obstacles from the team built, but I believe it's the passion, dedication and struggle that make us stronger.
