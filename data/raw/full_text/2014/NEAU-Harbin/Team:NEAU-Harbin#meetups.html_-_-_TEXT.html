Communication with schoolmates
Since it is the first time for us to participate in iGEM, we shared our excitements and plans with our schoolmates and the faculty of Life Science College. We made a presentation and carefully introduced iGEM and some wonderful previous iGEM projects. People are deeply attracted by the beauty of synthetic biology and the fantastic ideas of some iGEM projects. We had energetic discussion and obtained a lot of valuable suggestions and inspirations.
Meetup with high school students
On July 13th 2014, Heilongjiang Province Summer Camp of Science for High School Students was held in our university. 79 high school students from different area of Heilongjiang province participated in this Camp. Taking advantages of this opportunity, we gave a lecture “Synthetic biology and iGEM” and had a spirited discussion with those senior high school students. Some of these children showed great interests in the iGEM competition. Encouraged by our team members, the children decided to found their own team and try to learn more about synthetic biology. They would very much like to join in the iGEM in the near future.
Interaction with other iGEMers
We attended the conference held by National Chiao Tung University August 3-7 2014 and  communicated with iGEM teams from Tsinghua University, Fudan University ect. to share our experiences and thoughts. We discussed key points of wiki design, presentation preparation and poster making. We did get a lot of valuable suggestions from these experienced iGEM teams!
Participation in "Biological Big Bytes" Workshop
The workshop on Biological Big Bytes (B3) is a satellite meeting of the traditional annual international workshop on “Crops, Chips and Computers” (C3), aiming to teach best practice in the application of state-of-the-art information technology and computational techniques to big data research in life sciences.  This workshop is held in Harbin Institute of Technology. In the “iGEM Meetup” section, we shared our project idea and current progress with teams of Northeast Forestry University and Harbin Institute of Technology. We got great suggestions from Professor DengChang Xu and Professor Ming Chen.
