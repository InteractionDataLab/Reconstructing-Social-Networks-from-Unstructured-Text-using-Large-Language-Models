OUR PRODUCT
Overview
Biophrame Technologies is committed to be one of the most innovative high biotech companies in Mexico, providing quality and affordable raw materials that can help the development of the health industry in Mexico.
Initially we are going to focus on producing Chitosan (see image below) with pharmaceutical grade to be used as raw material in health industry; however, thanks to the enormous uses Chitosan has in many industries, our production process provides significant opportunities to expand our market beyond, through the development of new products where Chitosan provides added value.
Chitosan definition, applications and properties
Chitosan is a biopolymer derived from chitin (a naturally occurring polysaccharide widely distributed in nature, especially exoskeletons of some animals such as shrimps and insects) with a unique chemical structure as a linear polycation with a high charge density, hydrogen bonding, reactive hydroxyl and amino groups that help Chitosan display excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, physical stability, hemostatic activity and processability properties, which has attracted the attention of scientists and industries for its utilization in many applications of technical interest (Raafat & Sahl, 2009).
Chemically, Chitosan is a copolymer composed by β-(1→4)-2-acetamido-D-glucose and β-(1→4)-2-amino-D-glucose units (see figure below), where the relative amount of GlcNAc and D‐glucosamine (GlcN) monosacharides may vary giving different degrees of deacetylation (75–95%), molecular weights (MWs) (50–2000 kDa), viscosities, pKa values, etc (Raafat & Sahl, 2009).

Safety of Purified Chitosan
The safety of purified chitosan has been widely reported in humans (Decarlo, Ellis, Dooley, & Belousova, 2013), for example:
The purified Chitosan is present, as a secondary and principal component, in multiple US FDA-approved Class I medical and dental devices. For example,  it can be found in HemCon Bandage, HemCon Dental Dressing, HemoHalt Hemostasis Pad Wound Dressing, CELOX Topical Hemostatic Granules in Soluble Bag, and ChitoGauze (Decarlo, Ellis, Dooley, & Belousova, 2013).
Purified Chitosan is considered as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) Food Additive at the level of “self-affirmed” (Decarlo, Ellis, Dooley, & Belousova, 2013).
Chitosan, its salt forms (like lactate, glycolate, ascorbate, etc.) and some of its organic derivatives are listed among the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI). It is important to mention that Chitosan has not yet been evaluated by the Cosmetics Ingredients Review (CIR); however, it is considered by the scientific community as safe raw material for skincare and cosmetic products (Decarlo, Ellis, Dooley, & Belousova, 2013).
First Generation Product
The first generation product of Biophrame Technologies will be a 100 g powder presentation of low and medium purity Chitosan (75-85% deacetylated/ Medium molecular weight), with standard chemical and physical properties to be used mainly in:
Pharmaceutical industry (Tablet, gel and membrane manufacturing)
Cosmetic products (deodorant formulations and hair and skin care products)
Food industry (as dietary supplements)
Also, as we discovered throw our marketing research with some mexican pharmaceutical industries, some of which are interested in our product, (see human practice and marketing sections), there is a need of bigger presentations; that is why we also offer a 10 kg presentation.
Future Generation Products
In the future, Biophrame Technologies expect to amplify its production plant for the generation of a new product: High Purity Chitosan (Degree of deacetylation: 90-99 %). This product will be sold in 1 g presentation with standard chemical and physical properties to be used in:
The pharmaceutical industry for new product development:
Pills and microsphere manufacture
Oral vaccination
Artificial skin drafts
Sustained drug release, among many others
Research purposes like
Cell therapy
Tissue engineering
Wound dressings
Implant coatings
Therapeutic agent delivery systems, among others
As in the case of medium-low purity chitosan, some pharmaceutical companies and research centers in Mexico are interested in our product, however some of them buy 1g presentation for research purposes while others 10kg presentation (mainly for pharmaceutic preparations); therefore, we will offer both of them to satisfy the customer desires.
Biophrame Technologies is a biotech company and manufacturer specialized in the production of Chitosan.
