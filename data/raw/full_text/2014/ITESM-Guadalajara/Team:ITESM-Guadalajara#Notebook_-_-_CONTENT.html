We started the formation of our multidisciplinary iGEM team to make possible our project idea of a biotechnological company “Biopharma Technologies”; however, at the beginning, we were a team of only biotechnological and biomedical engineers.
 </P><P>From April 15 to 20: <B>Fundraise</B><UL><LI>	We started to fundraising for our Giant Jamboree trip, through snacks selling in our University and at some Congresses like the Biotechnology Engineering Congress.
</LI><LI>	At the same time, all the team was working in the company vision and goals.  </LI></UL></P><P>
Date: April 23
Event: Biotechnology Engineering Congress
Members: Sofia Arreola, Rodolfo Valdés, Daniel Flores, Lizeth Sánchez
</P><P>
We attended this event organized by our University (ITESM) to speak with other biotechnology engineers about our project idea and to sell some snacks that would help us to fundraise our trip to Boston.
</P><H3>May 2014</H3><P>
May 14: <B>Synthetic Biology’s Seminar</B>. 
We created a Synthetic Biology's Seminary with our Technical Advisor PhD. María José Rivas to learn about the advances, techniques, definitions, and to choose and evaluate the first Biophrame Project, with which we would be participating on iGEM.
</P><P>
May 14 to May 20: <B>Project ideas</B>
Our team met to propose ideas of possible iGEM first products/projects. In this meeting we realized that we needed to search people from other disciplines, such as Finances and Administration, in order to make &quot;Biophrame Technologies&quot; an integrative team.
</P><P>
May 22 to May 30: <B>Growing up the team!</B><UL><LI>	We were glad to integrate Carolina Salazar, Itzel Milanés, Sergio Nuñez and Jorge Parra to Biophrame's team, our experts in Finance, Administration, Image and Marketing.
</LI><LI>	With our new team members and advisors, we chose the &quot;Non Chemical Chitosan Production Process&quot; as the first Biopharme's product, because it was short term achievable, financially attractive, ecological, technically simple and over all socially relevant.
</LI><LI>	We started the division of task in order to develop the technical and financial dimensions of the project; so, at first we had only the financial and technical division divisions. </LI></UL></P><H3>June 2014</H3><P>
June 14: <B>CONACYT (Science and Technology National Council) visit</B>
We visited this governmental organization to look for financial support, but there were no open founding options applying to our project.
</P><P>June 14: <B>Bio Zoo pharmaceutical Visit</B>
We visit the Bio Zoo company in order to speak about our business idea and to look for the possibility to form an alliance as company-clients. In our interviews they showed a real interest in being potential clients of Biophrame
</P><P>
From June 15 to June 30: <B>Technical Strategy design</B><UL><LI>	We investigate all the technical possibilities to produce Chitosan without the use of chemical substances and using as raw material wastes generated from other industries in Mexico. 
</LI><LI>	We chose the best biotechnological option and we started the detailed design of the process. We could not start the experimentation process in a parallel way to our investigations and technical advances because we didn't have our iGEM kit due to customs problems.</LI></UL></P><H3>August 2014</H3><P>August 1: <B>BBQ organization</B>
We started the organization of our special BBQ. We organized this event in order to raise funds. 
</P><P>
From August 1 to September 20: <B>Pilot plant design and business plan development</B><UL><LI>	We designed our pilot plant in two stages: 1) Experimental phase and 2) Final pilot plant.
</LI><LI>	We researched the temperature, calculated the volumes needed in each bioreactor and calculated the approximate time the process will require in each phase of the process.
</LI><LI>At the same time, the financial and marketing division was developing all the relevant parts of the business plan. </LI></UL></P><P>
August 14: <B>Café con ciencia (special event for biotech students at ITESM, Campus Guadalajara)</B>
Members: Sofia Arreola, Lizeth Sánchez
We went to this special event to talk about iGEM and to invite all the biotech students to be involved in our mission: the creation of a biotech company for biotech engineers, where they can CREATE processes.
 </P><P>
August 14: <B>Skyping with other teams.</B>
We wanted to know other teams and their projects; so, from this date on, we skyped with the teams: “Tec Monterrey”, “Zamorano” and “BIOSINT_Mexico”.
