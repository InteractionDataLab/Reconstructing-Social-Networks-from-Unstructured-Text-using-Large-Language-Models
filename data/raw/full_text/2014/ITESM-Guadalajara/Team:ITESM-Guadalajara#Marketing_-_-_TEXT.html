Brand and Pricing Strategy
Biophrame’s flagship product is BioK, which is going to be sold in two presentations: medium-low purity and high purity Chitosan.
Our pricing strategy consists in introducing the product at lower prices. BioK medium purity will be sold at $115 USD per bottle of 100 g. On the other hand, BioK high purity will be sold at $23 USD for bag of 1 g.
Chitosan market prices for medium purity Chitosan is on average $1.15 USD per gram and $23 USD per gram for high purity Chitosan, which places our prices lower than the market average. We expect to increase the price once we increase the customer awareness and our market share. During our go-to-market period, our market share for medium purity Chitosan will be of 2.17% for phase 1 and 4.71% phase 2.
