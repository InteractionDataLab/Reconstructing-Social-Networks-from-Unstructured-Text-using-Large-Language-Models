The type of organizational chart for Biophram Technologies during the first years of operations will be “functional”, this because at the beginning the company will be small, not too many personnel is required, just two products (medium-low purity quitosan and high purity quitosan) will be processed in the plant for the short-term and both have quite similar needs, also the production and sales will be done mostly at the national level (export plans after de second year).
</P><P align="justify">
Two main benefits we will have with this organization type are the specialization (each worker will focus on the main activities in which he/she is involved so better results could be obtained thanks to all the experience and expertise of each); and productivity (because they have a wide knowledge in a particular area and they could do their tasks in less time, increasing results speed).  
</P><P align="justify">
Something really important for us is the teamwork; this is why a primary task for our administrative assistants will be to promote collaboration and communication between departments during office hours and after them, such as organizing special recreational activities (sports, arts, lunch time, etc.)
</P><P align="justify">
For the medium and long term, probably the best way to organize the company will be through a “project management organizational chart”, this because as time goes by and thanks to the research and development activities of the company, different products/projects will be developed, each one with its own particularities.
</P><P align="justify">
The following document is an example of the job description for the Chief Financial Officer position. This document is needed whenever a new employee occupies the position, as well for the current CFO worker is important because by this means he/she will have clear the duties and tasks that have to be done, what is expected from the job and the aspects considered for evaluating and compensating the position.

Both compensation and benefits are a crucial aspect for employee satisfaction, retention and remuneration.

The associates of Biophrame will have the majority of the shares (at least a 51 percent), this to have a better control and management of the company’s operation. To be an attractive option for external investors, the proportion of ownership that could be offered would be 30%(investors)-70%(Biophrame founders).</P><P align="justify">
The division  of the  ownership percentage of Biophrame between the founders haven’t been defined clearly, this because we don’t know surely how much money does each of us would invest, nevertheless, if a 70% is owned by us, the division of shares will be fairly distributed, like in  the following list:
</P><P>
Lizette  Sánchez López 7.77%
Rodolfo Valdés  7.77%
Lizette A. Reyes 7.77%
Itzel Milanés 7.77%
Ana Sofia Arreola  7.77%
Carolina Salazar 7.77%
Jorge  Parra 7.77%
Sergio Nuñez 7.77%
Daniel Flores 7.77%</P><H4>	Board of directors.</H4><P align="justify">
Because it is crucial to have a good control of the daily operations, as well as clear future plans and detailed strategies for the company, the members of the board of directors play an important role in Biophrame. All these people will be giving a global perspective of the issues that will happen and how to act in advance.
</P><P align="justify">
At the beginning, because it will be a small company, with few employees, the board of directors will be made up of 10 people maximum (this won´t be a problem because for the first year we will be nine workers),but as soon as Biophrame starts growing we will try to remain a small group (mostly 15 people). That way it will be easier to agree meeting in a particular date, and decision taking could be done efficiently and effectively.
</P><P align="justify">
The nine people that will be in the board during the first years will be the functional officers of the company (CEO, CFI, CMO, CTO, etc.), this means that just internal members will be part of it.
</P><P align="justify">
For the medium-term, and with the purpose to have impartiality over the topics and decisions, some external members will be included, for example: business/engineer consultants, an important client such as pharmaceutical, investors, maim supplier. As it is mentioned above, 15 will be the maximum number of members for the board, probably not all of the company officers could be part of it, so this is why the same managers will nominee to the ten officers that will be there.
 </P><P align="justify">
We will try to have meetings every two weeks or once a month during the first year (more often), and as Biophrame grows these could be done every two or three months.
