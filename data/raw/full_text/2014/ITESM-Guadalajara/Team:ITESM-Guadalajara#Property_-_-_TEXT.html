Given the high-end technology and innovation Biophrame is creating, IP protection is needed.
Patent protection and trade secrets
The technology that we developed consists in:
The design of a genetically modified E. coli, that in our process is the responsible of the chitin deacetylation process.
We are currently patenting our first invention: the design of the genetically modified E. coli able to deacetylate chitin to produce Chitosan. We started the technology research at the IMPI (Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property), on September 17 (official documents available upon request), and we will start the patent process on January of 2015 in order to apply to government funds. The patent will be registered under the name of Biophrame Technologies as moral person (once it is legally established).
On the other hand, we will keep our innovative chitosan purification process as a trade secret, but we plan to establish a patent for this invention in other step of our Company development.
Biophrame Technologies is a biotech company and manufacturer specialized in the production of Chitosan.
