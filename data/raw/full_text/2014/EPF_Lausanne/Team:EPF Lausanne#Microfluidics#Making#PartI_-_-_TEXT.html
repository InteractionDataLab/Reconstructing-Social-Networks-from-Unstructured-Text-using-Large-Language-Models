Introduction to photolithography
The following processes will explain how a mask and a positive/negative resist wafer are made. These two components are essential for the creation of our chips, as they are the master plan, the mold for the chip. This is how it works: a mask is used as a mold to make a wafer, and a wafer is used as a mold to make each of the microfluidic chip's layers (control and flow layers).
Mask
Wafers
Here are defined the two main types of photoresist. A photoresist is a light-sensitive material used in several industrial processes, such as photolithography and photoengraving to form a patterned coating on a surface:
- A negative resist is a type of photoresist in which the portion of the photoresist that is exposed to light crosslinks and thus becomes insoluble to the photoresist developer. The unexposed portion of the photoresist is dissolved by the photoresist developer.
- A positive resist is a type of photoresist in which the portion of the photoresist that is exposed to light becomes soluble to the photoresist developer. The portion of the photoresist that is unexposed remains insoluble to the photoresist developer.

Cross section of a photolithography mask
2
Laser exposure
Heidelberg DWL200, Laser lithography system
The laser beams on the surface of the photoresist. By doing so, it imprints the pattern of the design on the PR.
3
Developing of the mask
DV10 Mask and Thick positive resist developer
A chemical treatment is used to  remove the PR that was exposed by the laser in the previous step, creating the ‘holes’ on the photoresist
4
Etching of the chrome
Coillard Gravure
The chrome is removed at the sites where the resist layer is missing, using an acid bath.
5
Removal of Resist
Coillard Photolithographie
Once the chrome is removed at the precise sites (previous step), the rest of the resist is removed from the whole surface.
6
Use of mask
The mask can now be used to expose its pattern on the wafer using UV light

Cross-section after process
1
Substrate: Wafer Clean
Tepla 300
Clean the wafer using plasma treatment
2
Photolith: Resist deposition       Photo Resist : Su8 GM1070 – 30μm
Sawatec
A layer of negative photoresist is added on the wafer by spincoating
3
Relaxation time + Softbake
Sawatec
Softbake wafer using Sawatec hotplate, to solidify the photo resist
4
Photolith:UV exposure
Mask Aligner
The UV lights are exposed through the Mask on the surface of the wafer. By doing so, it imprints the pattern of the design on the PR.
5
Post exposure bake
Sawatec
Bake wafer using Sawatec hotplate
6
Relaxation delay
Wait 1 hour – overnight
7
Photolith: Develop
Wetbench plane solvent
This removes the unexposed photoresist from the wafer using chemical treatment on a wet bench
8
Hard bake
DataPlate
Bake 135°C 2 hours, using an oven
