Agarose Gel Preparation
Materials
TAE 1X
Agarose
GelRed
Procedure
For a 1.2 % agarose gel (small fragments), put 0.6 grams of agarose into 50 mL of TAE 1X. For a 3 % agarose gel (big fragments), put 1.5 g of agarose into 50 mL of TAE 1X.
Warm the solution in the microwave (max. Power) for 30 seconds, or until agarose has melted.
Mix the solution.
Add 1.3uL of Gel Red (1.5 for 3 % gel).
Pour the solution into an agarose gel mold including the comb.
Wait 20 min for the gel to solidify.
Place the gel in TAE 1X and remove comb.
Mix ~200ng of DNA with nuclease free water and loading buffer to a final 1X concentration (total volume of 12uL).
Run the gel for 45 min at 100 Volts (more time if needed). For a 3 % gel, run for 2 hours at 80 Volts.
Take a picture of the gel at the UV detector.

Miniprep – with QlAprep Spin Miniprep kit
Materials
Ovenight liquid cell cultures (5-8 mL)
QlAprep Spin Miniprep kit
Procedure
Pellet bacterial cells from overnight 5-8 mL culture (4000 rpm, 10 min) and discard the medium.
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 μL Buffer P1 (stored at 4°C). Ensure that RNase A has been added to Buffer P1. No cells clumps should be visible after resuspension of the pellet. Transfer the resuspended cells into a 1.5 microcentrifuge tube.
Add 250 μL Buffer P2 and gently invert the tube 4-6 times to mix (do not vortex). If necessary, continue inverting the tube until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear. Let stand for 2-4 minutes; never more than 5.
Add 350 μL Buffer N3 and invert the tube immediately but gently 4-6 times. The solution should become cloudy.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in a table-top microcentrifuge. A compact pellet will form.
Apply the supernatant from step 5 to the QlAprep Spin Column by pipetting.
Centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm. Discard the flow-through.
Wash QlAprep Spin Column by adding 750 μL Buffer PE and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.
Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer.
Place the QlAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50 μL Buffer EP (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) to the center of each QlAprep Spin Column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min at 13,000 rpm.

* Due to the difficulties in pipetting small volumes of enzyme, Taq DNA Polymerase can be diluted in 1X reaction buffer. For example, 1 µl of Taq DNA Polymerase is mixed with 4 µl of 1X reaction buffer and 1 µl of that mixture is added to the reaction. Enzyme diluted 1X reaction buffer should not be stored for future use.
Gently mix the reaction and spin down in microcentrifuge. If the thermocycler does not have a heated cover, add one drop of mineral oil to the reaction tube to prevent evaporation.

Procedure
Place a stirrer bar in a 2 liters Erlenmeyers
Add 2.6g amino acid powder, 3.4g yeast nitrogen base, 10g ammonium sulphate, adenine sulphate(+/- 1g) and 950mL water.
adjust pH to 5.9 by adding a few drops of 10 M NaOH
In a new erlenmeyer, add 35g agar and 900 ml water
Autoclave the 2 flasks

Cool to 55°C
Before pouring add 100ml 40% glucose (in 2l final)
before pouring add 16ml* of the required amino acids (in 2L final)
Pour plates
Thermocompetent E. coli cells preparation
Materials
Bacterial colony from plate (day 1)
LB medium (day 1)
DMSO (day 2)
Liquid nitrogen (day 2)
Sterile Inoue buffer (day 2) – for buffer preparation, see below
Note: the 250 mL of culture can be separated after growth into smaller tubes (for example, to facilitate centrifugation at 4 ºC). Make sure to respect the proportion of all added buffers and solutions.
Procedure
Pick a single colony from a plate that has been incubated overnight at 37 ºC.
Transfer the colony into 30 mL of LB in a 250 mL flask.
Use this starter culture to inoculate three 1-liter flasks with 1 mL of starter culture, each containing 250 mL of LB (there’s no need to make triplicates, one flask is enough to get 100-120 x 200 µL tubes).
Incubate flasks overnight (depends on growth, 8-17 hours) at 22 ºC (room temperature) with shaking at 180 rpm.
Monitor the OD600 (every 45 min) until it reaches 0.55, and transfer the culture on ice for 10 min. It is important to stop growth at 0.55, can be longer than 10 min on ice.
Centrifuge the cells at 2500 g for 10 min at 4 ºC (temperature is important, it’s better if you can do the rest of the protocol in a cold room).
Pour off the medium and remove any remaining drop.
Resuspend cells gently in 240 mL of ice-cold Inoue buffer (0 ºC).
Repeat steps 6 to 8, using only 60 mL of ice-cold Inoue buffer for the resuspention.
Add 4.5 mL of DMSO and store on ice for 10 min.
Dispense 200 µL aliquots of the suspension into sterile microtubes.
Put the tubes in a container and snap-freeze them by pouring liquid nitrogen on them. It is important to pour the liquid nitrogen on them, as they have to freeze very fast; the aliquots are best when small for the same reason.
Store the tubes at -80 ºC until needed. Note: thaw on ice when used.

Materials
DNA
Competent cells
SOC medium (SOB + Glucose) - room temperature
Petri dish with antibiotic resistance - 37 ºC
Procedure
Thaw competent cells on ice.
Chill 5 ng of ligation mixture in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and then add 50 µL of competent cells. Do not vortex or mix.
Place the mixture on ice for 30 min (do not mix).
Heat-shock cells at 42 ºC for 30 s in a pre-heated water bath (works better than on a heating block) (do not mix).
Place on ice and add 950 µL of room temperature SOC medium to the tube (make sure that it is not contaminated).
Place tube at 37 ºC for 60 min. Shake or rotate (250 rpm). Warm selection plates to 37 ºC (not necessary, but increases efficiency).
Spread 50-100 µL of samples on plates (dependent on efficiency of the competent cells); incubate overnight at 37 ºC.

DNA
Competent cells
SOC medium (SOB + Glucose)
Petri dish with antibiotic resistance
Procedure
Thaw competent cells on ice.
Add 50 µL of thawed competent cells into a pre-chilled 2 mL tube.
Add 5 ng of resuspended DNA to the sample and pipet gently up and down a few times.
Keep the sample on ice for 30 min.
Heat-shock cells at 42 ºC for 60 s in a pre-heated water bath (works better than on a heating block).
Place samples on ice for 5 min (can be more).
Add 200 µL of SOC medium to the sample (make sure that it is not contaminated).
Incubate cells at 37 ºC for 2 hours with shaking or rotating. 2 hours recovery time after incubation helps in transformation efficiency.
Plate 20 µL and 200 µL of the sample on two plates and spread.
Incubate the plates at 37 ºC for 12-14 hours (agar side of the plate has to be up). Note: Incubating for too long will increase the occurrence of satellite colonies (especially if resistant to Ampicillin).
