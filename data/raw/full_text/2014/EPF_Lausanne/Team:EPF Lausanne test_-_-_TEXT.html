The Bio Pad Project
This year’s EPFL iGEM team is designing the world’s first “Bio Pad”: a biological trackpad that will allow users to control a computer via a “living” interface.
Our project aims to deliver a solid Proof of Concept for biological track pad, with applications ranging from the study of genes to novel ways to screen for drugs.
Touch Pad
Our Touch Pad will be the first biological track pad. The pad itself will need nothing else than a little water and nutriments to be operational. The EPFL Bio touch pad aims to be a proof of concept for the introduction of biological components in engineering. As such, futuristic applications of this technology include a substitute to “traditional” touch pads. This could have an economic and ecological impact as indium oxide, the main component of today’s touch screens, is being rapidly depleted (some estimate depletion by 2030).
Drug Screening
One of the applications of the EPFL Bio Touch pad is drug screening. This is because  it could allow researchers to track the activation of certain pathways by luminescence.  Thanks to our light detection and localization system, researchers could screen small  molecule libraries in a fast, fully automated, and cheap way. We could apply this concept to find molecules that could affect the biological pathway used for our Bio Pad  project.
