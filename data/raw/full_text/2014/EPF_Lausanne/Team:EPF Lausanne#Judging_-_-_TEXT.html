Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
Attributions
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.

iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.

iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM).

Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
Demonstrate the implementation of any fluidic system. Document via video, images, and text how you fabricated and tested any milli-, micro- or nano-fluidic system.
Making a chip
Document and submit your fluidic system to the "Metafluidics" repository of device and hardware designs.
Microfluidic designs
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.
Safety Page
Metafluidics Page
Demonstrate the implementation of a novel fluidic system. This system can be a variation of an existing published system, with novel areas including optimized device geometries, integration of different functional modules (e.g. on-chip mixer and incubator), improved "world-to-chip" interfaces, improved controller hardware, or software.
Novel fluidic system
Utilizing any fluidic system, characterize a new BioBrick Part or Device. Document any biological protocols performed utilizing your microfluidic system. Compare biological protocols conducted on-chip against standard bench top techniques. Upload data collected to the page of the part(s) used on the Registry of Standard Biological Parts via experience page/contribution system.
