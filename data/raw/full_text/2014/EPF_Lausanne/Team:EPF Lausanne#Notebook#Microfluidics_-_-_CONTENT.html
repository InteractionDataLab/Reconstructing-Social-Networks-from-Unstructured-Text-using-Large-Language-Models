After an overnight culture of these bacteria in LB medium containing chloramphenicol they were flown in the chip and subsequently scanned after stressing the bacteria.</P><P>CpxR is synthetised upon membrane stress (see our Cpx pathway description for more informations). The idea here was to stress bacteria by applying pressure on them in order to make the bacteria produce their Cpxr protein and thus inducing RFP synthesis. In the biobrick we used (BBa_K339007), there is a CpxR protein sensor upstream of the RFP coding sequence.

The culture was incubated at 37°C with shaking at 180 rpm. The following day the overnight culture was diluted 1:100 in 5ml fresh LB + chloramphenicol and grown for 4 hours at 37° C on a rotary shaker to reach an OD of ~0.6.</P><P>1.8 ml of the culture was then diluted in 1.2 ml arabinose 20% (final concentration of 8%) and grown for 2 more hours. 1 μl of biliverdin hydrochloride 25 mM in DMSO was added and thoroughly mixed until homogenization. The culture was grown for 4 more hours, then centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in either 320μL PBS or 320μL PBS + 80 mM KCl and aliquoted into a white 96-well plate in triplicates.</P><P>Once the difference in intensity between stressed and non-stressed cells on the plate reader was high enough, cells of each batch were taken from one well and transferred on the microfluidic chip as shown below.</P><P>Cells were scanned after 20 min using a Cy5 filter.</P><P><STRONG>Results</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Data</STRONG></P><P> </P><P>Cy5 scan of a chamber containing non stressed IFP-neg bacteria</P><P>Cy5 scan of a chamber containing KCl-stressed IFP-neg bacteria</P><P> </P><P>Cy5 scan of a chamber containing non stressed CpxR-IFP bacteria</P><P>Cy5 scan of a chamber containing KCl-stressed CpxR-IFP bacteria</P><P>The ratio of fluorescent cells was calculated on 5 chambers for each batch using ImageJ (the total number of cells was measured on brightfield images).
