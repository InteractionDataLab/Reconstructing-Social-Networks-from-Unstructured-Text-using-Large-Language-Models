Raspberry Pi
2014-07-17
The Raspberry Pi is a cheap (40.-) and small single-board computer that we are going to use in order to monitor the light in each of the chambers of the microfluidic chip.
In order to track the light we need a good camera that is cheap and allows us to be flexible.
We chose the Raspberry Pi NoIR, NoIR stands for No Infrared Filter meaning that with this camera we are able to see near infrared wavelength.
 
Near infrared correspond to wavelength between 700 and 1000nm we will use this feature of the camera with the IFP.

Light tracking
2014-10-15
In order to view the light change in a chamber we need to track the light intensity.
For this part we made a custom C++ code using OpenCV (you can find the entire code there  https://github.com/arthurgiroux/igemtracking/ )
 
 
 Here's the result output:
 
 
 
The most common color space that program uses is RGB where the pixel color can be split into three components Red, Green and Blue with values between 0 and 255.
 
But there exists a lot of other color space that can be used for different applications, in our case we are interested in light intensity and not really in colors.
 
In our code we use the YCrCb color space, it decomposes a pixel into three components Y: the luma value (the intensity), Cr is the red difference and Cb is the blue difference.

Lenses
2014-11-13
The Raspberry Pi camera that we use has a fixed lense that is not really suitable for our use because we can't change the focus, the aperture or the zoom.
We searched for a way to change the lense and have the more control possible on it and we found that the easiest way was to remove the initial lense, put a CS mount on it and attach a much bigger lense.
We found some cheap lense online (~45$) and we did the mounting.
 
The first thing is to unplug the camera module from the PCB, once it's done you need to remove the lense carefully by unscrewing it.
You will then see the camera detector.
 
You can then screw the CS mount on the board and plug the lense in.
