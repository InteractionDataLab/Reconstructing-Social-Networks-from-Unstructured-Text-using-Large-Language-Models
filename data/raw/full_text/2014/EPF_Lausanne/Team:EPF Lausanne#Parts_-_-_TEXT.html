Microfluidics parts (chips created)
Our team designed and made 4 microfluidic chips. At the beginning, we also used the MITOMI chip .
When designing the chips, the team took into account the future users and the current iGEM classification of parts. We considered it best to construct our chips as composite microfluidic parts, so their sub-parts could be used and combined in multiple ways. The flow and control layers can be separated and reused, as well as all the basic structures (chamber + connecting channel), nodes, array parts,...
By clicking on each of the designs' name, you can download the original files.
Name
Main Function
SmashColi
To be able to separate the chip in 4 different compartments and apply 4 different pressures on each row of chambers.
The BioPad
A large and simple microfluidic chip containing 6400 chambers in which the cells are contained in. Each chamber acts as a pixel for the BioPad project.
CleanColi
As a result of our Safety page, we decided to create a chip that is able to seal the bacteria in the chip, preventing them to leave the chip.
FilterColi
To successfully immerse cells in a certain solution, this chip was designed to flow in the new medium in the chambers instead of doing it by diffusion.
