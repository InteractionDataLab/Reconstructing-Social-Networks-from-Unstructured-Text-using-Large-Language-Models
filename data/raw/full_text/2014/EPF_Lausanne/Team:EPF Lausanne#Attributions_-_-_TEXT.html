The project's experiments were all conducted by the student members of the 2014 iGEM EPFL team . To better tackle each part of the project, we divided the team in small groups. These groups evolved throughout the project depending of the needs for each experiment.
The design & characterisation of the CpxR stress-sensitive response in E. coli was done by Ted Baldwin, Cécile Piot and Nikolaus Huwiler.
The design & characterisation of the full and split luciferases in E. coli was done by Sakura Nussbaum, Lucie Petetin, Grégoire Repond and Thomas Simonet.
The design & characterisation of the arabinose promoter was done by Lucie Petetin and Ione Pla.
The design & characterisation of the HOG osmo response in S. cerevisiae was done by Romane Breysse, Jin Chang and Bastien Duckert.
The design, fabrication and tests of the different microfluidic chips were done by Axel de Tonnac, Grégoire Repond and Thomas Simonet.
The signal detection and processing with the Raspberry Pi was implemented by Arthur Giroux.
The study of the biosafety issues related to microfluidic chips was done by Axel de Tonnac, Grégoire Repond and Thomas Simonet.
The human practices part of the project was mainly done by Sakura Nussbaum and Ione Pla.
The wiki design was done by Arthur Giroux.
Most of the administrative aspect was done by Ione Pla.
The entire team contributed to the content of the wiki.
The Teaching Assistants and Professors gave us regular feedback at the weekly meetings throughout the project.
