A note on protocols
Here we present a selection of the most important protocols we gathered over the course of our lab work. Many are adapted from freely available protocols and in these case a link is provided to the original. Any modifications we made are through trial and error experience on our part and may therefore not translate to your project. Acknowledgments are also listed thanking people who helped us with our project.

Protocols
Isolation of plasmid DNA from bacteria (miniprep)
Pellet bacterial cells by centrifuging 1.5 ml of culture in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube at 4000 rpm for 2 minutes
Discard supernatant by pipetting off ensuring not to disturb the pellet
Resuspend in 250 µl of resuspension solution by vortexing or pipetting up and down. Do not incubate for more than 5 minutes
Add 350 µl of neutralisation solution and mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times
Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes
Transfer supernatant to a GeneJET spin column by pipetting. Do not disturb the white precipitate
Centrifuge the GeneJET spin column for 1 minute at 13,000 rpm
Discard the flow through
Add 500 µl of wash solution to the column
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,000 rpm
Discard flow through
Add 500 µl of wash solution to the column
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,000 rpm
Discard flow through
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,000 rpm
Transfer the GeneJET column to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube
Add 35 µl of ultrapure water. Do not touch the membrane with the pipette
Incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes
Centrifuge for 2 minutes at 13,000 rpm
Making glycerol stock
This protocol is adapted from 2 freely available protocols 1 , 2 . Ignore steps 2-4 if antibiotic was not present in the overnight broth. Work in a sterile cabinet
Take 0.5 ml from overnight culture and transfer to a centrifuge using sterile DNAase/RNAase free tips
Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 2 minutes
Discard supernatant
Add 0.5 ml of 60% glycerol stock
240 ml of glycerol
160 ml nano pure water
mix together and autoclave
freeze at -80℃
Taking optical density of culture
Recommendation for taking OD for monitoring growth is either OD730 3 or OD750 4 . Some recommend taking OD730 at no higher than 0.4 because of problems with light scattering 4 . We chose to measure at growth OD750 to keep in line with other high-profile papers on Synechocystis 4 .
Set spectrophotometer to measure at OD750
Blank with 1 ml of BG-11 in a cuvette
Measure 1 ml of culture
If OD is over 1 dilute the 235 ul of culture in 750 ul of BG-11
Converting OD750 to cell density For conversion of cell densities to numbers of cells, we have used the relationship OD750 = 1 (a.u) corresponding to 1.6 x 108 cells mL 5 .
PCR
PCR was used as a means of amplifying each one of our biobrick constructs. Each construct, along with its corresponding flanking sequence of 50-100 bases, was amplified out of each transformed pSB1C3 plasmid.
Prior to PCR, it was ensured that all DNA obtained from miniprep was of a concentration of at least 1ng/ul per 100bp; this was performed using a desktop ThermoScientific NanoDrop machine. All PCR tubes were kept on ice prior to usage.
2μl of each of the VFR (forward) and VR (reverse) primers were added to sterile PCR tubes, along with 2μl of each respective transformed plasmid and 14μl phusion mastermix 6
PCR program program as follows:
Start:
95℃ for 30 seconds
35 cycles:
95℃ for 10 seconds
56℃ for 15 seconds
72℃ for 70 seconds
Final
72℃ for 5 minutes
68℃ for 10 minutes
All PCR products were cleaned up using a ThermoScientific GeneJET PCR Purification Kit, using the provided protocol 7
Transformation into E. coli
Thaw tubes of competent cells on ice and transfer 50 ul to a pre-chilled 1.5 ml Eppendorf
Add 5 ul of DNA using a sterile pipette tip
Flick the tubes to mix and then store on ice for 30 minutes
Heat shock in a water bath at 42℃ for 1 minute
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes
Add 450 ul of SOC (we used LB instead)
Place tubes horizontally at 37℃ for 2 hours on a shaker at 250 rpm
Invert Eppendorfs containing the cells several times
Plate out and incubate overnight at 37℃
Notes on transformation efficency
Expected transformation efficiency is 1 x 106 cfu/ug of pUC19 DNA, but we should expect a 2-fold decrease in efficiency due to use of LB instead of SOC (a derivative of super optimal broth, SOB). We should also expect a decrease because we thawed the frozen competent cells at a temperature above 0ºC. Ideally they should be thawed on ice, or by hand if needed 8 .
Nanodrop
Nanodrop is used to check concentration in DNA often from a miniprep
Set the Nanodrop to measure DNA
Blank the Nanodrop by placing 2 ul of PCR water on the stage and pressing blank
Add 2 ul of sample and measure. Measurement should be in ng/ul
BG-11 plates
BG-11 plates are used to grow Cyanobacteria. Antibiotics are added as needed for selection. 1.5% agar is used.
Add 7.55 g of agar to 500 ml BG-11 and autoclave to sterilise
If making kanamycin plates cool to ~55℃ and add 50 ug/ml
Agar melted in steamer and kept at 55℃ until needed for pouring
If making a kanamycin cap:
0.6% agar w/v
Cool BG-11 to ~55ºC and add 0.5mg/ml kan
Add ~3ml to a plain BG-11 plate with transformed colonies on it
Leave for >1 week for Kan selection to occur
Cyanobacteria Transformation
Protocol to transform DNA into cyanobacteria
Make a fresh culture to OD730=0.2 to 0.3 and grow for 3 days
Centrifuge 1.5 ml of culture at 4000g for 10 min. Remove supernatant
Repeat step 2
Add 1 ml BG-11, resuspend to wash, centrifuge at 4000g for 10 min, remove supernatant
Add 200ml fresh BG-11
4ug plasmid A DNA is added (at a concentration of at least 100ng/ul)
Incubate for 24 under light on a shaker at ~100 rpm
Plate the full 200ml and leave for 1-2 days
Add 3-4ml kan 0.6% agar BG-11
Leave under light for >1 week
After many attempts to transform with Cyanobacteria we refined this protocol
Grow 6803 to ~0.435
Take 1 ml, re-wash with BG-11
Re-suspend in 90ml BG-11
Plasmid DNA at ~270ng/ul
add 8ul to each tube
place in 34ºC water bath, unshaken, in the dark, for 3 hours and 20 minutes
transfer to warm room at 28ºC and leave overnight
plate on Kan50 and leave under light, agar-side down
Biobrick Assembly
Protocol for inserting a construct into a plasmid backbone. In the case of BioBrick this will commonly be pSB1C3. Biobrick has 2 stages, a digestion stage and a ligation stage:
In a PCR tube add 20 ul of water and either 5 ul of your construct or 2 ul of plasmid backbone
To the same tube add 2.5 ul of NED buffer
Add appropriate restriction enzymes. In our case 1 ul of EcoR1 and 1 ul of Pst1
Incubate the tubes at 37℃ for 15 minutes
Then incubate at 80℃ for 20 minutes
Add 5 ul of water to a new tube followed by 2 ul of the digested construct and backbone
Add 2 ul of 10X T4 DNA ligase restriction buffer
Add 1 ul of T4 DNA ligase
Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes
Incubate reaction mixture at 80℃ for 20 minutes. This step inactivates the enzyme
This DNA can now be used for transformation
