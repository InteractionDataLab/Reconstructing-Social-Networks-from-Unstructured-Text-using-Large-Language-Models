Our parts
Genetic modification in Synechocystis is done by modifying the chromosome, rather than inserting plasmids. Synechocystis is naturally transformable, and will undergo homologous recombination between its chromosome and a plasmid containing a homologous region. This means that plasmids for insertion or deletion need to have regions of ~500 to ~1000bp either side of the inserted sequence, making modifications time consuming or costly depending on your method of plasmid construction. We will therefore submit all our BioBricks for insertions and deletions to the registry. All of these will contain Kanamycin resistance for simple selection of transformants.
Above: Wild-type Synechocystis transformed with a plasmid carrying kanamycin resistance.
The mechanism for each of the BioBricks is the same. They will undergo recombination with the region that they share homology with. Knockouts will undergo recombination with the specified gene, replacing it with kanamycin resistance. Insertions will undergo recombination with a region of the chromosome that is not important for the metabolic conditions we are using, and will insert the gene of interest along with a kanamycin resistance gene.
We are creating 4 BioBricks that will be submitted to registry, consisting of 2 deletions ( PsaD and PilT1 ) and 2 insertions ( PetF and PilA1 ). Background information on the aim of these parts can be found in our project section .
