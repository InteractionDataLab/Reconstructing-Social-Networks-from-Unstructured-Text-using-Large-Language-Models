Risk Assessment
As part of our project we looked into whether it was possible to actually install a GM-cyanobacterial solar panel onto a roof. From this, we have learnt that information on the safety of our organism and our panel has to be sent to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Department for Environmental, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Information on our organism concerned carrying out a risk assessment in line with regulation 5 and Schedule 3, Part 2 of the HSE Contained Use regulations for the UK.
