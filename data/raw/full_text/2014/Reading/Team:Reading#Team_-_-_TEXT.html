About Us
We are the University of Reading's first iGEM team. We are an entirely undergraduate team made up of students from both biology and engineering. As such we wanted a project which allow both disciplines to be utilised.
Meet the Team
Matt Smith
The resident biochemist. Lives off coffee and bagels. Enjoys free wifi. Talks in short sentences.
Samuel Hardy
With a strong background in bacteriology and virology, Sam has a resilient interest in utilising some of our planet’s simplest life forms for good. Also the team photographer, activist and Doge enthusiast. Much wow.
Oscar Sanderson
A key part of the lab team and the only colourblind member of the group. In charge of design and colour coordination. Naturally.
Hannah Collard
Hannah is the Biomedical Scientist of the team. She does all the work.
Sam Podmore
In charge of the engineering side of the project. Sam spends most of his time dreaming of Fourier transforms and consuming as much Iron Bru as humanly possible. He's also been caught drinking soup straight from the can (no, seriously).
Most common saying: "Yeah, I could model that"
Andrew Moynihan
With a background in chemistry and programming, Andrew joined the team as an engineer,  although he is able to support the team in the lab as well. Tasked with most of the design  and implementation of the web services, he remains the first point of contact for  information on the wiki.
Domonic Falla
The youngest member of the team and yet also generally regarded as the most attractive  member. His youth belies his precocious wisdom, and correspondingly he is looked to as  very much the spiritual leader of the team.
Jonathan Pennell
Is a microbiologist that isn’t a big fan of lab work, nor people really. After recently  discovering the field that is Bioinformatics he generally tends to stick around computers  more so than living things, he understands them. Trusts them... Talks to them...
Eleanor James
The requisite Welsh person, generally regarded as the life and soul of the synthetic biology  party. Loves riding horses and rowing, but hates slow Internet. Don’t mention sheep.
Calum Brown
Calum is the cynical member of the team. With a background in physics, robotics and  electronics, Calum doesn’t understand humour, and/or punctuation. As an engineer he has  the social skills to interact with a wide range of people and as such he forms part of the  public outreach side of the project.
Advisors
Lauren Vallance
"Starbucks?".
Joel Potts
Advisor to the engineers. Helps with all things programming...if it's in Ruby.
Instructors
Jaroslaw Bryk
Committed to synthetic biology education. Currently fighting a bagel addiction. Gibson Assembly FTW.
Slawomir Nasuto
Professor at The University of Reading within the School of Systems Engineering. Interested in neuroscience, neuroanatomy and brain computer interfaces
