Lab Book
Here we present our lab book: notes, results and any changes to protocols. These notes are mostly unaltered, presented as they were taken over the course of the lab based aspect of the project. Any alterations were to make them more legible for the web. We hope these brief notes offer insight into the daily goings of our lab team. In addition to this all protocols we used are presented on their own page. The lab book is presented in chronological order. All dates are English format ie. DD/MM/YYYY.
14/07/2014
Set up initial cultures of PCC 7942 according to protocol
Measured OD750 in order to quantify growth of cyanobacteria. OD measurement preformed according to protocol.
15/07/2014
Following acquisition of DNA ligase we begin BioBrick assembly using protocol available on protocol page.
Before assembling the BioBricks we checked the concentration of DNA which were attained from miniprep. Protocol for checking DNA concentration suing Nanodrop is available in protocols section.

Final amount will be about 120 ul in each tube. Plate half on BG-11 plates and half on Kan 50 plates. Do not stack plates, place with agar facing up.
OD of 6803 culture for transformation is 0.435
All washes done by resuspending in 1 ml of fresh BG-11 (regardless of the initial volume of culture)
Used plasmid DNA at a concentration of >270 ng/ul
Added 8 ul of plasmid to each tube to give >2 ug plasmid DNA for each tube
Tubes were placed in light and temperature condition as outlines in the table. Tubes 1-4 were put straight into the warm room and placed on the shaker, while tubes 5 and 6 were put in a 34℃ water bath, unshaken, for 3:20:00 and were then transferred to the warm room with the rest of the tubes.
We forgot to shake the tubes every 1-2 hours, so may see reduced transformation efficiency because of this. Left them overnight, rather than for just 4-5 hours, this may also affect transformation efficacy. Tested growth of pond wa8ter
3 replicates of each point water bottle, A and B, were used to test cyanobacteria growth in UV-sterilised pond water, giving cultures A1-3 and B1-3.
OD750 of 1.4 was recorded for the cultures used for inoculating pond water. Spectrophotometer was blanked with BG-11.
ODs were checked for pond water inoculated with 10 ml of the culture measured above. in this case the spectrophotometer was blanked with pond water.
About 150 ml of pond water was used in each case.
They were inoculated into 250 ml conical flasks under sterile conditions and placed in a 75rpm shaker at 27℃ under  light.
