Workshop
We ran a workshop to get the engineers and biologist up-to-speed with the basics of each other's disciplines.
Ioannis Zoulias was very helpful, running excellent talks and practicals on engineering basics.
Jarek Bryk, Dean Madden and John Schollar from the NCBE also gave fantastic talks and practicals on basic microbiology and genetics, and ran the workshop for us.
We would also like to thank members of staff in the Hopkins building for letting us use the teaching labs for this, and for lending us a spectrophotometer for the summer.
