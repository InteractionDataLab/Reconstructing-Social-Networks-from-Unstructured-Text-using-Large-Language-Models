1.Done manually:
1.Collect a 2 mL blood sample from patient in EDTA tube with 2 mL of RNA later;
2.Take a 500 μL fraction from the collected blood sample and transfer to 1.5mL PCR tubes;
2.Robot:
1.Adds 1mL of lysis solution (custom designed) in the 500 μL of blood, mix and wait 10 minutes;
2.After 10 minutes, heat the PCR tube at 56°C for 10 minutes;
3.Centrifuge at 8.000 rpm for 5 minutes;
4.Heat the PCR tube at 98ºC for 1min;
1.Take 5 μL of the supernatant part of the liquid inside the PCR tube to the biosensor.
