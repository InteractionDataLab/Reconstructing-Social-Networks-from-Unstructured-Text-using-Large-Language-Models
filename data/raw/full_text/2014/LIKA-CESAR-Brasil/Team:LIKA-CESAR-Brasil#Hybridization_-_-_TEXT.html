Hybridization Process
To perform the hybridization process, 3μL target synthetic solution (miRNA) at different concentrations (1x10-6 the 1x10-12M) was dropped on the working electrode. The electrode remained under 300 rpm agitation at a temperature of annealing of 52 ° C for 10 minutes (the description of the manufacturing company sequence). Tests positive for breast cancer provided by the Baron of Lucena-PE Hospital biological samples were also performed. After completion of the hybridization tests with different targets, hybridization tests with non-complementary targets were made.
