Meet Up
We participate in the Meet up of teams from Brazil, called Jamboré, on August 2. The event was held at USP (São Paulo) and brought together teams of: São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Manaus and ours (Pernambuco). The opportunity to exchange experiences in the encounter was wonderful. Unfortunately, most of the team can not be physically present at the event, due to the action filed by the team the next day. However, even the skype was possible to exchange experiences.
Besides Meet up with teams from Brazil, the CESAR-BRAZIL-LIKA attended the newletter of the iGEM initiative Team ParisBittecourt and Xiamen. The newsletter made ​​possible the exchange of knowledge and clarification of doubts among several teams in the world. The issues may be found in the link:
