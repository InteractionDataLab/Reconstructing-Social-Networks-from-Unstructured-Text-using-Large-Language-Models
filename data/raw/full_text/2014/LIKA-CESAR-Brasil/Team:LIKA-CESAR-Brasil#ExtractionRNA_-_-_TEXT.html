Materials needed Qiagen RNeasy mini kit
1) Pipette 600 µl blood in a tube of 1.5 mL.
2) Add 900 µl of lysis buffer, incubate for 10 minutes under stirring.
3) After centrifugation for 5 minutes at 14.000rpm.
4) Add to the pellet µl RLT buffer 600. Mix by pipetting.
5) Pipette the lysate directly into a column of the RNeasy mini kit, centrifuge for 2 min at maximum speed.
6) Add 1 volume of 70% ethanol to the homogenized lysate and mix well by pipetting. Do not centrifuge.
7) Add 700 µl Buffer RW1 to the RNeasy spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 15 s in ≥8000 xg (≥10,000rpm).
8) Add 500 µL of RPE buffer to the RNeasy spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 15 s in ≥8000 xg (≥10,000 rpm).
9) Add 500 µL of RPE buffer to the RNeasy spin column. Close the lid gently and centrifuge for 2 minutes at ≥8000 xg (≥10,000 rpm).
10) Place the RNeasy spin column in a new collection tube 1.5 ml (supplied). Add 30-50 µl RNAase free water directly onto the spin column membrane. Close the lid gently, and centrifuge for 1 min at ≥8000 xg (≥10,000 rpm) to elute the RNA.
