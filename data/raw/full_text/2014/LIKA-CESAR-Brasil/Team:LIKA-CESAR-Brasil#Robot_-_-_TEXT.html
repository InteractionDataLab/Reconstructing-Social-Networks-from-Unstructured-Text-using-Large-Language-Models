The Bot was created to automate the processes required for the creation of the biosensor for breast cancer. For this, were needed to achieve two functions: The extraction of DNA and RNA from the blood and the readings of biosensors.
Due to the time of iGEM, we focus our efforts on making the Bot perform nucleic acid extraction from blood, for use in the biosensor. For this function, the Bot needed to have a structure those stores and transferred lysis solution (homemade) for eppedorfs with blood, and a centrifuge for separating waste from the extraction cell, the genetic material.
For this purpose, it was built an interconnected to a robotic arm electrical syringe. This system is responsible for transferring regulated lysis solution for eppedorfs. Then one also has built centrifuge to separate the trash from the extraction cell's genetic material required. The robot we designed so far is made with five main parts: control unit, power supply, automated syringe system, robotic arm and centrifuge. All custom designed parts described below was made by us using 3D modeling software and 3D printer. This approach made our prototyping process faster.
On figure 1 shows the robot with all parties.
Then, in Figure 2 it is possible see the control unit system.
In Figure 3, shows the electric syringe constructed with the capacity to direct the solution with control and  precision.
Finally, figure 4 shows the robotic arm capable of moving up and deliver the solution coming from the syringe to the eppedorfs, and centrifuge capable of achieving speeds of up to 10,000 rpm.
