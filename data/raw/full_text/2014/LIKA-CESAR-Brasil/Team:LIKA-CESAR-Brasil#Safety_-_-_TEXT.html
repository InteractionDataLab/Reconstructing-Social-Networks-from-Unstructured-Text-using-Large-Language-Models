SAFETY
Genetic modification performed in E. coli did not cause any kind of harm or danger to humans or the environment,   different pathogenicity of E. coli itself. So our form of biosecurity was returned to medidades prevention and control in the management of E. Coli. It is possible to check with the answers of the biosafety questionnaire listed below.
1-Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab: Probability of adverse health of the team members and the environment due to poor handling of organisms work, consequent activity of pathogenic or potentially pathogenic biological agents.
2-Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab): Probability of contamination by the population. E. coli. With the release of pathogenic organisms contamination of water and food Some could occur, thus causing infection transmission.
3-Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab): If has a leak biological material from the laboratory , may occur especially contamination of groundwater, for lack of a sewage treatment system, thus compromising the environment.
4-Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries: Risks related to misuse of organisms present in the project are classified with agents that do not present a high risk to the handler or community. Being related only with the characteristics mentioned in the response to letter a and b.Considering the long-term, the contamination of the user of the system as well as contamination of the environment by the discharge are concerns on the use of the proposed system.
5-What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.) In general, security measures for biological hazards involves: Knowledge of the Law on Biosafety;  Knowledge of the risks by the handler; The training and information of the people involved, especially with regard to how this contamination can occur, which implies broad knowledge of the microorganism with which it works; Compliance with the General Safety Rules and further the achievement of personal protection; Use of the apron, disposable (and / or washing hands before and after handling), mask and goggles (to prevent aerosols or projections in the eye) and other Personal Protective Equipment needed gloves, Use of laminar flow properly, keeping it clean after use; Autoclaving of pathogenic biological material, before dropping it in the trash; Use of appropriate disinfectant for inactivation of a specific agent.
6-What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available? Considering the long-term, the contamination of the user of the system as well as contamination of the environment by the discharge are concerns on the use of the proposed system.
7-Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them. We plan to study ways to reduce the risks of use of E.coli in the project. Not yet found a solution to the long-term product.
