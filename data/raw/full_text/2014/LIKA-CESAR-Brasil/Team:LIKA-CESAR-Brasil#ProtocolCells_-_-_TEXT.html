Protocol competent cells
Materials:
Sterile equipment;  Cell line E. coli TOP 10; LB liquid culture media, solid LB, SOB and SOC;
Antibiotic (40ug / mL - Chloramphenicol);  CCMB caps 80 and NEB;  Centrifugal;  Tubes for centrifugation;  pHmeter; Sterile filter;  2 ml tubes; Resistance plasmid; Spectrophotometer OD 600 nm.
Procedure
1) Grow cells of E. coli on a 100 mL Erlenmeyer culture medium LB under constant agitation for 16 hours, at 37 ° C after this time measuring time of 0.5 OD.
2) Isolate colonies to the protocol of competence procedure.
3) Grow cells in SOB medium. 4 ml of cells were incubated in SOB medium (250 ml) was stirred at 23 ° C until OD reaches 0.3 nm.
4) After OD desired transfer the culture to centrifuge tubes background. Weigh and balance the tubes.
5) Centrifuge at 3000 g at 4 ° C for 10 minutes.
6) Discard supernatant into waste container containing chlorine bleach.
7) Resuspend cell pellet with cold CCMB80 buffer in a total volume of 80 ml​​
8) Incubate the cells resuspended in an ice bath for 20 minutes.
9) Centrifuge at 3000 g at 4 ° C for 10 minutes.
10) Decant the supernatant into the waste container containing chlorine bleach.
11) Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml cold CCMB80 buffer.
12) Aliquot 200 µl of a mixture SOC and 50 µl of resuspended cells and measuring the OD (600 nm). Using a mixture of 200 µl of SOC medium and 50 ul CCMB80 as white for measurement. Obtaining of 1 O.D 1.5 nm.
13) Finally storing the cells at -80 ° C in glycerol. (30 µl glycerol + 170 µl cell culture).
