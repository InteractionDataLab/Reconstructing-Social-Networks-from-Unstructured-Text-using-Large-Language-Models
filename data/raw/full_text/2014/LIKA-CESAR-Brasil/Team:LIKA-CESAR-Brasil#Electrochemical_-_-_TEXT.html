Electrochemical Analysis
For the analysis of electrochemical signals, biosensors was analyzed using Tris-HCl pH 7.0 buffer and Phosphate 0.1M Ph 7.4 buffer.  It was used one potentiostat AUTOLAB equipment as the interface NOVA 2.0 software, where a potential sweep was applied were observed in range of 0.5 to 1.2V, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the range of -0.8 to 1.0V with an amplitude of 10 mV and scan rate 20 mV / s.
