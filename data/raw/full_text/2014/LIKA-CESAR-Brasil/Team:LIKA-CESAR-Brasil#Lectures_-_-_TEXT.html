Team LIKA-CESAR-BRASIL believes the key to success is multidisciplinary. For this, we believe that the exchange of information between different areas should be encouraged. Thinking about it, the team conducted several lectures and organized a workshop. Initially, a lecture on Biosensors and Synthetic Biology was held at C.E.S.A.R. (Center facing the Information, Electronics and Robotics Technology). The lecture was intended to unify the areas of knowledge and had 40 participants.
Then, the team developed the first synthetic biology workshop and technological innovation. The workshop took place on August 1, at the Federal University of Pernambuco and had 100 participants. The lectures were divided into themes such as "Synthetic Biology: Now and Future", "Autonomous Biosensors: Powering applications through robotics", "Artificial intelligence and advances in molecular diagnosis"; "The codes of synthetic biology viewed as software - everything is really software?" among others.
The idea of the workshop was to disseminate beyond synthetic biology, was also joining synthetic biology with areas of information technology and robotics, thus relying on the audience of undergraduate and graduate biomedical, medicine, biology, science computing, electronic engineering among others. We also had the chance to publicize our work in international symposium on diagnostics and therapeutics (http://www.sinater.org/2014/) that occurred between days 27 and August 29, with a lecture by Eduardo Peixoto. As Roberta Godone spoke about our work in the twenty-first week of biomedicine from Federal University of Pernambuco (http://www.dabiom.com/semana) that occurred from 22 to 26 September.
