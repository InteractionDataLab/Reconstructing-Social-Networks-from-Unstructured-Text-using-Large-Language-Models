Who are we?
Instructors:
Deborah Zanforlin - Biomedical, a PhD student in Applied Biology Health (LIKA) and currently works with biosensors. I am aspiring to be a scientist, of the crazy type. I love everything that has glucose as its main composition. Competitive and dreamy, it was simple and easy to become an iGEMer.
Jones Albuquerque - Teacher at UFRPE and CESAR.edu also Chief Scientist of SENAI Institute for Innovation in Information and Communication Technologies. Work with computer models in Public Health and automatic diagnosis of Schistosomiasis and Malaria. Biosensors are in my studies. Triathlon enthusiast that prefers long competitions with teams that are compromised and fun to work with, like the CESAR – LIKA for the iGEM!
Members
Roberta Godone – Biologist and Master in Biochemistry, I am currently a PhD student in Applied Biology Health (LIKA), specifically working with molecular diagnosis of breast cancer. Biology has always been my passion. Love metabolic pathways and chemical reactions! I am a worshiper of animals and nature. I have great competitive spirit and challenges are like a magnet for me. So joining the iGEM was to unite business with pleasure
Mirella Silva Monteiro - Biomedical student and undergraduate researcher at LIKA in the biosensors laboratory. I am a fan of chocolate, series and books. I love competitions, so did not even think twice in participating the iGEM.
Filipe Villa Verde – He was graduated in Medicine at UFPE, and is majoring in Computer Science from UNICAP and intern in CESAR. I work with the interface between computing and life sciences. Has worked with telemedicine and currently is in the area of Synthetic Biology, Biosensors specifically. Enjoy photography and music. Participating in the iGEM is an exciting challenge because of the integration between biology and technology.
Raphael Brito - is majoring in Computer Science from the Catholic University of Pernambuco and CESAR intern that works with software development. Likes music a lot. A committed team and challenging competitions are exciting and well-LIKA CESAR in iGEM is that!
Lucas Cavalcanti - Electronics technician by the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Pernambuco and technical systems in CESAR Working with robotics, is passionate about technology and machines. Joining the team LIKA-CESAR and going to iGEM is a good opportunity to expand our knowledge, producing something to help the world.
Renato Pessoa – I am a biomedical student and undergraduate researcher at LIKA in the biosensors laboratory. Daydreamer and a gamer at heart that loves to be challenged. The iGEM competition is a good opportunity to learn.
Maria Amelia Borba (Mell) - almost biomedical and work with biosensors. I love reading, ice cream and music. I am curious, so I choose biomedicine, that is how I fell for biosensors and is also why I bumped the challenge of iGEM.
Andriu Catena - Biomedical, Master student in Biology Applied to Health (LIKA). I opted for science as a hobby, curiosity as a profession. Working with molecular biology applied to diagnosis. Enjoys movies, music and books, cannot live without sushi. I am very competitive so, joining the iGEM is one more challenge.
Fátima Cardoso- Portuguese formed in biological engineering. PhD student in diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer in LIKA. Passionate about books and series! Love challenges and new experiences in addition to having competitive spirit, hence the participation in iGEM!
