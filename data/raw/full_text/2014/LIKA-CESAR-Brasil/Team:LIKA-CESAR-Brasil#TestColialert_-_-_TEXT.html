Test of ColiAlert with different pH
1) 200 µl of the bacterial suspension (cells with chromogenic protein) were mixed with 1 mL of acetic acid. Homogenized mixture to the tube changing color. After change of color was added to this tube 500 µl a solution of tri-basic. Mix until the solution color change. (Reversible by changing pH reaction).
2) 200 µl of the bacterial suspension was mixed with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The solution was homogenized by observing color change. After change of color was added to 500 µl Tris base solution, homogenized again for observation of solution color change. (Reaction irreversible cell bacterial lysis and release intracellular proteins).
