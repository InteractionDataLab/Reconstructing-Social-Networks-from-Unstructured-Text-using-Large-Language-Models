Biossensor Construction
An electrochemical system consisting of three conducting lines was used, these were printed on the surface of the PS (Polystyrene). They were then painted, where the reference electrode was painted with Ag / AgCl (ACHENSON) and then the working and auxiliary electrodes with a mixture of carbon ink. Done so they have been washed intensively with a solution of 0.1% sulfuric acid and ultrapure water and then were dried in an oven for 60 min at a temperature of 60C. Analyses were performed using the potentiostat AUTOLAB equipment, using as the interface NOVA 1.9 software. Production of Polymer for Immobilization: A biosensor platform was modified conductive material such as polymers and allotropes of carbon (graphene) which also enabled the immobilization of probe target on the electrode surface. Process for the production of nanocomposite, the method for forming the modified Hummer oxidized graphene was used. To increase the conductivity of oxidized graphene took place preparation of polyaniline nanofibers with silver nanoparticles. During the synthesis of polyaniline nanofibers as p-aminobenzenesulfonic acid monomers for doping the polymer chain with sulphonic groups (SO3) was used. This device was used as in normal conditions, polyaniline has its conductive properties only in acidic pH, doping with the new structure formed is capable of maintaining its conductive properties in higher pH, thereby allowing the biosensor to be used with samples developed biological (pH 7-7.4).
