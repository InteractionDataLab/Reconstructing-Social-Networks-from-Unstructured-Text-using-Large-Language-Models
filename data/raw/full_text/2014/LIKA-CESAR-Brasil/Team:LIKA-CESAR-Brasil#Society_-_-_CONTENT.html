It is known that the current method of prevention is mammography, which after 40 years should be performed annually. The purpose the survey was to understand the profile of women, if they do prevention, and if do not, for what reasons. </P><P>The total of 432 women completed the questionnaire of 21 states of Brazil. However, we obtained better results with the Pernambuco population, accounted for 76.8% of the responses.</P><P class="graphics">Figura 02</P><P class="graphics">Women who responded, 5.1% had the sad experience of breast cancer.</P><P class="graphics">Figura 03</P><P class="graphics">The survey was conducted with women over 18 years. Of the total, 35.4% of women were between 18 and 28 years, 30.3% had 29-39 years. The questionnaire also elicited responses of women at older ages, with 15.5% of women 51-61 years of age and 4.4% of responses from women over 62 years.</P><P class="graphics">Figura 04</P><P class="graphics">Research on of race of women surveyed was also performed. 59.8% of women belonged to the white race.</P><P class="graphics">Figura 05</P><P class="graphics">It was asked to these women about the kind of healthcare that they possessed. In Brazil we have the only health system, known as SUS program whereby citizens are serviced for free by the government. Also, health plans, in which citizens have the option of being treated in private hospitals through health plans. Around 77.3% of women questioned reported having health insurance.</P><P class="graphics">Figura 06 e 07</P><P class="graphics">To better understand the profile of the women who answered our questionnaire also asked about their level of education. Most women possessed college degrees conforming 63.9% of women. The most of them working in the area of communication and health.</P><P class="graphics">Figura 08</P><P class="graphics">In addition, it was used as a criterion for characterization of population, the financial class that these women belonged. In Brazil, the average minimum wage is $ 400. We receive a variety of responses, with 39.8% of women with recipe 5-15 minimum wages and 34.9% lower with revenues ranging 2-5 minimum wages.</P><P class="graphics">Figura 09</P><P class="graphics">Most women were answering the questionnaire live in metropolitan cities, but still it was possible to..
					   </P><P class="graphics">Figura 10</P><P class="graphics">The above questions were to characterize the profile of the woman who answered the questionnaire. Then asked about breast cancer. Where these women were asked about this disease (TV, internet, visits to doctors). Overall, 39.4% claimed to have information about the disease in visits to doctors, but a percentage of 30.8% claim to have television as largest information center.</P><P class="graphics">Figura 11</P><P class="graphics">In Brazil, health policy recommends that women over 40 do mammography (preventive test) at least once a year. Therefore, for the populace of that age, we asked how often they performed this examination. The majority (65.8%) answered that they regularly examination (every year), while 20.5% do the exam, but not every year.</P><P class="graphics">Figura 12</P><P class="graphics">For those who said they do not follow the recommendations of health policy, ask the reasons that led to it. Claiming to run the day-to-day, 35.2% said they had no time. Other 24.1% said they cannot schedule appointments with doctors or vacancies in mammography equipment. The percentage 18.5% reported forgetting to take the examination. Still existed 14.5% of women who spoke to know the importance of the exam, but not performed by the discomfort and pain that the exam question.</P><P class="graphics">Figura 13</P><P class="graphics">Our results are small in relation to population. However, through research it was observed that many women have information about breast cancer and how to prevent. Many of these women undergo mammograms every year. Even so, we conducted the research in the field on August 3 (figura 13), in Dona Lindu Park in Pernambuco located on the beach of Boa Viagem. In this research, in addition to collect our responses even did a campaign to raise awareness about breast cancer and tests plus advice on the need for mammograms every year.</P><P class="graphics">Figura 14</P><P class="graphics">Our team also participated in the organization of a bike ride in the fight against breast cancer. The idea was to mobilize people of Recife regarding the importance of the issue of breast cancer.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
