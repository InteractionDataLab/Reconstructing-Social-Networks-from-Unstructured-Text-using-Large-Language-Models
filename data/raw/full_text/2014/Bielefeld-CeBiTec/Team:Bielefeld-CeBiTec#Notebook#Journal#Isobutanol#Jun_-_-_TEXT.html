alsS
This week we aim to transform the construct from the parts distribution.
Transformation with electrocompotetent cells
K539627 : pSB1C3-alsS (parts distribution from 2013, plate 1, 24H)
Plasmid isolation of alsS
Sequencing confirmed the identity of pSB1C3-alsS.
Glycerin stock created: E. coli KRX pSB1C3-alsS
ilvC
This week we aim to transform the construct from the parts distribution.
Transformation with electrocompotetent cells
K539621 : pSB1C3-ilvC (parts distribution from 2013, plate 1, 24F)
Plasmid isolation of ilC
Sequencing confirmed the identity of pSB1C3-ilvC.
Glycerin stock created: E. coli KRX pSB1C3-ilvC
ilvD
This week we aim to transform the construct from the parts distribution.
Transformation with electrocompotetent cells
K539626 : pSB1C3-ilvD (parts distribution from 2013, plate 1, 22J)
Plasmid isolation of ilvD
Sequencing confirmed the identity of pSB1C3-ilvD.
Glycerin stock created: E. coli KRX pSB1C3-ilvD
kivD
This week we aim to transform the construct from the parts distribution.
Transformation with electrocompotetent cells
K539742 : pSB1C3-kivD (parts distribution from 2013, plate 1, 24L)
Plasmid isolation of kivD
Sequencing confirmed the identity of pSB1C3-kivD.
Glycerin stock created: E. coli KRX pSB1C3-kivD
Week 5     06/30 - 07/06
Week 5 06/30 - 07/06
alsS
This week we tried to amplify alsS to use it for the Gibson Assembly.
PCR amplification ( fw_alsS_pSB1C3 , rv_ilvC_alsS )
Annealing temperature: 55 °C
Bands not as expected (~ 1800 bp)
ilvC
This week we tried to amplify ilvC to use it for the Gibson Assembly.
PCR amplification ( fw_alsS_ilvC , rv_ilvD_ilvC )
Annealing temperature: 55 °C
Bands not as expected (~ 1550 bp)
ilvD
This week we tried to amplify ilvD to use it for the Gibson Assembly.
PCR amplification ( fw_ilvC_ilvD , rv_kivD_ilvD )
Annealing temperature: 55 °C
Bands not as expected (~ 1950 bp)
kivD
This week we tried to amplify kivD to use it for the Gibson Assembly.
PCR amplification ( fw_ilvD_kivD , rv_pSB1C3_kivD )
Annealing temperature: 55 °C
Bands not as expected (~ 1750 bp)
Backbone
This week we tried to amplify the backbone pSB1C3 to use it for the Gibson Assembly.
PCR amplification ( fw_kivD_pSB1C3 , rv_alsS_pSB1C3 )
Annealing temperature: 55 °C
Bands not as expected (~ 2.200 kb)
PCR conditions need to be optimized due to low product quality and missing products
