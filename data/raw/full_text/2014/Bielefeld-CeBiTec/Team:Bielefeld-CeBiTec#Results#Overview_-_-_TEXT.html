Overview
With our project we like to address the problem of energy storage as well as the increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. Excess electricity will be used to bind atmospheric carbon dioxide in bacteria. The carbon is used to produce different commercially interesting products. As a proof of concept we decided to implement this system using Escherichia coli. Advantages of this concept will be the use of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere under usage of available electricity on the one hand and the production of high value products on the other.
