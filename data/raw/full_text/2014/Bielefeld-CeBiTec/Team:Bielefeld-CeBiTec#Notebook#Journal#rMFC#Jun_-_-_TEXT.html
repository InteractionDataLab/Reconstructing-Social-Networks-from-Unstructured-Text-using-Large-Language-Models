Week 3     06/16 - 06/22
Week 3     06/16 - 06/22
Initial cultivation experiments with neutral red
This week we wanted to test the properties of neutral red during a cultivation on a small scale
Cultivation of the E. coli strain with porines (attempt 1) and wildtyp as control (attempt 2) in LB-medium with 100 µM neutral red
pH was set up at 8.75
Results
Attempt 1 turned red (pH = 7.495)
Attempt 2 remained yellow
Week 4     06/23 - 06/29
Week 4     06/23 - 06/29
Reduction and oxidation of neutral red
This week we checked the properties of neutral red under oxidizing and reducing conditions by adding chemical agents
Reducing agent: sodium dithionite
Red solution got reduced and turned colorless
Got oxidised by air again afterwards
Oxidizing agent: hydrogen peroxide
Red solution stayed red
Yellow solution stayed yellow
Conclusion: the color of the solution depends on the pH
Week 5     06/30 - 07/06
Week 5 06/30 - 07/06
Further cultivation experiments with neutral red
This week we cultivated E. coli in LB-medium with 100 µM neutral red which was reduced by different concentrations of sodium dithionite before
Attempts and controls
Negative controls:
0 µl of sodium dithionite
100 µl of sodium dithionite
200 µl of sodium dithionite
500 µl of sodium dithionite
Positive control:
0 µl sodium dithionite with E. coli
Attempts:
100 µl sodium dithionite with E. coli
200 µl sodium dithionite with E. coli
500 µl sodium dithionite with E. coli
Results
Negative controls: all controls got colored probably through oxidation by air
Positive control: turned yellow and turbid probably because of alkaline conditions and high cell density
Attempts: all attempts turned red but no turbidity is visible probably because sodium dithionite could be toxic to the cells
