Outlook
Characterisation and cultivation
The advantages of an electrochemical measuring cell with separated compartments are that there is no mixing within the nascent products of electrolysis of the anode- and cathode compartment and the possibility to use different buffers in both compartments.
The characterization of different mediators was performed cell free in phosphate buffer .  During the measurements the electrode material could be varied and we tried out different settings for the creation of a cyclic voltamogramm. We investigated the influence of the scan rate, the potential range and thethe positioning of the electrodes. All measurements were performed with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and without aeration.
