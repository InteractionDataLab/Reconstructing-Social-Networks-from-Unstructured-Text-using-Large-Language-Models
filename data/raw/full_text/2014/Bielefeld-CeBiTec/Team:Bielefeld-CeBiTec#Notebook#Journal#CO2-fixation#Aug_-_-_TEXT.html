Purification of the carboxysome
We want to express and purify the carboxysome based on the plasmid pHnCBcsoS1D, which we received from addgene. The procedure is based on methods described by Bonacci et al., 2011 and So et al., 2004 .
Grow cells containing the pHnCBcsoS1D in TB medium containing antibiotic at 20 °C overnight
Dilute the overnight culture 1:50 in TB medium containing antibiotic. A culture volume of 500 ml was used
Grow cells until they reach an OD600 of 0.9-1.2
Induce protein expression by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 50 µM. Grow cells overnight
Harvest cells by centrifugation with 4500 x g for 20 min at 4 °C
Resuspend cells in 50 mL TEMB buffer. Use protease inhibitors, for example PMSF
TEMB buffer:
5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)
1 mM EDTA
10 mM MgCl2
20 mM NaHCO3
Cell lysis via sonification (6 x 1 min with 1 min cooling interval between every cycle). Therefore a Bandelin Sonopuls HD 2070 with a SH70G with a power of 70 W was used. The power was adjust to 70 %
Centrifuge the disruptet cell material with 12,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C to spin down cell debris. The cellular proteins should be in the supernatant.
Collect the supernatant and centrifuge with 40,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C
Discard supernatant. Resuspend the resulting pellet in 20 mL of a 33 % (vol/vol) solution of CellLytic B ( Sigma ) in TEMB
Centrifuge again with 40,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C
Discard supernatant. Resuspend pellet in 3 mL TEMB buffer. Clarify by centrifugation with 3,000 x g for 1 min
Load the supernatant onto 10 to 50 % (wt/vol) linear sucrose gradient. Sucrose gradients are made by slowly dribbling high % to low % sucrose down the side of the tube. For ultracentrifugation Polyallomer tubes with a volume of 13,2 mL were used. Ultraspin the sample in a Beckman Coulter OptimaTM LE 80 K Ultracentrifuge with a SW41 Ti Swinging Rotor Bucket with 105,000 x g for 30 min
After centrifugation, the carboxysome should be seen as a band near the middle of the gradient
→ The purification was not succesful, as you could not recognize a visible band in the gradient

Purification of the carboxysome
As the purification of the carboxysome showed no results, we decided to induce protein expression with higher concentrations of IPTG.
Cultivation was carried out using a modified method of Cultivation for Expression of recombinant proteins . Cells were continous cultivated by a temperature of 20 °C, and protein expression was induced when the culture reaches an OD600 of 0.9 - 1.2. IPTG in different final concentrations of 0.5 mM, 2 mM and 5 mM was used to verify the expression of the carboxysomal proteins through SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF . Samples were generated using the protocol for Fast Cell Lysis for SDS-PAGE.

Purification of the carboxysome
The results of our experiments suggest that higher IPTG concentrations are needed for a efffective protein expression of the carboxysome. For this reason, we induced the protein expression with a final IPTG concentration of 0,5 mM. The purification was carried out using the protocol as described in our labjournal , but slightly modificated. The culture volumen was upscaled to 1 litre. For a more effective cell lysis, the sonification protocol was modified using eight cylces a one min with one min cooling intervals for sonification.
→ The purification was not succesful, as you could not recognize a visible band in the gradient.
