Problem analysis
Our project is engaged in different big worldwide problems like global warming, the transport and storage of (renewable) electricity and the depletion of crude oil. To gain a better overview we generated different problem trees which help to visualize the dimension of these problems (Figure 1). Secondly it was interesting to identify follow-up problems ensuing our three basic ideas of electric energy storage, fixation of carbon dioxide and production of isobutanol (Figure 2). Finally we build up a tree for problems resulting from our wetlab implementation (Figure 3). The dimension of the resulting problems is quite huge so that we decided to contact different stakeholder and companies, which are depicted in the problem tree, who might be able to help us.

Resulting from our problem trees we developed application scenarios .
