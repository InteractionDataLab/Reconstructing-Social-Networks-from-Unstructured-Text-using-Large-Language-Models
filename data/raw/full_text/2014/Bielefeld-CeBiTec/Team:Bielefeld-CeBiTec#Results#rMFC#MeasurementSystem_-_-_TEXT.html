Measurement system
Introduction to electrochemistry
The investigation of electroactive microorganisms affords an appropriate measurement system. To perform highly sensitive measurements we used a Potentiostat. For the understanding of the mode of operation of a Potentiostat it is necessary to define a few basic principles of electrochemistry. The following definitions come from ( Harnisch, F. & Freguia, 2012 ):
