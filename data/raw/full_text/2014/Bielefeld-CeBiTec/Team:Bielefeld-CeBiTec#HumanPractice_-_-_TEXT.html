Here you will find our projects in Policy & Practices
During our project we get in contact with different persons on several events. For example we supported pupils during their practice week in the lab and helped them with their exhibition. In the Center for Biotechnology we gave a radio interview about the theme "Leben leben". This year Bielefeld celebrated its 800th anniversary year. We had a stand at the NRW-day in the city and supervised some experiments with the children and their parents at this day. In addition we organized experiments for the pupils academy at the university. Together with support of the Athena Instituut we will develop application scenarios and based on this technomoral scenarios by participating at the SYNENERGENE project. In august we organized a wiki meeting with some members of the iGEM-Team Hannover where we explained the basics of HTML and the wiki.
