Outlook
Short summary
Within the third module of our project the products of the carbon dioxide fixation will be used by the cell to produce the key metabolite pyruvate. Pyruvate can be converted in different products. We decided to introduce an isobutanol production pathway. For this we want to use and improve existing BioBricks (iGEM Team Formosa 2011/2012).
The modularity of BioBricks enables the exchange of a variety of producing systems. The producing pathway of variable high value products derived from pyruvate can be implemented. Hence, products like isoprene, putrescine or even antibiotics are possible candidates with industrial application.
Here you will find our results of the production of Isobutanol.
You can find more information about the underlying theory , our genetical approach and an outlook on our wiki
