Isobutanol
Within the third module the products of carbon dioxide fixation will be used by the cell to produce the key metabolite pyruvate. Hence, it can be converted in different products. As a 'proof of concept we decided to introduce an isobutanol production pathway. Here we want to use and improve existing BioBricks (iGEM Team Formosa 2011/2012). The modularity of BioBricks enables the exchange of a variety of production systems. These systems can be applied on variable high value products derived from pyruvate. Pyruvate is a metabolic branching point. Hence, products like isoprene, putrescine or even antibiotics are possible candidates with industrial application.
