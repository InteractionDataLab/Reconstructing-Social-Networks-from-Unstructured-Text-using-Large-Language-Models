Data Page
This page gives a basic overview about our project The Transformers - From Carbon Dioxide To Biofuel. A detailed description of our subprojects can be found in our project part of the Wiki.
With our project we like to address the problem of energy storage as well as the increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. Excess electricity will be used to bind atmospheric carbon dioxide in bacteria. The carbon is used to produce different commercially interesting products. As a proof of concept we decided to implement this system using Escherichia coli. Major advantages of our concept are the use of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere under usage of available electricity on the one hand and the production of isobutanol on the other.
