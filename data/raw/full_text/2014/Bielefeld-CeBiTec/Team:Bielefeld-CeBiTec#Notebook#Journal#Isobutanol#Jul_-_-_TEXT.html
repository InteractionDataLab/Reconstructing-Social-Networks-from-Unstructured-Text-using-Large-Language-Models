General
Week 1     07/07 - 07/13
Week 1     07/07 - 07/13
alsS, ilvC, ilvD, kivD and backbone pSB1C3
We tried to redo the amplification of last week.
Optimization of PCR conditions for coding sequence amplification
Combinations of primers and templates as described before
Annealing temperature gradients from 50°C to 58°C were tried
Product amount was increased by lower annealing temperatures, but still not good enough for Gibson
Week 2     07/14 - 07/20
Week 2     07/14 - 07/20
alsS, ilvC, ilvD, kivD and backbone pSB1C3
We tried to redo the amplification of last week.
Optimization of PCR conditions for coding sequence amplification
Combinations of primers and templates as described before
Annealing temperature gradients from 50°C to 58°C were tried
Product amount was increased by lower annealing temperatures
For the annealing temperature we identified 54°C as optimal.
For the elongation time 90 seconds worked better than 60 seconds.
Week 3     07/21 - 07/27
Week 3     07/21 - 07/27
alsS, ilvC, ilvD, kivD
With the optimized conditions the amplifications were tried again.
PCR amplification with the optimized conditions and the primer combinations as described before
PCR products were extracted out of the gel.
Purfication of the gel slices
This worked well for ilvC, but not for alsS, ilvD and kivD.

Backbone pSB1C3
We aim to amplify it with Q5 polymerase
PCR amplification ( fw_kivD_pSB1C3 , rv_alsS_pSB1C3 ) (Elongationtime: 60 sec)
Annealing temperature: 54 °C
Bands not as expected (~ 2.200 bp)
PCR amplification ( fw_kivD_pSB1C3 , rv_alsS_pSB1C3 ) (Elongationtime: 80 sec)
Annealing temperature: 54 °C
Bands as expected (~ 2.200 bp)
PCR purification of backbone
Week 4     07/28 - 08/03
Week 4     07/28 - 08/03
alsS, ilvC, ilvD, kivD
This week we aim to combine the four CDS's with the pSB1C3 backbone.
Gibson Assembly with kivD, alsS, ilvC and ilvD and pSB1C3
Restriction digestion with DpnI
Transformation with electrocompetent and chemocompetent cells
