Week 1     08/04 - 08/10
Week 1     08/04 - 08/10
psB1C3-alsS-ilvC-ilvD
This week we wanted to identify positive colonies.
Colony PCR ( fw_alsS_ilvC , rv_kivD_ilvD )
Annealing temperature: 65 °C
Bands not as expected (~ 3450 bp)
New try of the combination of the four CDS's with the pSB1C3 backbone.
Gibson Assembly with kivD, alsS, ilvC and ilvD and pSB1C3
Restriction digestion with DpnI
Transformation with electrocompetent and chemocompetent cells
Colony PCR ( fw_alsS_ilvC , rv_kivD_ilvD )
Annealing temperature: 65 °C
Bands not as expected (~ 3450 bp)
Week 2     08/11 - 08/17
Week 2     08/11 - 08/17
alsS, ilvC, ilvD, kivD and backbone of pSB1C3
We started again back by zero to solve our problems.
PCR amplification (as described before)
We used pSB1C3-RFP ( J04450 ) instead of pSB1C3-CFP as template for backbone amplification
Annealing temperature: 65 °C
Bands as expected (~ 2200 bp)
Restriction digestion with DpnI
Gibson Assembly with alsS, ilvC, ilvD and kivD on pSB1C3
Transformation with electrocompotetent cells
Colony PCR ( fw_alsS_ilvC , rv_kivD_ilvD )
Annealing temperature: 65 °C
Bands not as expected (~ 3450 bp)
Week 3     08/18 - 08/24
Week 3     08/18 - 08/24
alsS, ilvC, ilvD, kivD and backbone pSB1K3
This week we tried to begin from zero again with optimized conditions and new competent cells.
Therefor we prepared new plasmids from alsS, ilvC, ilvD, kivD and the backbone pSB1K3-RFP
PCR amplification
Primer were used as described before
pSB1K3-RFP was used as template for backbone amplification
Annealing temperature: 53 °C
Bands as expected for
alsS: about 1800 bp,
ilvC: about  1550 bp,
ilvD: about 1950 bp,
kivD: about 1700 bp,
but not for pSB1K3-RFP
PCR amplification
with Q5 for pSB1K3-RFP
Primer were used as described before
Annealing temperature: 53 °C
Bands as expected (~ 2200 bp)
PCR products were purified
Gibson Assembly with kivD, alsS, ilvC and ilvD on pSB1K3
Restriction digestion with DpnI
Aberation from protocol: Incubation for about 10 hours.
Transformation with electrocompotetent cells
Colony PCR ( fw_ilvC_ilvD , rv_pSB1C3_kivD )
Annealing temperature: 65 °C
Bands as expected (~ 3600 bp)
Colony PCR ( fw_alsS_ilvC , rv_ilvD_ilvC )
Annealing temperature: 65 °C
Bands as expected (~ 3300 bp)
Liquid cultures for a restriction digest were prepared.
Plasmid isolation of pSB1K3-alsS-ilvC-ilvD-kivD
Restriction digestion with NotI
Bands as expected (backbone:~ 2200 bp and insert: ~ 7000 bp)
Week 4     08/25 - 08/31
Week 4     08/25 - 08/31
adhA
This week the Lactococcus lactis arrived. We tried to amplify it's adhA.
DNA isolation of Lactococcus lactis
PCR amplification of the adhA ( rev-pBS1C3-adhA , fw-pSB1C3_adhA ) and the Backbone out of psB1K3-RFP ( rev-adhA_pSB1C3 , fw-adhA-pSB1C3 )
Annealing temperature: 54 °C
Bands as expected (~1200 bp for the adhA and ~ 2200 bp for the Backbone)
PCR products were extracted out of the gel and purified .
Gibson Assembly with adhA and pSB1K3
Restriction digestion with Dpn1
Transformation with chemocompetent cells
Colony PCR ( rev-pBS1C3-adhArev-pBS1C3-adhA , fw-pSB1C3_adhA )
Annealing temperature: 65°C
