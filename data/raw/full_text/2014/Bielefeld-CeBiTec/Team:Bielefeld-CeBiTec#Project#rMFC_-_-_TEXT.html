Short summary
In the first module we aim to identify possible mediators that are capable for electron transport. We want to          use electricity to chemically reduce these mediators and transport them into the cells. The process takes         place in a bioreactor called "reverse microbial fuel cell" (rMFC). One important requirement for a suitable         mediator is that its reduction potential is high enough to restore reduction equivalents, like NAD(P)H        (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate)). These reduction equivalents enter the respiratory chain where        ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is produced which will be used in the next module.
Here you will find the results of              the rMFC.
