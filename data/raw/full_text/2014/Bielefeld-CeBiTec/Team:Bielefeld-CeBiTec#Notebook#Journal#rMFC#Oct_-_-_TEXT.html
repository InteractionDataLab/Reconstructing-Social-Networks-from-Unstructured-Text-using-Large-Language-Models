Electrobiochemical reactor system and cultivation
This week we continued to cultivate in the H-cell reactor by using a potentiostat to control and ensure a constant potential during the whole cultivation.
Cultivation of KRX wildtype B0015 and KRX ΔdcuB::oprF with pSB1C3_T7_frd was planned
To document the growth curve and the consumption of substrate daily samples were taken for OD600 measurement and HPLC analytics
To evaluate the current consumption of the cells a chronoamperometric measurement was performed
