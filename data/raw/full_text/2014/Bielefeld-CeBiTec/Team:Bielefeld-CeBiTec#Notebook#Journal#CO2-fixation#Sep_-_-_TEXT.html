Purification of the carboxysome
Protein expression is induced with a final IPTG concentration of 0,5 mM. The purification was carried out using the protocol as described in our labjournal , but slightly modificated. The culture volumen was upscaled to 1 L. For a more effective cell lysis, the sonification protocol was modified using longer intervalls for sonication and for cooling. Furthermore, the ultracentrifugation was carried out for a longer time (45 min) to obtain a better concentration and seperation.
→ The purification was not succesful, as you could not recognize a visible band in the gradient.

can_csoS1-4 respectively can_csoS1-4_csoS1D and sap

Purification of the carboxysome
Protein expression is still induced with a final IPTG concentration of 0,5 mM. The purification was carried out using the protocol as described in our labjournal , but slightly modificated. A larger culture volume of 1,6 L was used. The resultion pellet was resuspended in 20 mL TEMB buffer. The cell lysis was carried out this time using a French pressure cell (Aminco SLM Instrument) with a pressure of 5000 psig (around 345 bar). The cell suspension was homogenisated two times in the French pressure cell. Before the step of ultracentrifugation, the resulting pellet was resuspended in only 1,5 mL TEMB buffer.
→ The purification was not succesful, as you could not recognize a visible band in the gradient.

prkA
After recognation of the fact, that our pSB1C_prkA construct did not have the desired RBS, we wanted to see whether there is protein expression after induction of the construct ptac_prkA. Cultivation was carried out using the method of Cultivation for Expression of recombinant proteins . Protein expression was induced with 0,5 mM IPTG (final concentration). To verify the expression of the RuBisCo through SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF , samples were generated using the protocol for Fast Cell Lysis for SDS-PAGE.
Proteinexpression of ptac_prkA induced with 0.5 mM IPTG.
T7_sRNA:pfkA and ptac_sRNA:pfkA
We made a cultivation with our two constructs to see if there is a difference between induced, not induced and the wild type of E. coli. The cultivations were arranged in shaking flasks with a volume of 30 ml in 250 ml flasks at 37°C and 250 rpm. The induction was with rhamnose for the T7 promoter and IPTG for the ptac at an OD600 value of 0.6. The cultivation lasted 13 hours. We made 2 biological and 2 technical replica for each culture. We took two samples (1 ml) of each biological replica for HPLC analysis that followed.
