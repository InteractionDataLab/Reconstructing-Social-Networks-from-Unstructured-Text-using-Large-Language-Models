Until now we didn't purified Inserts out of the gel if the backbone had another antibiotic resistence. We were using the PCR purification . But because it didn't worked out, we analyzed all our cut samples by gelelectrophorese. Thereby we discovered that the pSB1K3_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD has an illigal restriction side.
Because of the integration of RBS's between all genes in the alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD-Plasmid, a restriction side between alsS and a RBS occurs.
New primers were ordered: rv_ilvC_alsS-new and fw_alsS_ilvC-new

Week 4     09/22 - 09/28
pSB1C3_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD
This week the new primers rv_ilvC_alsS-new and fw_alsS_ilvC-new arrived. We tried to remove the illegale restriction side.
We tried different PCR amplification s to increase the chance to get a correct BioBrick. Therefore we amplified five parts for two combination possibilities in the Gibson Assembly:
fw_kivD_pSB1C3 , rv_alsS_pSB1C3 on pSB1C3_RFP
→ pSB1C3 with ~ 2200 bp
fw_pSB1C3_alsS , rv_ilvC_alsS-new on pSB1K3_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD
→ alsS with ~ 1800 bp
rv_pSB1C3_kivD , fw_alsS_ilvC-new on pSB1K3_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD
→ ilvC_ilvD_kivD with ~ 5200 bp
rv_kivD_ilvD , fw_alsS_ilvC-new on pSB1K3_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD
→ ilvC_ilvD with ~ 3600 bp
fw_ilvD_kivD , rv_pSB1C3_kivD on pSB1K3_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD

For the protein expression analysis of AdhA we made a cultivation . Samples were taken like explained in the cell lysis for a SDS-PAGE Protocol . Protein expression was induced when the culture reached a OD600 0,8 with rhamnose. The first sample was taken before the induction. Additionalle we took samples one, two and three and 20 hours later. Of these samples, we made a SDS Page
SDS page from pSB1A2_T7_adhA
The sizes of the AdhA is ~ 35 Da
GC-MS analysis of the isobutanol production
For the analysis of the isobutanol production we decided to use a GC-MS analysis. Because we will cultivate in LB medium, we made a calibration line with LB and the following concentrations of isobutanol for further analysis and quantification of our samples.
0,5 % isobutanol
0,1 % isobutanol
0,05 % isobutanol
0,01 % isobutanol
0,001 % isobutanol
Additionally we prepared GC-grade aceton with 1% 2-Butanol as an internal standard. >br>The samples were treated as described below:
Solvent extraction with 100µl LB-sample and 900µl aceton
5 min centrifugation
150 µl supernatant in the GC-MS vials for the analysis
The detection of isobutanol works for all tested concentrations but the 2-butanol peak was to high, so we need to do this again with 0.1% 2-Butanol.
