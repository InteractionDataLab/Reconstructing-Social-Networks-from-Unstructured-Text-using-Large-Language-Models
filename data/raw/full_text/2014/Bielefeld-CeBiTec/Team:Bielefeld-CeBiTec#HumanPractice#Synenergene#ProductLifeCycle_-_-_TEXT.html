Product life cycle
We asked ourselves how long our product will be competitive on the free market so we developed a possible life cycle (figure 1). During development of the product the amount of sales is pretty low but increases during the introduction to the market. At this state different car firms include the system into their car body and the amount of sales increases. In the growth phase many car producers sale the system within the cars. Additionally different power engines change their system to our producer system so that the amount of sales increases exponentially. At the stage of saturation the amount of sales decreases slowly. By changing the conventional mobility to electric mobility a strong decrease is perceptible. The invention of nuclear fusion will make our project dispensable for power stations. Storage of energy is not needed anymore but isobutanol will be further needed for varnish. The end of the system will be near if there is no excess of carbon dioxide or if storage of energy is not needed anymore. In contrast it seems that the project will not vanish this fast. A secondary advantage is the modularity of our project which allows to generate other products besides isobutanol because of its high adaptability.
In conclusion we postulate a technological lifespan of about 50 years for our project. This indicates that possible high investments into the development and finalization of our project will make sense. We are sure that there will be a big market for our application, especially considering the exchangeability of our product module.

After we estimated the feasibility of our project we thought about first ideas for a business plan .
