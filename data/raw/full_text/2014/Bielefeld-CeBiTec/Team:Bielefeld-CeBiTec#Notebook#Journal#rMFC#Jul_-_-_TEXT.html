Week 1     07/07 - 07/13
Week 1     07/07 - 07/13
FumA
This week we amplified the pSB1C3 backbone of FumA to use it for Gibson Assembly afterwards
PCR amplification of FumA ( pSB1C3_pre_Fum_A , pSB1C3_suf_Fum_A )
Annealing temperature: 55 °C
Bands are as expected (2070 bp)
FumBCD
This week we amplified the pSB1C3 backbone of FumBCD to use it for Gibson Assembly afterwards
PCR amplification ( pSB1C3_pre_Fum_BCD , pSB1C3_suf_Fum_BCD )
Annealing temperature: 55 °C
Bands are as expected (2070 bp)
PCR purification of backbones
Week 2     07/14 - 07/20
Week 2     07/14 - 07/20
Deletion of dcuB and integration of oprF into chromosome
This week we started the deletion of the fumarate/succinate antiporter dcuB and the integration of outer membrane porin oprF into chromosome using the Genebridge Red/ET-System
pRedET plasmid
Plasmid isolation of pRedET plasmid
oprF ( BBa_K1172507 )
Plasmid isolation of pSB1C3_BBa_K1172507
Week 3     07/21 - 07/27
Week 3     07/21 - 07/27
Deletion of dcuB and integration of oprF into chromosome
This week we amplified the pR6K-cassette and the oprF gene to connect them to each other. Additionally we transform the RedET plasmid into the E. coli strain KRX.
RedET plasmid
Transformation with electrocompotetent cells of the RedET plasmid into E. coli KRX
pR6K
PCR amplification of pR6K-cassette ( pR6K_dcuB_fwd , pR6K_dcuB_rev )
Annealing temperature: 55 °C
Bands are as expected (~1600 bp) but slightly visible
PCR amplification of pR6K-cassette is repeated two times
PCR product pR6K was purified out of the gel
oprF ( BBa_K1172507 )
PCR amplification of oprF for integration into chromosome ( porine_fwd_FRT , porine_rev_FRT )
Annealing temperature: 55 °C
bands are as expected (~1359 bp)
PCR product oprF was purified out of the gel
Agarose gel from colony PCR. As a Ladder we used GeneRuler™ 1 kb DNA Ladder from Thermo Scientific .
Connection of pR6K and oprF
PCR amplification to connect the pR6K-cassette and oprF ( porine_fwd_FRT , pR6K_dcuB_rev )
Annealing temperature: 55 °C
Bands not as expected because of too much template (~2900 bp)
Next time the PCR amplification was planned with a different usage of primer
additionally a new PCR amplification (as described further up) of pR6K-cassette and a new purification of it and oprF out of the gel was done
PCR amplification to connect the pR6K-cassette and oprF was repeated with the new purified pR6K-cassette and oprF and different primer usage
PCR amplification was initially performed 15 cycles without primer and afterwards 30 cycles with addition of primer
Week 4     07/28 - 08/03
Week 4     07/28 - 08/03
Deletion of dcuB and integration of oprF into chromosome
This week we connected the pR6K-cassette to oprF and amplified and purified both again seperatly
Connection of pR6K-cassette and oprF
PCR amplification to connect the pR6K-cassette and oprF
PCR amplification and purification of pR6K-cassette and oprF seperatly
