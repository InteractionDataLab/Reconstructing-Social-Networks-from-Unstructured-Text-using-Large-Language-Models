General
Week 1     07/07 - 07/13
Week 1     07/07 - 07/13
Transformation of the single deletions strains E. coli strains KRX ∆alr and DH5alpha ∆alr with the plasmid pRedET containg the Recombinase using the Genebridge RedET-System protocol .
Week 2     07/14 - 07/20
Week 2     07/14 - 07/20
Successful amplifikation of the oligonucleotide containing the flanking sites for the deletion of dadX using the primer BBa_K1465405 and BBa_K1465406
Purification using the gel extraction clean-up kit from Promega.
Transformation of the oligonucleotide containing the flanking sites for the deletion of dadX. The successful replacement of the catabolic alanine racemase was verified via kanamycin selection and Colony PCR ( dadX_Ec_control1 , dadX_Ec_control2 )
Annealing temperature: 55 °C
Bands as expected (3004 bp)
Resulting in the genotype DH5aplha ∆alr kan:dadX, while the dadX deletion in the KRX strain was not successful.
Week 3     07/21 - 07/27
Week 3     07/21 - 07/27
Week 4     07/28 - 08/03
Week 4     07/28 - 08/03
Transformation of the oligonucleotide containing the flanking sites for the deletion of dadX into the KRX ∆alr. The successful replacement of the katabolic alanine racemase was verified via kanamycin selection and Colony PCR ( dadX_Ec_control1 , dadX_Ec_control2 )
Annealing temperature: 55 °C
Bands as expected (3004 bp)
Resulting in the genotype KRX ∆alr kan:dadX.
