Week 1     10/06 - 10/12
pSB1C3_T7_adhA
This week we tried to reclone pSB1A2_T7_adhA into the pSB1C3 backbone.
Because the recloning didn't worked well till now, we decided to restrict the used backbone pSB1C3_RFP with EcoRI , XbaI , SpeI and PstI to minimize the chance of religation.
pSB1C3_T7_adhA we cut with EcoRI and PstI
Clean up and Ligation as explained in the BioBrick Assembly
Transformation with electrocompotetent cells
Colony PCR ( rev_pB1C3_adhA , fw_adhA_pSB1C3 )
Annealing temperature: 65 °C
Bands as expected (~1200 bp)
Liquid cultures for a restriction digest were prepared.
Plasmid isolation of pSB1C3_T7_adhA
Restriction digestion with EcoRI and PstI
Bands as expected (backbone: ~2,2 kb and insert: ~1,2 kb)
pSB1A2_T7_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD
This week we tried to combine the alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD construt with the T7 promotor.
BioBrick Assembly (Suffix)
Backbone pSB1A2_T7 (digested with SpeI , PstI )
pSB1A2_T7
Insert pSB1C3_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD (digested with XbaI , PstI )
alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD
Colony PCR ( fw_ilvD_kivD , rev_pSB1C3_kiVD )
Annealing temperature: 65 °C
Bands as expected (~ 7500 bp)
Liquid culture for a restriction digest was prepared.
Plasmid isolation of pSB1A2-T7_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD
Restriction digestion with EcoRI and PstI
Bands as expected (backbone: ~2,2 kb and insert: ~7500 kb)
For the protein expression analysis of AlsS, IlvC, IlvD and kivD we made a cultivation . Samples were taken like explained in the cell lysis for a SDS-PAGE Protocol . Protein expression was induced when the culture reached a OD600 0,8 with rhamnose. The first sample was taken before the induction. Additionalle we took samples two and four, 21 and 23 hours later. Of these samples, we made a SDS Page
SDS page from pSB1A2_T7_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD
The sizes of the included proteins are ~61 Da for the AlsS,
~54 Da for the IlvC, ~65 Da for the IlvD and ~62 Da KivD

alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD_adhA
Colony PCR ( fw_ilvD_kivD , rev_pSB1C3_kiVD )
Annealing temperature: 65 °C
Bands as expected (~ 17500 bp)
Liquid culture for a restriction digest was prepared.
Plasmid isolation of pSB1A2-T7_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD_adhA
Restriction digestion with EcoRI and PstI
Bands as expected (backbone: ~2,2 kb and insert: ~8500 kb)
For the protein expression analysis of AlsS, IlvC, IlvD, KivD and AdhA we made a cultivation . Samples were taken like explained in the cell lysis for a SDS-PAGE Protocol . Protein expression was induced when the culture reached a OD600 0,8 with rhamnose. The first sample was taken before the induction. Additionalle we took samples two, four, six, 22 and 24 hours later. Of these samples, we made a SDS Page
SDS page from pSB1A2_T7_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD_adhA
The sizes of the included proteins are ~61 Da for the AlsS, ~54 Da for the IlvC,
~65 Da for the IlvD, ~62 Da for KivD and ~36 Da for AdhA
Restriction digestion as a control
Agarose gel control restriction digestion from several constructs with the restriction. IB stands for pSB1C3_alsS_ilvC_ilvD_kivD. As Ladder we used a 1kb Ladder.
Week 2     10/13 - 10/19
Week 2     10/13 - 10/19
This week we made to cultivation for the proof of the isobutanol production.
The first cultivation was at 37°C and the second one at 30°C. During the cultivations we took severel samples for GC-MS analysis
