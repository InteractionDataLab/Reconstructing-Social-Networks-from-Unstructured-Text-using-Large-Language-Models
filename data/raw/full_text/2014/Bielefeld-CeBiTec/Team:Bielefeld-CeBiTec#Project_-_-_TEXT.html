Welcome to our project
With our project we like to address many different problems.
Our goal is to use electricity to create reduction equivalents like NADPH and to bind carbon dioxide to generate pyruvate with which we aim to produce high value products like for example isobutanol .
Feel free to look around to get several information. Note that the project is separated into three modules. For a better understanding look at our overview .
