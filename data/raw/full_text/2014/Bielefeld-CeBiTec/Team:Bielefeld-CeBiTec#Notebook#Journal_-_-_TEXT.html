Notes
PCR-Amplification: As the standard polymerase we use Phusion High Fidelity Polymerase
Plasmid purification: As the standard kit we use Promega Wizard® Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System
PCR and gel clean-up: As the standard kit we use Promega Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up
Colony PCR: As the standard kit we use Promega GoTaq® PCR Core System I

The team gathered up. We consist of ten persons from different fields of study in the masters program. The fields are informatics of natural science, bioinformatics and genome science, biotechnology and genome based systems biology.
A sponsoring team was build up pretty soon to start the financial part of our project. The first extra meetings were planned. We made a sponsoring folder as a giveaway.
Team Bielefeld-CeBiTec 2014 decided on a team color which is turqoise.

We started to plan a weekend for further discussions and to find a project
Our homepage was published with first information
An inlet was created with more information for interested companies
We added our 11th member Silke
For the public view we selected social media agents
First plans for policy and practices topics were made: We will participate at the pupils academy, at the NRW day, and some more
Project themes discussed this month:
Mangan-mushroom
Manganoxyde may bind metals
Interesting to clean the environment
Hydrogen peroxide is produced → no realization in bacteria possible
Clam glue
Fibers can be made uv resistent
Underwater hardening possible (30 seconds)
Expressed in E. coli 2008
Potential for clinical use
Earthquake sensing by toad (theories)
Toads messure radon gas before earthquakes
Toads have geomagnetism sensing
Toads react on full moon
Garbage reduction with bacteria
Regeneration of body parts (Axolotl)
Sea cucumber: Production of kollagen for cosmetics
Bacterial power cord
Production of clothes with bacteria
Photosynthesis with artificial plants via biofilm
Degradation of electronic scrap
CO2 fixation
Hydroxypropionate cycle
Carboxysome
Formiat
Sodiumpump for ATP production
Biocomputers
Degradation of cellulose to bioethanol
O2 production
Living antibiotics
Smog combating

We were planning the tour to LMU Munich where different iGEM teams of germany will have a meeting. We decided to give a talk about our project
Project themes discussed this month:
Biofuels
Biocomputing
Biomining
Smog drones / Smog combating
Sodiumpump
Light-driven proton pump
Living antibiotics
CO2 fixation
Nitrit reduction
Clam glue
Sea cucumber
April

We visited Merck and gave a talk about our project ideas
Our 11th member, Silke, left us because of her change of university
We paid our fees for iGEM and are fully registered
A group of students from the university of Bielefeld presented their labeling system  IceTag. It is only a prototype and we do not know if we have the chance to test it
We went to Winterberg were we meet up for the weekend to discuss our most promising topics. We talked about:
Phages
rMFC
Plastic degradation
Urban mining
CO2 fixation

We applied for Matlab licenses to do our modelling
The TechFak (Technical faculty) of Bielefeld University borrowed us three pipette sets
We supported some pupils of a biology advanced course of a local school by doing experiments with them. Later we helped them with an exhibition at a local museum, the museum of nature (namu), and gave a talk there. For more information click here .
A journalist of the WDR (westdeutscher Rundfunk) visited us in our lab and interviewed us about our work. He recorded sounds in the lab for his work "Leben leben" (living life) which will be transmitted in october. For more information click here .
We wrote an exposé for an application for the SYNENERGENE project which is initiated by the Rathenau Instituut
To present our team in the lab building we organized a barbecue
Some people of our team went to the LMU Munich to present our project idea at a meeting with some german iGEM teams.
We decided to synthesize some DNA fragments to optimize the codon usage for E. coli
