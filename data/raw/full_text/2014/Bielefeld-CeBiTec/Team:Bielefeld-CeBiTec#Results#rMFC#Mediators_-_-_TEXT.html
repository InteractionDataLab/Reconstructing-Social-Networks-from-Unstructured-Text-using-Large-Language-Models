Neutral red
Neutral red is a phenazine-based dye which has an suitable redox-potential to function as an electron-shuttle from the electrode to the cells.
Figure 1: Chemical structure of the triphenylmethane dye neutral red.
Bromphenol blue
Bromphenolblue is a triarylmethane dye that is similar to neutral red and also capable to function as mediator.
Cytochromes
Cytochromes are proteins containing a heme group. They are primarly responsible for the electron transport in the respiratory chain.
