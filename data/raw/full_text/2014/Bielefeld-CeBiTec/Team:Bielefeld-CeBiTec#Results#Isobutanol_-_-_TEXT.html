Module III - Isobutanol production
Overview
Alcohol dehydrogenase
Isobutanol pathway
Outlook
The aim of the third module of our project is the production of isobutanol in Escherichia coli, which was already shown by Atsumi et al., 2008 . We successfully implemented the pathway shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Schematic illustration of the isobutanol pathway ( Atsumi et al., 2008 )
We additionally showed the successful overexpression of all proteins via SDS Pages and the production of isobutanol in E. coli (Figure 2).
Figure 2: Comparison of the growth and the isobutanol production for cultures at 37°C.
BBa_K1465306 is the construct without the adhA and BBa_K1465307 the construct with the adhA. The growth is shown in black and the isobutanol production in blue
Here you will find information about the execution of our experiments.
