parts. A new application and/or outstanding documentation
(quantitative data showing the Part's/ Device's function) of a
previously existing BioBrick part also counts. Please see the Registry
help page on how to document your contributions. To fulfill this
criterion, you will also need to submit the part with its original
part name to the Registry, following the submission guidelines.

example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability,
social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property
rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least
one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it
allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team's
scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use
(within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative
approaches, and those that draw on past Policy &amp; Practice (formerly
Human Practices) activities. Link to page on your team's wiki:
