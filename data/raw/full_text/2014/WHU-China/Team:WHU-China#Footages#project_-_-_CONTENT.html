harm to human beings, especially whose house is newly decorated. And
to make matters worse, there are no effective and
non-secondary-pollution method to eliminate indoor formaldehyde. To
solve this problem, we developed a method of detection and removal of
indoor formaldehyde.</P><P>Using synthetic biology, we developed a method of detection and
removal of indoor formaldehyde, which can solve this problem without
secondary-pollution.</P><H2>Background: About Formaldehyde</H2><H3>Properties</H3><P>Formaldehyde is the simplest aldehyde. It is a highly reactive gas
and is formed by oxidation or incomplete combustion of
hydrocarbons. Formaldehyde exists at room temperature as a nearly
colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor. In its pure state,
formaldehyde is not easily handled, because it is extremely reactive
and polymerizes readily. The primary form of formaldehyde in dilute
aqueous solutions is its monomeric hydrate, methylene glycol
(methanediol) and the primary forms in concentrated solutions are
oligomers and polymers of polyoxymethylene glycols.<REF>[1]</REF></P><P>The physical and chemical properties of formaldehyde are summarized
in Table 1.</P><DIV class="image"><P>Table 1. Physical and chemical properties of formaldehyde</P></DIV><P>Formaldehyde is an important precursor to many other materials and
chemical compounds. In view of its widespread use, toxicity and
volatility, exposure to formaldehyde is a significant consideration
for human health. In 2011, the US National Toxicology Program
described formaldehyde as &quot;known to be a human
carcinogen&quot;.<REF>[2]</REF></P><H3>Applications</H3><H4>3.1 Construction and Decorative Products</H4><P>Since the invention of the particle board in Germany in the 1940s,
the use of formaldehyde in glues and resins has revolutionised the
construction industry. Formaldehyde-based resins allow wood chips,
sawdust and even some recycled wood waste to be combined to create
wood products that are durable, cost-effective and high performance
alternatives to solid wood. Formaldehyde-based resins also provide
better dimensional stability and mould resistance.</P><DIV class="image"><P>Figure 1: Formaldehyde in Construction and Decorative Products</P></DIV><H4>Automotive Applications</H4><P>Many 'under-the-hood components' such as fuel pumps, transmission
parts and brake pads are produced with formaldehyde-based
resins. Other formaldehyde based applications include the decorative
laminates of car interiors, engine lubricants, vulcanized rubber tyres
and lightweight polyurethane foams for automobile door insulation.</P><DIV class="image"><P>Figure 1: Formaldehyde in Construction and Decorative Products</P></DIV><H3>Harm</H3><H4>Toxic effects</H4><P>Formaldehyde is a highly reactive chemical that causes tissue
irritation and damage on contact. Formaldehyde concentrations that
have been associated with various toxic effects in humans show wide
interindividual variation and are route dependent. Symptoms are rare
at concentrations below 0.5 ppm; however, upper airway and eye
irritation, changes in odor threshold, and neurophysiological effects
(e.g., insomnia, memory loss, mood alterations, nausea, fatigue) have
been reported at concentrations ≤ 0.1 ppm. The most commonly reported
effects include eye, nose, throat, and skin irritation.</P><H4>Carcinogenicity</H4><P>Formaldehyde is known to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient
evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans and supporting
studies on mechanisms of carcinogenesis.</P><P>Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a causal relationship
between exposure to formaldehyde and cancer in humans. Causality is
indicated by consistent findings of increased risks of nasopharyngeal
cancer, sinonasal cancer, and myeloid leukemia among individuals with
higher measures of exposure to formaldehyde (exposure level or
duration), which cannot be explained by chance, bias, or
confounding.</P><P>Formaldehyde exposure is associated with multiple modes of action
related to carcinogenicity, such as DNA reactivity, gene mutation,
chromosomal breakage, aneuploidy, epigenetic effects (binding to
lysine residues of histones), glutathione depletion, oxidative stress,
and cytotoxicity-induced cellular proliferation (Lu et al. 2008,
Guyton et al. 2009, NTP 2010). There is evidence for a genotoxic mode
of action for formaldehyde-induced cancer; however, the mechanisms by
which formaldehyde causes cancer are not completely understood and
most likely involve several modes of action.<REF>[1]</REF></P><DIV class="image"><P>Figure 1: Formaldehyde in Construction and Decorative Products</P></DIV><P style="background-color: red">To detect and remove the
formaldehyde, we design and construct three systems to build our
Formaldehyde Terminator.</P><H2>Coloration system</H2><P> Since we would like to use formaldehyde as an input in our
design,can we find or construct a biobrick sensing the presence of
formaldehyde?  In Bacillus subtilis 168, there is an operon called
hxlAB operon.<REF>[1][2]</REF></P><DIV class="image"><P>Figure 1 The formaldehyde promoter shown in the red column</P></DIV><P>This operon controls the expression of two key enzymes in the
ribulose monophosphate pathway that are involved in formaldehyde
fixation, 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase and
6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase. <REF>[3]</REF> Expression of the hxlAB
operon is induced by the presence of formaldehyde.  HxlR protein can
enhance the operon to some extent. The hxlR gene that encodes HxlR
protein is located upstream the hxlAB operon.
</P><P>We get a part of the operon (which we name it P-formaldehyde,shown
in a red column in Figure 1) by PCR , add a fluorescent protein or
chromoprotein downstream and transform the plasmid(Figure2) into
E.coli DH5a. In this way, we can know whether there is formaldehyde or
not from the color change.</P><DIV class="image"><P>Figure 2 A GFP reporter is added downstream of the formaldehyde promoter</P></DIV><H3>The street cleaner system</H3><P>PADH, formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida is a
formaldehyde dehydrogenase which can oxidize free formaldehyde to
formate independent of GSH. <REF>[4]</REF> FDH, formate dehydrogenase
from Candida boidinii can oxidize formate to carbon dioxide in the
presence of NAD+.<REF>[5][6]</REF></P><DIV class="image"><P>Figure 3 The mechanism of two enzymatic reactions</P></DIV><P>We would like to use this two enzymes to degrade formaldehyde into
water and carbon dioxide.  In our design,the expression of this two
enzymes can be controlled by the P-formaldehyde so that the presence
of formaldehyde can induce the expression of them. We can also use
constitutive promoter to guarantee the expression level.</P><DIV class="image"><P>Figure 4 Two enzymes are added downstream of the formaldehyde promoter</P></DIV><H3>lysis system</H3><P>Lysis system has two important roles in our design.  One is about
biosafety; the other is to help the enzymes come out of the bacteria
so that they can work better in the environment.</P><P>We use Lux system, E7 protein and our P-formaldehyde to construct
this system.</P><P>Lux system is a quorum sensing system , consisting of luxI, luxR
and P-lux. luxI is a synthase for a small molecule called
acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL). AHL can bind to the LuxR protein and
then the composite can stimulate transcription from the right hand lux
promoter P-lux.<REF>[7]</REF></P><DIV class="image"><P>Figure 5 The mechanism of the lux system</P></DIV><P>The E7 lysis protein is a key component of the SOS response system
in E.coli and functions to export bacteriocins into the extracelluar
space under stressful environmental conditions. Besides, this protein
only has 47 amino acids and thus can be easily utilized as an modular
part in a constructed biobrick which helps the expressed foreign
protein easier to be collected or take effect outside
cell.<REF>[8][9]</REF> In this case, E7 lysis protein is used to
release enzyme FDH and enzyme PADH to the extracellular space so that
they can degrade formaldehyde in a more efficient way.We design this
system as following:</P><DIV class="image"><P>Figure 6 A system which can release two enzymes out of the cells when stimulated by formaldehyde</P></DIV><P>When the P-formaldehyde is activated, the bacteria will express
FDH, PADH and LuxI protein. LuxI synthesis AHL and AHL binds to LuxR
so that the P-lux is activated and the E7 protein is expressed. When
E7 reaches a certain level, the bacteria lyse.</P><H3>reference</H3><UL><LI>

and functional for others to use in both daily life and industry (this
is also a requirement for a good iGEM project), we have made a
device (see &quot;A Device for Daily Life&quot;) and got a detailed plan about
industrial application (see &quot;Devices for Industrial
Application&quot;).</P><H3>A Device for Daily Life</H3><P>We have made a convenient device(showed below) to hold our E.coli so that we can detect the formaldehyde gas easier. A electronic formaldehyde detector was added so that we can compare our detection system with it.</P><P>In our future work, we will combine this device with automatic
recording machine. By connecting them, we can get data automatically
and precisely. Then we will optimize it by diminishing its volume and
embellishing its appearance so that it can be easier to use.</P><H3>Devices for Industrial Application</H3><P>Although there still remains a lot for our project to come to be
used practically, we can hope that one day our dream can come true. As
we know from the information above, our systems can be used
separately; one way is that our Street Cleaner System can help to
clean formaldehyde from industrial effluent. But if we want to use it
in a higher efficient way, we may make use of engineering
machine. Here we show two possible devices:</P><P>The first one is Bacterial Board, we can see from DEVICE I.</P><P>This device is mainly composed by two semi-permeable membranes and
a container that contains bacteria, this device is inclined against
water direction, and this can limit the influence of deposition in
effluent to semi-membrane. Bacteria in container is access to culture
jar, it can keep flowing and provide bacteria with successive nutrient
and oxygen. It can be used to effluent that has low poison. After
setting series of these devices in an area of sewage duct, we can
clean formaldehyde efficiently.</P><P>The second one is bacterial windmill, we can see from DEVICE II,</P><P>The windmill has a lot of containers, these containers contain
bacteria, when the windmill rotates toward water direction, they can
contact effluent one by one, and then it can be above the surface of
effluent, it provides bacteria with chance to get both formaldehyde
and oxygen, bacteria can also avoid being submerged in harmful
effluence for long time, and it can also limit the influence of
deposition in water. This device can be used in high poisonous
effluence.</P><DIV class="printfooter">
