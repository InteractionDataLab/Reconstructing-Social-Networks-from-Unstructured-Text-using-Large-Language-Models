2014 registry and primers are design to PCR the target gene(the
sequence of the primers are shown below) BBa_B0034 is contained in the
upstream primer, which is a strong RBS.The plasmid pUHE21 is a
commercialized one that can be extracted from a modified strain of
E.coli(part of its sequence is shown below). EcoRI and PstI are used
to cut both the PCR product and the pUHE21 backbone. After
purification and ligation with T4 ligase, the reconstructed E7-pUHE21
plasmid is transformed into competent E.coli strain w3110. The
positive clone with right DNA sequence inserted is screened out and
referred to as strain E7</P><P>Sequence of upstream primer with strong RBS (BBa_B0034):

transformed into competent E.coli strain w3110 and the positive clone
is screened out, referred to as strain BB(short for backbone).</P><H4>IPTG induction and OD measurement</H4><P>Inoculate 3 Erlenmeyer flasks (referred to as E7-0, E7-1 and E7-2
separately) containing 100ml LB medium with 1ml of saturated overnight
strain E7 culture, and at the same time inoculate 2 Erlenmeyer flasks
(referred to as BB-0 and BB-1 separately) containing 100ml LB medium
with 1ml of saturated overnight strain BB culture. All of the broth
are cultured to OD=0.5, then IPTG is added to E7-1, E7-2 and BB-1 to
make their IPTG concentration reach 1.0mM, 2.0mM and 1.0mM,
respectively. After induction those 5 Erlenmeyer flasks are cultured
for another 8 hours, during which 3 samples are taken into a 96-well
plates from each flask every hours and their OD are measured with
microplate reader.</P><H4>Western blot to further prove the lysis effect of E7</H4><P>Besides OD measurement, we also do Western blot. Taken from each
Erlenmeyer flasks at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 hours after induction, those
samples are centrifuged ,the supernatant and sediment are used to run
a SDS-PAGE, then the antibody of DnaK(which is an endogenous protein
expressed constitutively in E.coli) is used to conduct a western
blot.</P><H3>Function Test of The Enzymes</H3><P>To test whether formaldehyde dehydrogenase (PADH) work or not, we
developed this system. In this system, when PADH oxidize formaldehyde,
electrons lost by formaldehyde are transferred to nicotinamide-adenine
dinucleotide (NAD+). Gaining electrons, the NAD+ are reduced to
reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH). By measuring
the absorbance of NADH under light of 340nm, we can know the
concentration of NADH, and finally know the activity of PADH.</P><H4>Culture</H4><P>Experimental group (E.coli with PADH gene) and control group
