Team WHU-China 2014
was born at the foot of the mount LuoJia, November 2013. The team is
mainly formed by sophomore and junior of the college of life sciences,
Wuhan University. Our team has a great tradition and this year is the
third time to join in the competition. In our warm small group, both
sophomore and junior work together. We hope that we can learn more
knowledge of synthetic biology and get access to more experimental
skills by ourselves during the competition. What is more important is
that we can make a contribution to the society. Let us join hands to
swim in the vast ocean of synthetic biology and find treasures one by
one!</P><P>Haoyuan Sun, as the captain of the team, is devoted himself into
the completion. From the establishment of the project, to undertake
the whole experiment guideline, he is just like a glaring star in the
night to guide us where to go ahead. In the iGEM team, he not only
uses his knowledge to solve the problems, but also encourages us by
his humor to get through the difficulties. Besides the iGEM, he is
skilled in playing ball games and telling jokes.</P><P>Hi, I am Zheng Sun, In the team of iGEM, everyone can find his/her
own place, and iGEM has different meanings to different people. As for
me, iGEM provides me with a great chance to explore the field of
synthetic biology and the way to go into the society to touch
different people and handle series of things I have never met
before. Thanks iGEM for giving me such a chance and I believe this
wonderful experience can leave me the beautiful memory and treasure in
my life.</P><P>Here is Yun Xue, this is my first year in iGEM. I joined iGEM
because I'm fond of synthetic biology and I'm skilled in the
mathematical modeling, genetics and molecular biology. And I would
like to pursue these interests in future and do research about
mathematical modeling of biological systems. I enjoy sport activities
such as badminton, tennis and basketball. I am lookng forward to
solving problems and getting good achievements.</P><P>Qiushuang Wu: the smart girl provided us with the original idea for
our project this year in the brainstorming. As the housekeeper in our
lab, she kept the lab organized when doing experiments. And she
herself did a lot of experiments, involving all parts in our
project. As some people's comment, she was always in the lab or on
the way to the lab. She usually says if love, please love deeply. She
loves biology very much, and will devote to her true love all her
life.</P><P>Long Yu, coming from Hubei, China, majors in biology in College of
Life Sciences, Wuhan University. In his second year, he entered into
the lab of Prof. Chen, whose field is microbiology. During those
times, he was mainly devoted to reveal a new kind of mechanism by
which genetic materials were transferred between Bacilus subtilis
other than three traditional horizontal gene transfer (HGT) ways. In
his third year, he participated in this iGEM team, and devoted much
time into it, so granted, he learned a lot. But it is a pity that he
could not keep it up. Now in his fourth year in college, he was
prepared to go to Monash University in Australia, conducting
researches about Tfh cells.</P><P>My name is Han Dong. I have been studying in Wuhan University for
more than 2 years, majoring in biology. I was born in a coastal city
named Qingdao, where I grew up with the sea, thus I like seafood,
beach and sea breeze. Sea makes me open-minded, willing and have broad
interests like swimming. I also enjoy reading and drawing, so I am the
main graphic designer in our team. I believe that painting will help
people to learn the world better by watching it carefully, and it is
the same with biology. That is why I join the team , I want to show
our idea with my pen.</P><P>I am Teng Li, a girl who loves reading and wants to make everyday
in my life meaningful. I regard being an iGEMer a happy thing that
deserves my devotion. All the iGEMers in our team are my friends and I
do enjoy performing experiments and exchanging ideas with them. It is
in iGEM that I learned how to cooperate, how to think and the basic
skills for doing research of synthetic biology.</P><P>Hello! I am Zhengyu Luo, a senior student major in math and I am
the computer engineer of the team in charge of the construction of the
webpage. I like art and design and I am full of energy and prepared
for any kind of challenges. Synthetic biology is a very hot subject
these days so I joined WHU-China to learn something about it. I
believe it must be a very interesting experience.</P><P>Hey guys! I'm Li Yuwenbin from Wuhan University, a team member of
Whu-China. My job in our team mainly focuses on proving the function
of E7 lysis protein as well as integrating it into our
formaldehyde-terminator system, so that those functional enzymes can
be secreted out into extracellular space to degrade formaldehyde more
efficiently.  Besides biological research, I have a strong passion for
various kinds of sports, like cycling, badminton and even x-game. I
also have a special taste for music, poems and animation. iGEM
jamboree has a lot of fun and it's so great to meet new friends and
exchange ideas with each other in the competition. See you guys at
MIT^ ^!</P><P>Hi there, this is Tianxing Zhai, a student of College of Life
Sciences at Wuhan University. As a team member of WHU-China, I was
responsible for the functional verification of formaldehyde
dehydrogenase (spectrophotometry), some molecular cloning, and other
non-experimental activities (e.g. ordering uniforms and badges). I am
interested in making science more interesting and more widespread. If
you and I are like-minded, please contact me. My Email is
txzhai@whu.edu.cn.</P><P>Hi, I'm Bei Liu. I was in the lab of proteomics in Wuhan
University. I did some experiments of biochemistry in the early
stage. I also helped Haoyuan in organizing the team and putting up
some ideas. Besides synthetic biology, I'm also interested in
proteomics and neurogenesis. Now I'm doing an internship in UT
Southwestern medical center in Dallas. It is really cool to
participate in the giant jamboree in Boston, because Dallas is just
like a large valley, while Boston is the true Big City. I hope I could
spend some time visiting the city in the spare time during the
jamboree.</P><P>I am Yao Chen, I still remember the first time I knew something
nabout iGEM when I was a freshman, my classmate joined this team
whereas I could only listen to his proud talking. Until last November
I participated in the iGEM team for my dream. We experienced the hard
Saturday night brainstorming and staying up late for presentation of
our project and finally our sub-team project became the only project
in the team. First I even could not understand what we would do but
thanks for the team members, I made it clear ultimately.  To
retrospect the last 10 months we went through the hardness and success
which enrich my experience, broaden my horizon and give me
friends. Now I am placid to write the story between iGEM and me and
appreciate all the people helped us.</P><P>I am Shuohui Liu. During the four years in university, one could
choose to sit around and achieve nothing. Or one could treasure the
time to do something meaningful. The most meaningful thing for me is
to join the iGEM. In the iGEM, one could do researches that are really
special and interesting. One could also make friends and work in a
team efficiently and comfortably. What's more, one could enjoy the
best time in the life. In other words, the one in the iGEM is the most
fortunate one in the word. Absolutely, I'm a guy like that.</P><P>Zhengwei Yuan| Senior in Biological Sciences Zhengwei is
responsible for the separation of FDH (Formate dehydrogenase) gene
from Candida boidinii which was bought from China Center of Industrial
Culture Collection (CICC) and he work so hard with our team leader
that they stay up late for three consecutive days to do the
experiment. The main driving force of their diligence is the love for
the iGEM and members in our team!  </P><P>I joined iGEM-team at my second year of colleague. I chose
life-science and wished to learn how to design a new life by
myself. iGEM gives me the chance to know more and do more. Ideas will
never appear suddenly - after the brain storm and layers of screening
we got the amazing idea finally and had a colorful life in the lab for
several mouths. I joined the human practice group at the last few
weeks and did some help. Thanks to my teammates and teachers, we
finished it quite well. I love dancing and reading novels. My favorite
novel is Harry Potter and I don't think it is childish. Life is
colorful, both in the lab and outside.</P><P>My name is Lei He coming from Wuhan University school of
pharmaceutical science. Because of my enthusiasm and teachers' help, I
have got a rich experience of experiment. But being an iGEMer of a
great team is the most exciting part.</P><PRE>NAME			 Shuang Liu

I'm grateful to be a member of this excellent miracle-making team. My
work in this project involves source gathering, plasmids design. I am
so glad that our idea and the outcome can now have a chance to be
presented to the world and let people know how the bioengineering can
create a formaldehyde toxicity free world.</P><P>My name is Ji Yang. I am a senior student in College of life
science, Wuhan University. It's a great honor to be a part of the
2014-WHU-China team. In the team, my responsibility is to assist Luo
Zhengyu to construct our web page and collect some necessary text
material. We would use some fancy CSS and JavaScript techniques to
make our page more attractive and more creative. I wish our work could
present you a clear and insight web page.</P><P>Qi Wang| Senior in Biology science Qi is really a shy and
introverted girl. She does not like to talk with other members very
much, but she is willing to be a good listener. A good team needs not
only someone who is eloquent enough to keep us together, but someone
who dedicated himself silently like Qi. And she is very serious with
her work. She worked in the lab for our project in the summer
vacation.</P><P>Hi! I am Man Li from WHU-China. I met iGEM one year ago and I am
totally into it. In my mind, iGEM is not a competition merely but a
club. In this club, students who have the same interests in
genetically engineering work together. We set our goals, and achieve
some ridiculous ideas. As for myself, I am an outgoing girl. For me,
research in biology is one part of my life. In my mind, the quality of
life is equally important to the achievement I make in biology. I play
violin in my spare times, and enjoy the peaceful afternoons. In
WHU-China, I am the one who mobilize the atmospheres in our laboratory
and cheer others up.</P><P>I'm Rui Bai, a senior student majored in life science, I'm so lucky
to be a part of our awesome WHU-iGEM. Before entering the team, I have
participated in a molecular biology lab for a year. Because of
curiosity, I joined in our team to broaden knowledge of synthetic
biology and share ideas with coworkers, which we called
brainstorming. Now I think it has been one of the most correct choices
which I have made in my college. What's more, I am good at organizing
activities for heading up the Student Union. And I also have an
appetite for drawing and basketball.</P><P>Xi Tu| Senior in Biological Sciences Xi joined the team, wondering
how synthetic biology works. He takes part in discuss the idea and
good at primer design.</P><H3>Instructors</H3><P>Zhaoning Wang</P><P>Tong Liang</P><P>Hangxing Jia</P><H3>Advisors</H3><P>Prof. Zhixiong Xie</P><P>Prof. Yu Chen</P><H2>Attributions</H2><OL><LI>
