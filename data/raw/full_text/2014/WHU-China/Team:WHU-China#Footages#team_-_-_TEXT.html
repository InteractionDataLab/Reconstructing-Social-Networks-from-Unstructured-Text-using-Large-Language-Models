Members
Hello everyone, Here is the team of WHU-China!  Team WHU-China 2014 was born at the foot of the mount LuoJia, November 2013. The team is mainly formed by sophomore and junior of the college of life sciences, Wuhan University. Our team has a great tradition and this year is the third time to join in the competition. In our warm small group, both sophomore and junior work together. We hope that we can learn more knowledge of synthetic biology and get access to more experimental skills by ourselves during the competition. What is more important is that we can make a contribution to the society. Let us join hands to swim in the vast ocean of synthetic biology and find treasures one by one!
Haoyuan Sun, as the captain of the team, is devoted himself into the completion. From the establishment of the project, to undertake the whole experiment guideline, he is just like a glaring star in the night to guide us where to go ahead. In the iGEM team, he not only uses his knowledge to solve the problems, but also encourages us by his humor to get through the difficulties. Besides the iGEM, he is skilled in playing ball games and telling jokes.
Hi, I am Zheng Sun, In the team of iGEM, everyone can find his/her own place, and iGEM has different meanings to different people. As for me, iGEM provides me with a great chance to explore the field of synthetic biology and the way to go into the society to touch different people and handle series of things I have never met before. Thanks iGEM for giving me such a chance and I believe this wonderful experience can leave me the beautiful memory and treasure in my life.
Here is Yun Xue, this is my first year in iGEM. I joined iGEM because I'm fond of synthetic biology and I'm skilled in the mathematical modeling, genetics and molecular biology. And I would like to pursue these interests in future and do research about mathematical modeling of biological systems. I enjoy sport activities such as badminton, tennis and basketball. I am lookng forward to solving problems and getting good achievements.
Qiushuang Wu: the smart girl provided us with the original idea for our project this year in the brainstorming. As the housekeeper in our lab, she kept the lab organized when doing experiments. And she herself did a lot of experiments, involving all parts in our project. As some people's comment, she was always in the lab or on the way to the lab. She usually says if love, please love deeply. She loves biology very much, and will devote to her true love all her life.
Long Yu, coming from Hubei, China, majors in biology in College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University. In his second year, he entered into the lab of Prof. Chen, whose field is microbiology. During those times, he was mainly devoted to reveal a new kind of mechanism by which genetic materials were transferred between Bacilus subtilis other than three traditional horizontal gene transfer (HGT) ways. In his third year, he participated in this iGEM team, and devoted much time into it, so granted, he learned a lot. But it is a pity that he could not keep it up. Now in his fourth year in college, he was prepared to go to Monash University in Australia, conducting researches about Tfh cells.
My name is Han Dong. I have been studying in Wuhan University for more than 2 years, majoring in biology. I was born in a coastal city named Qingdao, where I grew up with the sea, thus I like seafood, beach and sea breeze. Sea makes me open-minded, willing and have broad interests like swimming. I also enjoy reading and drawing, so I am the main graphic designer in our team. I believe that painting will help people to learn the world better by watching it carefully, and it is the same with biology. That is why I join the team , I want to show our idea with my pen.
I am Teng Li, a girl who loves reading and wants to make everyday in my life meaningful. I regard being an iGEMer a happy thing that deserves my devotion. All the iGEMers in our team are my friends and I do enjoy performing experiments and exchanging ideas with them. It is in iGEM that I learned how to cooperate, how to think and the basic skills for doing research of synthetic biology.
Hello! I am Zhengyu Luo, a senior student major in math and I am the computer engineer of the team in charge of the construction of the webpage. I like art and design and I am full of energy and prepared for any kind of challenges. Synthetic biology is a very hot subject these days so I joined WHU-China to learn something about it. I believe it must be a very interesting experience.
Hey guys! I'm Li Yuwenbin from Wuhan University, a team member of Whu-China. My job in our team mainly focuses on proving the function of E7 lysis protein as well as integrating it into our formaldehyde-terminator system, so that those functional enzymes can be secreted out into extracellular space to degrade formaldehyde more efficiently.  Besides biological research, I have a strong passion for various kinds of sports, like cycling, badminton and even x-game. I also have a special taste for music, poems and animation. iGEM jamboree has a lot of fun and it's so great to meet new friends and exchange ideas with each other in the competition. See you guys at MIT^ ^!
Hi there, this is Tianxing Zhai, a student of College of Life Sciences at Wuhan University. As a team member of WHU-China, I was responsible for the functional verification of formaldehyde dehydrogenase (spectrophotometry), some molecular cloning, and other non-experimental activities (e.g. ordering uniforms and badges). I am interested in making science more interesting and more widespread. If you and I are like-minded, please contact me. My Email is txzhai@whu.edu.cn.
Hi, I'm Bei Liu. I was in the lab of proteomics in Wuhan University. I did some experiments of biochemistry in the early stage. I also helped Haoyuan in organizing the team and putting up some ideas. Besides synthetic biology, I'm also interested in proteomics and neurogenesis. Now I'm doing an internship in UT Southwestern medical center in Dallas. It is really cool to participate in the giant jamboree in Boston, because Dallas is just like a large valley, while Boston is the true Big City. I hope I could spend some time visiting the city in the spare time during the jamboree.
I am Yao Chen, I still remember the first time I knew something nabout iGEM when I was a freshman, my classmate joined this team whereas I could only listen to his proud talking. Until last November I participated in the iGEM team for my dream. We experienced the hard Saturday night brainstorming and staying up late for presentation of our project and finally our sub-team project became the only project in the team. First I even could not understand what we would do but thanks for the team members, I made it clear ultimately.  To retrospect the last 10 months we went through the hardness and success which enrich my experience, broaden my horizon and give me friends. Now I am placid to write the story between iGEM and me and appreciate all the people helped us.
I am Shuohui Liu. During the four years in university, one could choose to sit around and achieve nothing. Or one could treasure the time to do something meaningful. The most meaningful thing for me is to join the iGEM. In the iGEM, one could do researches that are really special and interesting. One could also make friends and work in a team efficiently and comfortably. What's more, one could enjoy the best time in the life. In other words, the one in the iGEM is the most fortunate one in the word. Absolutely, I'm a guy like that.
Zhengwei Yuan| Senior in Biological Sciences Zhengwei is responsible for the separation of FDH (Formate dehydrogenase) gene from Candida boidinii which was bought from China Center of Industrial Culture Collection (CICC) and he work so hard with our team leader that they stay up late for three consecutive days to do the experiment. The main driving force of their diligence is the love for the iGEM and members in our team!
I joined iGEM-team at my second year of colleague. I chose life-science and wished to learn how to design a new life by myself. iGEM gives me the chance to know more and do more. Ideas will never appear suddenly - after the brain storm and layers of screening we got the amazing idea finally and had a colorful life in the lab for several mouths. I joined the human practice group at the last few weeks and did some help. Thanks to my teammates and teachers, we finished it quite well. I love dancing and reading novels. My favorite novel is Harry Potter and I don't think it is childish. Life is colorful, both in the lab and outside.
My name is Lei He coming from Wuhan University school of pharmaceutical science. Because of my enthusiasm and teachers' help, I have got a rich experience of experiment. But being an iGEMer of a great team is the most exciting part.

Hi I'm Chen Xi or you can call me Fred. As a senior year student, I'm grateful to be a member of this excellent miracle-making team. My work in this project involves source gathering, plasmids design. I am so glad that our idea and the outcome can now have a chance to be presented to the world and let people know how the bioengineering can create a formaldehyde toxicity free world.
My name is Ji Yang. I am a senior student in College of life science, Wuhan University. It's a great honor to be a part of the 2014-WHU-China team. In the team, my responsibility is to assist Luo Zhengyu to construct our web page and collect some necessary text material. We would use some fancy CSS and JavaScript techniques to make our page more attractive and more creative. I wish our work could present you a clear and insight web page.
Qi Wang| Senior in Biology science Qi is really a shy and introverted girl. She does not like to talk with other members very much, but she is willing to be a good listener. A good team needs not only someone who is eloquent enough to keep us together, but someone who dedicated himself silently like Qi. And she is very serious with her work. She worked in the lab for our project in the summer vacation.
Hi! I am Man Li from WHU-China. I met iGEM one year ago and I am totally into it. In my mind, iGEM is not a competition merely but a club. In this club, students who have the same interests in genetically engineering work together. We set our goals, and achieve some ridiculous ideas. As for myself, I am an outgoing girl. For me, research in biology is one part of my life. In my mind, the quality of life is equally important to the achievement I make in biology. I play violin in my spare times, and enjoy the peaceful afternoons. In WHU-China, I am the one who mobilize the atmospheres in our laboratory and cheer others up.
I'm Rui Bai, a senior student majored in life science, I'm so lucky to be a part of our awesome WHU-iGEM. Before entering the team, I have participated in a molecular biology lab for a year. Because of curiosity, I joined in our team to broaden knowledge of synthetic biology and share ideas with coworkers, which we called brainstorming. Now I think it has been one of the most correct choices which I have made in my college. What's more, I am good at organizing activities for heading up the Student Union. And I also have an appetite for drawing and basketball.
Xi Tu| Senior in Biological Sciences Xi joined the team, wondering how synthetic biology works. He takes part in discuss the idea and good at primer design.
