Smell the roses
BBa_K1403003 - Limonene synthase Limonene syntheses enzyme converts farnesyl-diphosphate to (+)-limonene, which is a component of lemon scent.
BBa_K1403006 - Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase catalyzes the formation of methyl jasmonate from jasmonic acid.
BBa_K1403009 - bmst1 BMST1 enzyme that catalyzes production of methyl salicylate from salicylic acid. Methyl salicylate has a wintergreen smell. It laso produces floral smell (Methyl benzoate) from Benzoic acid.
BBa_K1403012 - alcohol acetyltransferase I This enzyme converts isoamyl alcohol to isoamyl acetate producing banana odor.
BBa_K1403013 - Germacradienol/germacrene D synthase This enzyme produces Geosmin (rain smell) from farnesyl diphosphate.
BBa_K1403017 - aldB AldB stimulates acetolactate decarboxylase activities to transform acetolactate to acetoin, which smells like butter.
BBa_K1403019 - ilvBN ilvBN gene encodes for acetolactate synthase process. We used it to increase basal production of acetolactate, which serves as precursor for acetoin production.
Something fishy
BBa_K1403015 - Trimethylamine monooxygenase Trimethylamine monooxygenase enzyme degrades Trimethylamine (fish odor) into non-smelly compund. It also produces indigo (blue pigment) form  tryptophan.
Don't sweat it
BBa_K1403018 - agaA AgaA is a gene present in Corynebacterium striatum and it is the main responsible for body odor. It transforms 3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid into 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid which smells like sweat.
Interlab study
BBa_K1403000 - GFP under strong promoter in pSB1C3 Measurment kit test of Part: BBa_J23101 in pSB1C3. This part is a tween of BBa_I20260 but in a high copy pSB1C3 plasmid.
BBa_J23101 BBa_K1403000 - GFP generator under a weak promoter in pSB1C3 Measurment kit test of BBa_J23115 in pSB1C3. It is placed in a high coply plasmid,the GFP expression is under a weak Anderson promoter.
