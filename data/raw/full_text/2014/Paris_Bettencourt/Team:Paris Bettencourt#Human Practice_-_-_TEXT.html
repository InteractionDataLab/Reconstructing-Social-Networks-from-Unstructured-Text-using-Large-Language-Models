MOOC
Sharing is caring! We made a series of educational MOOCs aimed at high school students to help inspire them to come up with their own projects and start their own iGEM team.
CITIZEN SCIENCE
We collaborated with more than 600 citizens on our project. They had an opportunity to sample and analyze the data from their own body and learn about synthetic biology.
MINDER
We created Minder, a location based mobile app to help people get in contact to share ideas and create projects.
THE SENSE OF SMELL
Some facts about the human sense of smell and the way we sense the odor.
THE HUMAN MICRIOBIOME
Some facts about the human microbiome.
Our Practices project of this year is focused on Citizen Science: how to involve nonprofesional scientists in Synthetic Biology projects; MOOC, a Massive Open Online Course on iGEM and synthetic biology for high schools and Minder, an app to connect ideas.
