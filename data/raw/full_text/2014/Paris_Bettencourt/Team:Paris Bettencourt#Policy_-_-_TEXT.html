SAFETY
All the safety rules we followed in the lab, the training we received and the safety information about the bacteria we used.
CONSENT FORM
Why did we write a consent form? How did we go with it? And what is it like now?
PATENTING
Ever since patent law was established, it was constantly challenged and modified to suit the need of new industries. Nowadays, biotechnology is the new industry making patenting especially confusing. Here, we include our struggle with potential patenting related to our project.
The policy part is a record of our research in safety, bio policy and patenting law. In the process, we evaluated the biosafety issues in our project, wrote a consent form and collected information for patenting bacteria.
