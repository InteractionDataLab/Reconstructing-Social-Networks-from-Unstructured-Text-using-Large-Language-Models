Teen Spirit
-Created BioBricks coding for sequences for different enzymes to nullify the bad odor produced by E. coli. -We produced the smells that compose the main odor categories perceived by humans. -BioBricks submitted to be BioBrick registry:BBa_K1403003, BBa_K1403006, BBa_K1403009, BBa_K1403012, BBa_K1403017, BBa_K1403019
Smell The Roses -Isolated 4 bacterial species capable of growing on 2-nonenal as a carbon source. -Determined the critical smell detection limit of 2-nonenal. -Analyzed 2-nonenal tolerance and degradation in natural isolates.
Goody Two Shoes
-Demonstrated that mutant strains of B. subtilis produce less odor. -Measured growth and viability of mutants in synthetic sweat media and on socks.
Something Fishy -Cloned tmm into E.coli using pSB1C3 and pSEVA315 vectors, creating a new Biobrick: BBa_K1403015. -Characterized and quantified the activity of TMM by a colorimetric assay. -Confirmed the degradation of trimethylamine by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC/MS).
Don't Sweat It
-Expressed the odor gene agaA in E. coli (BBa_K1403002). -Designed and used CRISPRs to enrich for loss-of-function mutants 1000x in a mixed population. -Identified potential CRISPR targets as odor genes with variability hotspots in metagenome data. -Formulated a simple skin cream encorporating live bacteria.
Interlab study
-Successfully built the three devices -Sequenced and gel verified the three devices -Characterised all the three devices with the OD600 and fluorescence measurements in a Tecan micro-plate reader-Reported the results on the Interlab Study page of the iGEM wiki -Completed the description of the BBa_I20260 (Device 1) -Submitted and send parts: BBa_K1403000 (Device 2) and BBa_K1403001 (Device 3) to the Biobricks registry
Collaborations
The Smell Game The web platform continues to evolve, mostly thanks to the people who give their samples and play the game. At this time, users can give a sample of his own sweat, play with the samples of others and then obtain a position of their smell.The SmellGame project relies on a web platform available here :  http://smellofus.synbio4all.org. Join us and play!
Human practice
MOOC -Created a MOOC with 21 lessons to help high school students build a team. -More than 50 people annotated text in Genius and 15 teachers will use the tool next year. -20 organizations and iGEM teams around the world have agreed to promote it. -A student club was created in CRI (Paris) to continue the support for MOOC iGEM HS. Citizen science -More than 600 citizen scientists participated. -Developing a Smell game for sample analysis -Living lab event in Cite de Sciences et de l'Industrie. -Watching a scary movie had little to no affect on body odor intensity.
