OUR TEAM
We are iGEM Colombia Team, we are students from Universidad         de los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia and this is our fourth year in         the iGEM Competition.
In 2012 the team won the Regional Jamboree with a bacteria         capable of detecting a phytopathogen and alerting the plant of its         presence. Students from biological sciences, medicine, physics,         chemistry, computer and chemical engineering comprise our         team. We have students from different ages: we have master         students that help the smaller ones to learn the techniques and         undergraduate students that go from freshman to senior year.
OUR PROJECT
Cholera, caused by the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae, has     been a scourge to civilizations the world over since ancient times.     Our project aims to use synthetic biology to develop a V. cholerae     sensor using a new technique. We propose detecting V. cholerae’s     species-specific quorum sensing molecule. If we rewire V.     cholerae’s own quorum sensing mechanism in a harmless E. coli     chassis, we can build a biosensor that gives a color output when it     senses the pathogen.
We have finished our deterministic model, but we still have     problems with the parameters , as usual. At the lab we just finished     InterLab parts and 3 biobricks of our own project … we are still     working on more parts, specially Tetracycline Repressor from the     registry, which has a strange molecular weight.
We also had a Bake Sale this week and collected funds to go to     the Jamboree. At our HP practices project we have received a lot     of collaboration from many teams. THANK YOU SO MUCH. If you     want to know what we are doing and want to collaborate, contact     us.
Our system is based in a phosphorylation cascade that is reversed     in the presence of an Auto inductor (CAI-1). When there is V.     Cholerae in the media CqsS senses it and changes it functions     to phosphase. CqsS takes the phosphate from LuxU, which takes     the phosphate from LuxO and turns off the production of TetR     (Repressor of pTet). This process allows the production of the     signal Amilcp and the activator TetA ,creating a positive feedback.

PROJECT UPGRADE
Mosaicoli aims to investigate emergence of complex patterns by      engineering a cellular automaton in bacteria. The design of our      system was only a first step. While the wet lab worked hard to      assemble our constructs, the dry lab focused on the deterministic      model and its parameters. Finally, this week, we began to do our      first experiments. They concern the quorum sensing module of      our system. After fitting our deterministic model with the first      results, we aim to investigate cross-talk between different AHLs      and their diffusion.

PROJECT UPGRADE
We selected different surface proteins from Candida albicans,      Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans, Candida glabrata,      Toxoplasma gondii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and amplified      them via PCR, avoiding glycosilated regions.
So far, we have 18 amplified genes of interest, six of which are      cloned in yeast and the rest is still in the sequencing stage. After      the first round of the yeast two-hybrid assay, we have found some      peptides that potentially bind the six genes cloned in yeast, which      will be further tested for confirmation. We have also constructed a      new peptide library.We presented these results at the symposium      of the Goettingen Center for Molecular Biosciences and received      feedback from the researchers of the institute.Now we are      organizing the SynBio Day in our city on the 15th of August,      following what was discussed at the team meetup held in Munich:      we will have a boot in the city center of Goettingen where we will      talk to pedestrians and answer the questions they may have about      synthetic biology. We will also have some activities where people      can win some prices from one of our sponsors.
Many biochemical and biological events can take place when two      molecules interact with each other. Our screening method is,      generally speaking, a way to find new molecules with potential      biological applications. This pipeline should allow other researchers      to select novel biological parts that interact with their protein(s) of      interest, and which can be further refined to increase specificity      and modified to add functionalities.In our project, the selected      peptides will be attached to a fluorescent tag and submitted to      the biological part registry. However, the modifications are not      restricted to a fluorescent tag: radioactively labeled compounds,      attachment of different functional groups and immunoactive tags,      among others, are also options that can be explored.

LIKA-CESAR-BRASIL
OUR TEAM
For the first time on the iGEM competition, the LIKA-CESAR-BRASIL      Team is a mix of students from different areas of knowledge.
The      formation of the team started with the willingness to innovate within      the biology field of students of Laboratory of Immunopathology Keizo      Asami (LIKA) and the Center for Advanced Studies and Systems of      Recife (CESAR), which includes the participation of members from      both institutes.
OUR PROJECT
The association LIKA-CESAR-BRASIL Team will show the     competition an innovative project of biosensors for early     detection of breast cancer.
According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the     most frequent type of cancer among the women worldwide, both in     developing as well as developed countries. Most deaths from this     disease occur in low and middle income, because the patients are     diagnosed in advanced stages of the disease. Besides the delay     in detecting the tumor, often the resolution on the most effective     treatment is compromised by lack of technical and accurate     diagnostic system. Currently, the diagnosis occurs using image techniques such     mammography and magnetic resonance, which is very expensive     and not portable. One way out of this problem would be the use of     biosensors. This technology is capable of diagnosing infectious     diseases, genetic, metabolic and others. A biosensor is a device that     incorporates a biological element with a physical transudor to generate     a measurable signal proportional to the analyte concentration. Joining LIKA’s scientific experience with C.E.S.A.R.’s technological     skills, a the multidisciplinary team is developing a biosensor for the     detection of breast cancer with the help of robotics. The idea is to build     a system, which is able to process, and prepare small blood samples     in an automated mode through help of bacteria. This system will be     coupled to biosensors that are capable of detecting breast cancer     in its early stages. The goal is to shorten the analysis of samples     from patients that currently take 4-6 hours to less than 30 minutes.     The automation of the entire process, together with the creation of a     specific biosensor for breast cancer, will result in a future decrease in     deaths from the disease, due to a more rapid and effective treatment.

PROJECT UPGRADE
Plan for future steps:
This is a small scale experiment,      but it seems to lead us somewhere.      As part of our Citizen Science      project, we would like to project a      horror movie in a local cinema and      get at least 50 samples.
Movies project – How our mood changes of body odor     The aim of the project was to determine if body odor changes     with our mood. We also wanted to determine if a 5 minute clip     was enough to make a change in the smell or if it was necessary     to watch a whole movie.
We analyzed the odor of some volunteers before and after watching     a clip and a movie that showed a specific emotion –fear, love,     sadness, happiness. It was the first time they ever watched the     movie.
Before the clip, we showed a white screen during 30 seconds.     Volunteers were asked to relax and empty their minds. After the     clip, we showed a nature documentary (as it is supposed to set     us in a neutral mood state). Before the movie, a white screen was     shown again during 30 seconds.
Other volunteers smelled the samples and answered: How pleasant is the smell? (0 the least – 5 the most) How strong is the smell? (0 the least – 5 the most)
Results: Happy movie : Two people were asked to watch ‘Liar, Liar’. Results     are not very conclusive. The volunteers told us the movie was not     specially happy or funny.
Romantic movie : One person was asked to watch ‘ Love actually’.     After the movie, the smell is perceived as less strong and less     pleasant.
Sad movie : One volunteer watched ‘My sister’s keeper’. The smell     after the movie is perceived as stronger and less pleasant.
Horror movie : This is the smell of one volunteer, tested by three     different people. After the movie ‘The silence of the lambs’, they     all rated the body odor as less pleasant and stronger.
We repeated the experiment with another volunteer, and asked     two people to rate the smell. We had the same results. One person     rated the sample over the scale (6) for the question ‘How strong is     the smell?’ .

PROJECT UPGRADE
The last two weeks have been very motivational for all of us.     Our first provisional constructions for pheromones biosynthesis     have been prepared and already tested in plant, our first partial     results will come soon! In the meantime, multigenic and more     complex constructions are being developed for future trials.
We have started with the construction of a translator from     GoldenBraid (the assembly system we are using) to Biobricks,     so future iGEM teams can use our modules in Biobricks format.     A specific promoter for glandular trichomes is a few steps away     from being tested in plants and depending on the results, new     approaches will be used. The design of our cooper-activated     genetic switch is complete and we are waiting for the parts to     arrive so we can start building it.
We are also having some difficulties amplifying a gene we want     to introduce into our system to produce an extra pheromone.     Hopefully we will solve these problems soon so we can enrich the     #SexyPlant with even more features. Please summon the demons     of the failed PCRs and make them stop annoying us.
We started a collaboration with NRP-UEA-Norwich team to create     a common biosafety module, since both of our teams are working     in N benthamiana. Our biosafety module will have a male sterility     part, to prevent spreading of the genetic material, and identity     preservation part which will confer the plant a different color,     so it is easily distinguishable. This biosafety module will be fully     compatible with Biobricks, so future teams working in plants can     incorporate it in their systems.
Plan for future steps: We will test new, more complex multigenic constructions in N     benthamiana. Glandular trichome specific promoters will also be     tested with GFP in N benthamiana. Parts from NRP-UEA-Norwich     team and our own parts need to be adapted to each other in order     to build the biosafety module. We hope the last gene of our set of pathways is finally amplified     before the next newsletter is finished and that the translator is     finally built. The sooner the better. Stay tuned for our updates!

OUR TEAM
Our team consists of students from biotechnology major and bioinformation      major. The group formed when we got the information about the 2014 iGEM      competition in winter vacation. We have close relationship with other universities      in Shanghai, which offers us many chances to ask for help and assist other      universities.
OUR PROJECT
I can talk about what has happened in the last two weeks.
We did PCR with C. stercorarium as template to get gene of XynB.     Then we connect it to T-vector. So we can build some T-vector which contained our target gene. We     were using blue-white selection method for our experiment. The     experiment went well and we have cultivated some E.coli which     contained our target gene. We are going to do plasmid extraction     and splice our target gene from T-vector to the expression vector.     We also get some expression vector from another lab in our     college. However, the amount was not enough for our project. So     we did some common experiments to make it enough. Our project is about using an enzyme to biobleach paper pulp.
Plan for future steps: We need to build an expression vector to verify our expectation     and we will build vectors which is based on pSB1C3 for iGEM     submitting. We want to set up a line chart about the bleaching effect of enzyme     and the concentration of the enzyme. This task will be done by     GAO Jian. We also want to call some paper factories and take a visit. In that     case, We can find out what bleaching method is really being used     in manufactory. And we will study the cost-effectiveness of our     method.

Purdue
OUR TEAM
2006 was the first year that Purdue participated in iGEM, entering the      competition with seven undergraduate members and three advisers. Purdue      continued to compete for the next four years, earning bronze medals almost      every year but never anything more. Due to lack of interest, financial support,      and time, Purdue did not field a team in the 2011 iGEM competition. Fortunately,      the team was revived with enough interest and support to not only field a team      in 2012, but receive a gold medal and advance to the international competition      at MIT for the first time in the team’s history. In 2013, the Biomakers were ranked regional finalists with their project: “Back      to the Basics of Synthetic Biology”. They also received the award for Best New      Natural BioBrick, and advanced to the international competition!
OUR PROJECT
This year the Purdue iGEM Team is tackling the problem of global     malnutrition with our new project: Minecrobe! More than 870     million people are malnourished according to the United Nations     World Food Program, and the World Health Organization states     that iro deficiency is one of the most common and widespread     nutritional disorders in the world. We plan to utilize synthetic     biology to combat this problem by engineering Bacillus subtillus     to increase plants’ ability to uptake iron from the soil, through     production of plant phytosiderophores.
As the summer comes to a close, we’ve finished our main plant     control experiment, we’re working on optimizing our transformation     protocol for bacillus, and we’re waiting for our synthesized DNA to     come in. The goal of the plant control experiment was to find out     how corn and rice grow at different levels of iron available in the     soil. We had 48 corn and 48 rice plants grow in a range from 0%     to 150% recommended iron content, and grew them for 4 weeks.     We took pH readings, height measurements, and chlorophyll     measurements at regular intervals to gauge how the plants reacted     to the varying levels of iron. At the end of the experiment we took     leaf samples from each plant, and are planning on using ICP-MS     to quantitatively find out how much iron the plants had absorbed.     We’ll be able to use this data when we compare the plants grown     with our modified bacillus in the future.
Plan for future steps: In the coming weeks, are going to finalize our bacillus     transformation protocol and then transform our constructs     into the three strains we have in our lab. We then plan to do a     siderophore assay to confirm that our constructs are working as     expected, and then choose our final strain based on the quantity     of phytosiderophores being produced. Once we have chosen our     strain, we are going to start the final plant experiment to see how     our modified Bacillus affects plant growth.

OUR TEAM
Our team has participated in the last four iGEM competitions.
OUR PROJECT
With the exponential growth of interest     in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)     and their vast array of applications in     both space exploration and terrestrial     uses such as the delivery of medicine     and monitoring the environment, the     2014 Stanford-Brown-Spelman iGEM     team is pioneering the development of     a fully biological UAV for scientific and     humanitarian missions.
We are working to engineer cells to synthesize cellulose     acetate as a novel bioplastic, characterize biological methods of     waterproofing the material, and program this material’s systemic     biodegradation. In addition, we aim to use an “amberless”     system to prevent horizontal gene transfer from live cells on the     material to microorganisms in the flight environment.
So far, we have: successfully transformed Gluconacetobacter     hansenii, a cellulose-producing bacterium, with a series of     promoters to test transformation efficiency before adding the     acetylation genes; isolated novel waterproofing protein bands     present in wasp nest material; transformed the cellulosedegrading     genes into Escherichia coli; and we have confirmed that     the amberless construct prevents protein expression in wild-type     cells. In addition, as part of our human outreach project, we have     been in touch with leaders in the fields of UAVs, synthetic biology,     and earth sciences, and it is clear that biodegradable UAVs could     have a significant impact on the industry.
Plan for future steps: For the production of cellulose acetate, we plan to use directed     evolution to select for those organisms which produce the polymer     with highest acetate content.
For our wasp protein waterproofing project, we plan to transform     yeast with the genes for the cellulose waterproofing proteins and     run a high throughput assay to isolate the colonies that produce     the most water-resistant products.
Finally, for our biodegradability project, we plan to link the     production of our esterases and cellulases with a quorum sensing     time-delay mechanism.

Sheffield
OUR TEAM
We are an interdisciplinary team of eight undergraduates, consisting of      five engineers and three biologists hailing from four different countries.      We were assembled earlier in the year by five PhD student advisors and      having decided it was critical to tackle a real world problem, we asked      the general public what sort of problems they faced on a regular basis.      Many replies were made by people stating that they often had problems      with pipe blockages, and from there our project began.
We are the third team from Sheffield to enter the iGEM competition, and      the first since 2010. We are aiming for victory in the manufacturing track!
OUR PROJECT
The accumulation of fat and hair deposits in sewer systems is     increasingly problematic in urban areas, causing disruption to     the public and costing water companies a lot of money.
FOG (fats, oils and greases) pollutants mainly originate from     homes and restaurants, who dispose of used cooking oil down the     sink rather than in the bin. Our idea is to engineer E. coli to secrete     lipase and keratinase enzymes to break down these deposits     before the blockages have the chance to form.
Plan for future steps: We are working on methods of inserting the bacteria into the pipe     in a way that is both cost-effective and practical. We also intend to     research where the responsibility for dealing with damage from     environmental pollutants lies.

OUR TEAM
The iGEM team of SJTU is supported by Bio-X Institutes of Shanghai      Jiao Tong University, founded in 2009. We were the Grand Prize      Winner of Asia in 2012, and won Best New BioBrick Devices and      gold medals in the past five years.
Our team consists of undergraduates with biology background.      Make science and technology serve production more effectively      is our constent pursuit. This year, our team focus on protein      multimerization system in cytomembrane and we hope MembRing      can bring new ideas and greater efficiency to the relevant industrial      practices.
OUR PROJECT
Use recognition of DNA-binding     proteins and specific nucleic acid     sequences to achieve proteins     multimerization
Remold connecters(plasmids) to     achieve selective combination of     different enzymes
Explore the maximum number of     enzymes that can be connect on a     single connecter.
This year, we bring MembRing – an annular protein     multimerization system in cytomembrane.
This system will help us achieve the goal of selective polymerization     of enzymes. Polymerized enzymes, different from normal     scattered condition, has much more opportunities to contact with     the substrates. Therefore, our project aims to increase as well as     control the efficiency of complex reactions.
The basic function, polymerization, is carried out by a circular     DNA and DNA-binding protein to polymerize enzymes. First, a     fluorescent protein, a transmembrane domain, an enzyme and a     DNA binding protein are connected in order, forming a complex     that the FP locates outside the film while the enzyme and DNA     binding protein are in cytoplasm. Then integrate specific matching     DNA sequences onto an exogenous plasmid and co-transform     this connecter with expression vectors into E.Coli to associate     enzymes.
In addition, we plan to make the enzymes selectable by remolding     the connecter with different recognition sequences and cotransforming     it with expression vectors. This will help the whole     project to work in all kinds of practical applications. During this year, our team has already had many opportunities     to interact with other teams. We find those communications     inspiring to both sides. Thus, we welcome any kinds of comments     or questions. Let’s work together to ake this year wonderful!

We are passionate not only about science but also about educating      children and youth in Israel from all walks of life.
OUR PROJECT
With the exponential growth of interest     in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)     and their vast array of applications in     both space exploration and terrestrial     uses such as the delivery of medicine     and monitoring the environment, the     2014 Stanford-Brown-Spelman iGEM     team is pioneering the development of     a fully biological UAV for scientific and     humanitarian missions.
Detection of allergens and toxins in food and water is a very     important issue, which is difficult to solve, mainly because the     detection must be done at very low concentrations. Our team is     paving the path to a cheap and accessible solution to this issue     by planning a bio-sensor system that can accurately identify a     substance of interest at extremely low concentrations. We are programming E.Coli bacteria to sense the presence of a     specific substance and process the signal to produce a green light     as well as signal to neighboring bacteria to follow suit, causing a     chain reaction. This makes the green light visible to the naked eye,     alerting the consumer of the presence of the substance. Along the way, we plan to build (and make available to future iGEM     teams), many useful sub-systems which will include: a Histidine     Kinase two component signaling system (which will detect new     materials), 6 different double-repression toggle switches (along     with the proper characterization), a chemically synthesized     photo-switching molecule (activated by the green light produced     by the bacteria themselves) which can connect cells, creating a     synthetic biofilm, and a method of constructing genetic sequences     with Gibson addresses which will make the high-throughput     construction of complex biobricks possible.

UCSF & UCB
OUR TEAM
The UCSF iGEM program was created in 2007, with the belief that      students regardless of age could participate in synthetic biology.      This year, UCSF and UCB have combined forces to produce a team      composed of five graduates from San Francisco’s Abraham Lincoln      High School’s Biotechnology Program, two returning iGEM alumni,      two undergraduates from UC Berkeley, and one exchange student      from Peking University. While we all have different backgrounds      and knowledge, we are united in our desire to learn, contribute,      and succeed.
OUR PROJECT
Project update (It can be a subpart of your project), what has     happened, worked or failed in the past two weeks and why:     For teams that were not in the first issue, please try to give a really     really brief summary of your project.     Summary: In nature, many organisms must make multicellular decisions,     whether the cells are part of a community of unicellular organisms     or an organ in a multicellular organism. In some cases, the     decision reaches a consensus and all cells respond similarly, such     as in quorum sensing by some species of bacteria. Decisions may     also favor a diversified response, in which some cells respond     strongly to a signal while others are downregulated or cease to     respond. For instance, in the human immune system, even though     all T cells initially react to an antigen, only those with a strong     response proliferate and produce an immune response. Many of     these decisions are facilitated by a signaling factor, which the     cells sense and produce more of.
Our goal is to understand how a group of cells uses sense and     secrete communication to make a community decision. Therefore,     we have chosen to pursue the Information Processing track.
We are designing multicellular systems in which different yeast     strains communicate with each other to form a community     decision. By engineering systems in which strains with variable     initial responses develop the same response, or strains with the     same initial response diverge to develop a bimodal response, we     can model interesting communication systems, such as those of     the immune system, leading to more novel insights about how     cells interact to produce a specific response.

PROJECT UPDATE
In this week’s Newletter, we are going to use more graphs to      illustrate our ideas and process. If you have any questions or      advice, please just email us :)
This week, we have been invited to the iGEM Conference in Taiwan,      where we shared our work and results with many teams in Asia.      That’s a great trip and we learned a lot from this meetup!
This is the poster we used in the meetup which provides your more      details about our project compared to last Newsletter.
Currently, we are trying to figure out the optimum conditions of C.      Crescentus development, transformation and expression, which      will tell us how to develop the holdfast in C.Crescentus within      control. So, we can extract the gene regulating the expression      of holdfast in C. Crescentus and build parts with the regulating      system.
In the future, based on the current results, we will construct the      light sensing-response system. And furthermore, to guide the      accomplished system into E. coli and C. Crescentus as well as to      test the function and efficiency of ribozymes.
You may be curious what this little project can lead us to. Here is      our answer:
1. Plan the industrialization and further development in biological      imaging industry 2. Design the projector specialized for biological imaging
Do you have more excellent ideas about this topic? Welcome to      discuss with us!

Regardless of different personal traits and dispositions, we gathered here, in      Xiamen University, striving for a common goal; In spite of various setbacks      and difficulties, we united as a team, supporting each other and persevering in      iGEM work. The 2014 iGEM team of Xiamen University is a great one with over 20 members      at the present. We each, from a broad range of background, are dedicated to      explore the way how to utilize the synthetic biology to promote social progress      like seeking to address the environmental problems with a wiser biological      method and improve the public understanding toward such a subject. The      constitution of our team is sophomoric and junior college undergraduates,      among which former one holds the majority. As a youthful and energetic group,      we XMU iGEMers are clinging to various innovative attempts and expecting to      develop long-term friendships with other teams in different area sincerefully.
OUR PROJECT
This year, chemotaxis interests us a lot. We intend to reprogram     the strain (CL-1) which lacks the CheZ gene to form mathematical     patterns. CheZ gene belongs to chemotaxis family of E.coli, and     protein CheZ can dephosphorylate CheY-P which allows E.coli to     make smooth swimming. The ΔCheZ bacteria can’t dephosphorylate     CheY-P, therefore the strain isn’t motile until CheZ is involved in.     Based on this, the motility of E.coli can be precisely controlled by     stimulus (such as IPTG). We try to construct logic gene circuits to     make E.coli recognize environmental stimulation, thus by utilizing     the controlled chemotaxis which named pseudotaxis we could     command bacteria to form patterns such as ellipse, hyperbola     and so on. The intrinsic motivation that drive us striving for the above project     is that we want to simulate the process of stem cell differentiation.     In the organs development, stem cells differentiate while aggregate     together to form heart, liver and kidney what have precise shapes.     We think there must be some mathematical principles that govern     the differentiation process. By simulating differentiation, we     want to get a closer understanding of the differentiation process.     However, E.coli can’t sense as much stimulus as stem cell, we     intend to utilize RNA aptamers what has the potential to response     to almost all stimulus to cover that shortage. Thus, we can get a     more precise stimulation. We also try to utilize pseudotaxis to accomplish some experimental     meaning. As far as we know, the motile ability is proportional to     the amount of protein CheZ in certain range. By measuring the     average chemotaxis distance, we can get a precise evaluation on     the RBS efficiency which is evaluated by fluorescence strength     previously.

TEAM'S QUESTIONS
From Goettingen
To Valencia : Which insect pheromones are you using? To Paris Bettencourt : No doubt there are persons who may feel insecure      because of their personal odor and who will benefit from your project, but      it seems that you are categorizing a single and only kind of “malodor”.      It’s interesting to consider that the attitude towards body odor is a      culture-related trait. How can the concepts of “strong personal odor”      and “malodor” be defined in a multicultural context without any cultural      bias? Wouldn’t it be more politically correct to leave the users decide if      they have “malodor”?
From Paris Bettencourt
Would any other iGEM teams like to repeat our experiment? They would      project sad, happy and romantic movies in a controlled environment, and      analyze the sweat samples by smelling them and rating the strength      and pleasantness before and after.
From Valencia
How would you quantify the secretion of volatile compounds into the air? Would you use an alternative genetic switch to the cooper-activated one      we’re using? Do you think our biosafety module is safe enough? If not,      how would you improve it?
From NJU-QIBEBT
How to manage time for experiments. How to arrange different tasks for each team member.
From Purdue
Would you feel safe eating corn that was grown in soil with modified      microbes in it, even if there was no threat to your health?
From StanfordBrownSpelman
How would you use a biological UAV?
From Sheffield
Who should be held responsible for repairing the damage caused by      environmental pollutants (such as fats, oils and greases)?
From SJTU
How to build a fusion protein effectively? If your projects consider the use of polymerase system?
From Technilon Israel
What would you like our system to detect? What materials interest you?      How do you envision a home kit for material detection? What things      are important for you in such a product? Would you use a product with      bacteria at home? How but outside your home? What kind of safety measures would you like the product to have?
From UCSF UCSB
How can simple cell signaling be used to model complex signaling      systems on a larger level? How can we differentiate between different      cell strains when they are intermixed? What are some ways to get more      people interested in synthetic biology?
From XMU-China
We want to know that whether there is any easy methods to dye bacteria.      Why some parts of RBS can’t be transformed ? Could amino acid be      sterilized at above 120 degrees Celsius zero ? We want to form a complex      mathematic pattern through the chemotaxis of E.coli,dose it make      sense? In the absence of external forces, is that ture self-assembly      (self-organized) gene circuits can only form a circular pattern.
