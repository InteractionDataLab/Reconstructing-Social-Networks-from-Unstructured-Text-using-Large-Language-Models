Newsletter n°1
from July 28th to August 10th 2014
Hi, all the iGEMers. I am happy to announce the first issue of our newsletter. This biweekly newsletter is cofounded by Paris Bettencourt iGEM team and Xiamen University iGEM team. Currently, we have 9 teams participating and are expecting more for the later issues. The newsletter has two major parts: project update and team member introduction. The teams should be writing about one of the parts every two weeks. We hope that through this activity, the teams will be able to keep better record of their own projects, gain feedback from their peers and get to know other young synthetic biologists. There will also be special issues with interviews of iGEM alumni and past advisors from college teams.
This first issue covers the general information of both the project and the introduction of each team. It also includes a question component, which includes the topics that each team wants to get feedback on from other teams. We highly encourage everyone to think about the questions and provide insights. Please send your thoughts to one member of the team and we will collect them a week from today.
We wish the best luck to everyone competing in iGEM and hope this newsletter can be a valuable resource.

ETH Zürich
OUR TEAM
ETH Zürich is taking part to iGEM since it was opened to the     European universities (for the second edition).
The team has known several successes in the Information     Processing track of the competition. This year, we are seven highly     motivated students from different backgrounds, aiming to rock the     Information Processing track once again. The interaction between     wet lab and dry lab is crucial for our team.
OUR PROJECT Make a Sierpinski triangle pattern     appear in a grid     Conjugate quorum sensing and     logic gates in bacterial colonies     Implement an XOR gate in an E.     coli     Characterize integrases (retrieve     missing parameters)     Study quorum sensing mechanism     aiming to lower the leakiness     Be able to predict accurately the     system’s behavior.
Questions it raises : How can a complex pattern emerge from a     simple logic rule?
What is to be considered as simple or     complex?
How can leakiness, noise and lack of     robustness in biological systems be     handled?
Emergence of complex patterns in nature is a fascinating     phenomenon, which is not fully understood yet. Some sea snail     shells indeed present natural mosaics, made out of only two     colors seemingly following a simple rule to form a pattern.
Our project Mosaicoli aims to implement a similar complex     behavior. It challenges the high noise and the low robustness     shown by biological systems. This cellular automaton consists of     a regular grid of E. coli colonies. Either in an ON or OFF state,     each colony interacts with its neighbours according to a fixed logic     rule. Mosaicoli exploits quorum sensing, integrase logic gates     and microfluidics to generate the Sierpinski triangle pattern.     Communication between colonies is achieved by AHL molecules     and subsequent updates in a cell state are determined by a discrete     XOR integrase gate. The final state is read out via fluorescence,     which collectively depicts a complex pattern. Mosaicoli deals with     the leakiness of biological subunits to create a reliable complex     entity, which can be considered as a first step towards the biological     computer.

Goettingen
OUR TEAM
University of Göttingen, Germany.
We come from different countries: Germany, China, Iran, Lebanon,      India and Mexico. The group formed when the team of 2013 gave a      presentation of their work and how they did in the Jamboree (they      won the award for the best presentation in the overgrad division at      the World Championship).
OUR PROJECT
Questions it raises : Is it possible to select a short peptide with     affinity towards fungal surface proteins out     of a short peptide library?
We intend to develop a fast screening technique for different     invasive fungi, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans     and Aspergillus nidulans.
The idea is to tag the invasive fungal cells with a special protein     marker that allows an easy detection of fungi. By modifying the     protein marker with a proper signal molecule, we will be able to     accomplish a fast and direct elimination of invasive fungi.
We want to prove the principle that it’s possible to obtain short     peptides with affinity towards a protein of interest through a highthroughput     screening method. The proteins of interest in our project     are fungal surface proteins, but they can be any other protein, such     as tumor markers or other pathogenic microorganism surface     proteins.
We also want to develop a diagnostic tool with those peptides.     Here, our methodology is straightforward and it is mainly a proofof-     principle: we will tag a GFP marker and check for fluorescence.     However, if this is successful, in the long term and after other sorts     of chemical modifications, these peptides can be further applied     as diagnostic and even therapeutic tools.
We are running for the Health and Medicine track.

Gothenburg
OUR TEAM
The Gothenburg team is currently working in the Systems and      Synthetic Biology group, in the Department of Chemical and      Biological Engineering at Chalmers.
Our team reflects the diversity of Chalmers and the iGEM competition;      from the total of 10 team members, 5 of us are not Swedish, with      different nationalities such as Brazilian and Indian. We are all      students at Chalmers, mostly at undergraduate level, and with      different backgrounds. Being the second Chalmers iGEM team is      both challenging and rewarding. We are excited and inspired by the      experience of the iGEM competition and having fun while learning!
OUR PROJECT
Our team goal with the iGEM      project is to construct a yeast      generation counter. The idea is      that each time the cell divides      a different florescent protein is      produced. Therefore by examining      the cell under a microscope or in a      flow cytometer one can determine      how many times the cell has      divided.
Nowadays the determination of replicative age of yeast cells is     done by counting the budding scars of each cell in a microscope,     a process time consuming and not effective.
Our goal would be achieved by constructing a logical AND gate in     the cell where the input signals consist of a cyclin activated dCas9-     VP64 and a guide RNA (gRNA) signal from the previous cell cycle.     The output response consist of a different fluorescent protein and     a new gRNA molecule.
dCas9-VP64 is an engineered turntable transcription factor only     active when dimerized with an interchangeable gRNA molecule.     The gRNA also determines the specificity of the transcription     factor which enables the dCas9-VP64 to activate different     genes depending on the sequence of the gRNA molecule and     the promoter. gRNA consists of two parts, a scaffold and a 20     bp Specificity Determinant Sequence (SDS) on the 5’ end. The     scaffold constitutes the majority of the gRNA molecule and     gives it its structure whereas the SDS binds to the target site in     the gene promoter. Cyclins are proteins that are involved in the     progression of the cell cycle, therefore activated at specific times     [5]. To mimic the specific production pattern of cyclins the dCas9-     VP64 gene is placed under the control of a yeast cyclin promoter.     Therefore the Cas9 will be produced in the G1 phase. When the     Cas9 and gRNA dimerize and the transcription factor is activated,     it in turn activates the transcription of a new fluorescent protein     and a new gRNA molecule to act as a memory for the next cycle.     Once this age counter is implemented, it would be possible to sort     cells according to their replicative age automatically with a flow     cytometer device.

PARIS BETTENCOURT
OUR TEAM
Paris-Bettencourt iGEM team is part of the Center for Research      and Interdisciplinarity (CRI) in Paris.
It was the first French iGEM team, and has long history of success      in the competition. The team won the World Jamboree Grand      Prize Award last year with the Fight Tuberculosis with Modern      Weapons project. When deciding on a theme, above all else, we      value creativity and the potential of our project to benefit society.
OUR PROJECT
Treating strong body odor using     probiotics, producing a low cost     perfume produced by bacteria     and setting up a database of     microbiome correlated to body     odor
Questions it raises : What kind of regulation would you like to     see for GMO food/products?     (Ex: mandatory labeling)
Would you buy a perfume that is produced     by E. coli? If not, why?
What would you like to know about body     odor?     (Ex: does your body odor affect who is     sexual attracted to you?)
This year, the Paris-Bettencourt team has decided to explore a     topic that has rarely been approached by synthetic biologists in     this competition: odor.
We are currently working on several projects related to odor:     Engineering bacteria to produce an odor library     Designing probiotics and cosmetic products aimed to help people     with strong body odor. Treating genetic diseases leading certain persons to have strong     malodor. Launching a citizen science project aiming to correlate armpit     microbiome data with malodor.
As for human practice, we are focusing this year on open-source     biology and hope to get contribution from not only team members,     but also the public, through collecting samples, crowdsourcing     and updating of project development. At the same time, we are     building a MOOC course for high school students. As popular as     iGEM is above undergraduates and graduates, it is still quite new     in high school. This course will include an introduction of Synthetic     Biology, the social concern with it and work students through the     important steps to form an iGEM team. In addition to the scientific contribution to iGEM, we are aiming     at improving scientific communication and opening the project to     the general public. To facilitate open science the team is building     an online collaborative platform to involve citizen scientists in the     process. We believe, everyone has something to contribute to the     development of science!

Polytechnic University of Valencia
OUR TEAM
We are a team uniquely composed by students from the      Polythecnic University of Valenciawith the support of the Spanish      National Research Council. In this iGEM edition we dare to work      with plants and hope our work will encourage other teams to do      so in the future.
OUR PROJECT
Avoiding damage in crops caused     by pests, using pheromoneproducing     plants that disrupt     insects mating and therefore avoid     laying and damage caused by     larvae.
Questions it raises : In what fields do you think that using     Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)     could improve our lifestyle?     (Ex: Safer drugs production, bioremediation)
Would you accept using GMOs for noneating     purposes? If not, why not?
What do you want to know about crop     protection against pests?     (Ex: How do insects behave in crops?)
This year, our team is developing an environmental friendly     approach to control insect pests: The Sexy Plant.
The gist of the project we are working on is focused on the production     of insect pheromones in the plant Nicotiana benthamiana. Our     main efforts are aimed at avoiding the insect laying and the     damage caused by insect larvae in crops. Since pests are one of     the main causes of damage and the use of pesticides is getting     more and more unpopular due to their environmental effects, our     goal is to release the sufficient amount of pheromones into the air     to cause mating disruption among insects, thus, male insects will     not be able to find and mate with female insects, in the same way a     soldier dressed in camouflage is difficult to be seen in a rainforest.
As for human practices, we are creating surveys about GMOs and     Synthetic Biology in collaboration with other iGEM teams from     different countries. This way, surveys from all the teams can reach     a higher number of people with different regional culture, so the     results are more global.
We know the importance of an early introduction in science.     For that reason, we have carried out activities to increase kid’s     interest in science in our university summer school and we are     creating a project to increase interest in iGEM for High School in     collaboration with more iGEM teams.

TJU-China iGEM Team
OUR TEAM
Tianjin University IGEM team is one of the first entries to attend the IGEM      competition in China. We started our IGEM journey from 2007 and we won a      gold medal on our first try. Last year, our project AlkSensor won the gold medal      and Best Poster award. With the increasing times of successful or failed attempts in the competition.      We have accumulated much meaningful experience in the field of synthetic      biology. With all of the experiences and joint efforts, a more united, efficient and      passionate team is built up.
This year we form a team of 16 students from the school of chemical engineering.      Not only seeking help from our instructor, we are planning to launch a series of      interchange activities with other teams and Chinese Academy of Sciences. We      also pay attention to the potential impact of our project to our society. With our      joint efforts, we hope, by exploring the relationship between science and life, we      can make the world more wonderful.
OUR PROJECT
An efficient method to transduce biological sense into electric signal.
To detect the concentration of certain micromolecules quantitively in almost real time.
Questions it raises : 1.If we set up this platform above, what aspects can it apply to?
2,What methods can be applied to real-time     detection and analysis to some molecules     that are difficult to detect in traditional     ways?
3.How to maintain the stable structure of curli fiber when it functioned?
Biosensors are becoming more and more indispensable tools in     life science, medicine, chemistry and biotechnology, which are     greatly enhanced by synthetic biology.
Yet in the bio-sensing procedure, the limitations of signal output     methods restrict the usage and practicality of biosensors. Wildly     used reporters such as chromophore and fluorescent protein     which requires laboratorial equipments to measure often result in     the loss of accuracy and Immediacy. Thus our project is focus on the bio-signal transformation to     diversify output methods of biosensor. In account of the high     maturity of silicon analysis, it will be a great advantage to transduce     biological sense into electric signal. Following this idea, we design a transducer which can convert the     change of gene expression level that stimulated by inducer directly     into the electric signal via inductive synthesis（or destroy）of     nanowire between the electrodes. Curli fiber, a well characterized     amyloid fiber which forms β-sheet-rich amyloid fibers, seems     to be an ideal foundation of our nanowire structure. CsgA, the     modified morphon protein of curli fiber with the ability to bind     nano gold particles, will play the role as the conductor. Once we synthesize conductive curli fiber, there are two approach     to carry out the target sensing, by inductively synthesizing the     conductive fiber between the electrodes to turn on a switch for     connecting a open circuit, or inductively expressing the gene     coding the curli-degrading enzyme to destruct the pre-synthesized     nanowire. The change of the electric current shall represent the     concentration of inducer.

UI-Indonesia
OUR TEAM
We met for the first time in January 2014 and we’re all      undergraduate students from multidisciplinary backgrounds—      medicine, biology, bioengineering, and also chemical      engineering.
OUR PROJECT
Cholerae is major cause of death in children during first year     of life in tropical country. Cholera is tropical neglected disease     because it causes significant illness more than one billion people     and cholera outbreak rises when the disaster comes, because of     bad water sanitation.
In high cell density, Vibrio cholera formed biofilm to protect them     from milieu exterior disturbance therefore antibiotic and other     drugs treatment can not be effective against cholera infection. Here,     we proposed a novel strategy to degrade cholera biofilm by using     principles of synthetic biology. Our team genetically engineered     E. coli to specifically detect quorum sensing (QS) molecule from     Vibrio cholera. We use E.coli because it is normally found in human     intestine. Mutagenic E.coli able to detect specific quorum sensing     molecule by expressed receptor which is naturally expressed in     transmembrane domain of Vibrio cholera, this receptor called     CqsS receptor, a group of histidine kinases receptor. During     biofilm formation Vibrio cholera will secret quorum sensing     molecule called Vibrio cholera autoinducer 1 (CAI-1) which is bind     to CqsS receptor in E.coli. CAI-1 molecule act as “find me signal”     for E.coli, at the same time the binding of QS molecule to receptor     in E.coli, it will active motile gene, CheZ which is enable E.coli     migrate to source of infection, besides activate motile gene, it will     also activate killing gene which is enable E.coli producing biofilm     enzyme degrading matrix such as: alpha amylase, substilisin, and     nuclease. After release enzyme degrading matrix our E.coli will     secrete peptide 1018, an innate immunity peptide from human     cathelicidin which is successfully expressed in E.coli as novel     antibiotic peptide to kill Vibrio cholera directly. By interconnecting     the principles of pathogen-directed motility with the dual system     degrading and killing biofilm, we gained significantly develop     killing activity to combat biofilm formation and further severe     infection.

USTC_China iGEM team
OUR TEAM
Our team, founded in 2007, joined the iGEM competition as one      of the earliest teams in China and we got the 2nd runner up and      fundamental advance project that year.
Nowadays, we still spare no time trying to make our project come      true and propagate the biological knowledge to public.
OUR PROJECT
-Figure out the optimum conditions     of C.Crescentus development,     transformation and expression. -Develop the holdfast in C.Crescentus. -Extract the gene regulating the     expression of holdfast in C.Crescentus     and build parts with the regulating     system. -Construct the light sensing-response     system. -Guide the accomplished system into     E.coli and C.Crescentus. -Pre-test the function and efficiency of     ribozymes. -Plan the industrialization and further     development in biological imaging     industry. -Design the projector specialized for     biological imaging
Questions it raises :
Do you wanna try photographic film     produced by bacteria?
What do you care most when using this     product?
How do you like the development of other     fields’ technology into biological system?
Will you believe the future when everything     we use and require is produced by     organism?
This year, our team attempt to combine the photographic film     with biological system triggered by much careful investigation     of bacteria imaging study and light inducible response both in     recent research and iGEM team work.
We would like to call the system as Fast and Accurate Biological     Chromatic Sensing-Imaging System(FABCSIS) by respectively     joint red-green-blue (RGB) light sensing proteins with RGB     florescent proteins into a new pedestal Caulobacter Crescentus,     a kind of bacterium possessing adhesive holdfast which we can     utilize for more stable expression in distinct surroundings like     the water flow. And we are determinant to improve the system     with ribozymes regulation to enhance the accuracy and speed of     perception and response. At last, we will construct a customized     projector to measure the efficiency of system and make a plan for     the possibility of industrialization in the future. The FABCSIS, as we     wish, will realize the chromatic imaging system firstly held in the     media, regarding each individual as a pixel just like photographing.     We believe our work will drive the further study and development     of imaging system in other living organisms and one day biological     photographic films will appear in everybody’s daily life to change     the world for its lowcost and high resolution.
This year, we attempt to improve the technology in biological     system and hope our job could influence the development and     study of biological imaging chromatically. Besides, we seized     many opportunities to introducing genetic engineering and     synthetic biology to students who are intrigued in science, parents     and people who are worried about GMO without any biological     conception. We hope one day in China, everyone could make a     decision scientifically with knowledge and judgement with our tiny     efforts.
