Newsletter
This biweekly iGEM newsletter is cofounded by the Paris-Bettencourt team and the Xiamen University team in June. Through the three and half months, we had four regular issues, one special issue that includes interviews of past judge and iGEMer, and one student review session of the judging process.
There were more than 30 teams involved, from more than eight countries and regions. The regular issues have two major parts: project update and team member introduction.The teams wrote about one of the parts every two weeks, asked questions they want feedback on, and provided insights about other teams’ projects. We hope that through this activity, the teams are able to keep better record of their own projects, gain feedback from their peers and get to know other young synthetic biologists. It is a system of real-time peer review. We also try to provide the iGEM organization interesting feedbacks of how students regard the judging standard.
French Meet up
In the beggining of August most of the French teams gathered in Paris area (Saclay) to present their project ideas. We meet representants from different teams and exchanged our experience with iGEM. Paris Saclay prepared a video from this meeting. Paris Bettencourt team in exchange prepared short introductory videos of other teams: Paris _Saclay , Bordeaux , Evry , Lyon . We also took a chance to collect more sweat samples and get some odor evaluations. The meeting was accompanied with a debate around bioethics.
Collaboration with Rennes
These 5 students in Bioinformatics helped us a lot on developing the platform we needed to gather the citizen's smell analyzis.They allowed us to make the “Smell Game” and analyze the data from the smell analyzis.
UFR de chimie, Université Paris-Diderot
We analyzed volatile compounds with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer device in the chemistry laboratory of Paris-Diderot University. This led us to get qualitative and quantitative results to measure the efficiency of our constructs. In this way we thank warmly David CLAINQUART and Marie-Evelyne PINART.
Technion Israel 's wiki
The team received a mail from the iGEM team Technion Israel . They were asking for help about how to use the CSS styling on the wiki and the fonctionning of the template in the wiki format. The wiki coder of our team answered and successfully explained them the two previous concept.
The Faire of Science in Sevilla
We established a close collaboration thanks to some team member with the University Pablo de Olavidem in Seville (Spain). We collaborated in June in the Fair of Science of Sevilla, supporting one stand about biotechnology and iGEM organized by the students from the Association of Biotechnologists of Andalusia (AsBAn). The stand was visited by more than 200 high schoolers and we got contacts with Spanish teachers. After the development of the MOOC, we arranged the organization of a workshop on November 13th to test the MOOC with Spanish high school
'La Cité des Sciences'
La Cité des Sciences is dedicated in promoting scientific culture.This is the perfect place to get in touch with the general public.Thus began a residency in which we were explaining everything related to microbiome and body odors, followed by the collection of sweat samples and smell analyzis of what would be part of our citizen scientists.
La paillasse
La Paillasse is a nascent network of open laboratories across the world.It also provides support for open source development of disruptive technologies and helps beginners in creating and leading their project.Its co-creator is a former iGEM competitor who advised us and connected us to members interested in collaboration on body odors project.
Meetings with High school
We collaborated with the Lycée de la vallée de la chevreuse, a french highschool. We did there four sessions of two hours. During each session we presented the MOOC to the students. We introduced the student t synthetic biology and presented them our MOOC. During the session we asked the student to annotate and comment the MOOC. In total we had more than 60 students that annotated the MOOCand gave us feedbacks (500 interactions in the platform).
