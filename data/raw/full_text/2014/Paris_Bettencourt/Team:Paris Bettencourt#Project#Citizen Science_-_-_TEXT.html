Gym Class Heroes
Finally, we want to improve the knowledge of human microbial flora. We have decided to conduct an open citizen science project called “Gym Class Heroes.” The objective of this project is to create a massive and open database of the sequences in the microbiome of the human axilla. To do this, we will collect samples from volunteers, sequence their sweat microbiome and correlate it to their body odor. The long-term objective of this project is to identify wild type variants of odorous bacteria that have lost their bad odor due to a natural mutation and to use these natural variants to create probiotic cosmetics.
As a citizen science project, we will give people the opportunity to help us analyze our data and learn more about their own microbiome. We will also offer them the possibility to discover how others perceive their natural odor.
