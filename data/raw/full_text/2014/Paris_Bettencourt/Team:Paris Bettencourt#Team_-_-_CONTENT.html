While I was studying applied arts, I became deeply interested in Biology and harnessed my designer's energy to seek the potential of an exciting upcoming field witch is the synergy between design and biology.Whilst investigating this friction, I discovered Synthetic Biology. I became instantly amazed by its potential in real life implication and the role that design could have in this technology. Naturally, I then wanted to acquire actual wet lab experience in Synthetic Biology, enabling me to explore how designers can work with scientists and what are their roles, missions, interest would be. I believe iGEM is the best place for this investigation!</P></DIV></TD><TD><DIV class="portrait"><P id="dariel"><B>ARIEL LINDNER</B><I>Systems Biologist</I>I'm a researcher director at the Systems Evolutions and Engineering Dynamics (SEED) group at the French national Biomedical research Institute (INSERM) and co-founder of the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI).

I obtained my master's degree in Systems and Synthetic Biology at Paris Descartes University. In 2012 I was a student member of the iGEM Paris Bettencourt team and in 2013 I was an advisor. My primary scientific interest is application of synthetic biology for creating bioproducts as well as using synthetic biology in fundamental research. I am also quite interested in developing synthetic biology as a tool for creating living organisms from scratch as we build many non-living constructs today.</P></DIV></TD><TD><DIV class="portrait"><P id="djake"><B>JAKE WINTERMUTE</B><I>Systems Biologist</I>I’m a postdoc at the CRI and I teach the Synthetic Biology course for first-year master’s students.

I am very interested in system biology, biophysics, quantitative biology and single cell study approaches. Moreover I am also interested on how an interdisciplinary team can work together to resolve complex problems. I am very excited about iGEM, it’s a great opportunity to meet new people’s with a lot of talent and ideas. I am apparently a mutant for the Trimethylamine receptor, which is cool because apparently the lab is smelling a lot !</P></DIV></TD><TD><DIV class="portrait"><P id="djudith"><B>JUDITH BOLDT</B><I>Bioinformatician</I>I come from Hamburg, a city known for its rainy and windy weather. After studying Mathematics and Bioinformatics in the sunny Munich, I almost feel at home in Paris, where you never know if it will rain in the next minute. Before I joined iGEM, I spent 6 months studying at the CRI, getting to know a new and interactive way of learning. With iGEM, I want to put my theoretical knowledge into use in a scientific project.</P></DIV></TD><TD><DIV class="portrait"><P id="dihab"><B>IHAB BOULAS</B><I>Biologist</I> After graduating with a Biomedical Sciences BSc., my interests were focused on bringing new answers to neurodegeneration and aging by the use of innovative approaches such as Synthetic Biology. In that respect I wanted to learn by doing Synthetic Biology. Besides, I see this project as a large proof of concept : showing that we are able to control our microbiome. I am a project driven scientist. Being involved in a motivating project allows me to have full commitment to it and to live by it. Thus, I see this competition as an opportunity not only to commit to a project I helped design but also to broaden my skills and show what I can accomplish in a given period of time. It looks like it's gonna be a summer as great as smelly !</P></DIV></TD><TD><DIV class="portrait"><P id="dmarianne"><B>MARIANNE CARDON</B><I>Designer</I>I am a 24 years old student at ENSCI - Les Ateliers Design school. iGEM gives me the opportunity to work on a science base project with an international and interdisciplinary team. I think design can help to reach user centered project and question the relation between innovation and society, as much as facilitate the public access to scientific research and ideas. Taking part in this project is the best way to put theory into practice ! </P></DIV></TD><TD><DIV class="portrait"><P id="dula"><B>URSZULA CZERWINSKA</B><I>Systems Biologist</I>My name is Ula and I am from Poland.

Hey there.I study Biotechnologies for a year now and I love learning new stuff.This summer i've been mainly working on our citizen science project and gathered tons of sweat around Paris ! I also enjoy looking at people's face after smelling a sample, this is priceless ! After smelling billions of samples for iGEM (i never joke), I am now immune to strong and bad body odors, though i still cannot stand the odor from my neighbour cooking fish every single day, but that's a different story.Nevermind, BODY ODOR FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD, I CHALLENGE YOU, COME AT ME BRAS.</P></DIV></TD><TD><DIV class="portrait"><P id="djuanmag"><B>JUAN MANUEL GARCIA</B><I>Biotechnologist</I>Hiya!

Upon my arrival to Paris, I took the metro from the airport to my new apartment, and immediately realized the reason behind the energy and enthusiasm the team had to cure body odor. My hope is that the Paris metro will one day smell of jasmine and wintergreen. I dream of the day when people on my team will stop asking me to smell samples of armpit odor, fish odor, foot odor, and a milieu of other extremely disgusting odors.</P></DIV></TD><TD><DIV class="portrait"><P id="dmegane"><B>MEGANE MATYSIAK</B><I>Bio-engineer</I>I am a student in biotechnology engineering. My interests involve fields such as optogenetics, bioelectric controlled prosthesis, and biotechnologies in general. Since biotechnologies involve more and more synthetic biology, iGEM seemed like the perfect opportunity for me to learn by doing. Moreover, I wanted to apply my skills in bioinformatics and engineering to a common issue: the human-microbiome relationship.
Therefore it is reasonable to think that my expectations for this summer will be smelly fulfilled! </P></DIV></TD><TD><DIV class="portrait"><P id="destefania"><B>ESTEFANIA MUCINO CASTILLO</B><I>Biologist</I>My name is Estefanía.
