COLLABORATION
This is the list of all our collaborations with iGEM teams, organizations, and experts.
NEWSLETTER
In June, we started our biweekly newsletter with the Xiamen University iGEM team. Through the four months period, more than 30 teams from all over the world joined us and enhanced the community. Here you can find all the issues.
THE SMELL GAME
A great example of collaboration between the teams. Together with the iGEM team from Rennes we developed a game that helps us generate, characterize, analyze and store the smell data.
“None of us is as smart as all of us”. We believe science should be open, freely discussed and shared between people. Collaborations are fun and they make science better (and better science).
