From 2014.igem.org
MON 19 MAY 2014
Cleaned up lab. Read lots of literature.
TUE 20 MAY 2014
Looking for alpha-factor responsive promoters. Results can be found in "iGEM 2014/Parts and Plasmids/Mating Responsive Promoters/"
WED 21 MAY 2014
Continuing search for more alpha-factor responsive promoters to add to the 16 that we have found so far.
Also, designing primers for the promoters that we have found so far. For primer design, see "iGEM 2014/Protocols/cloning_DH5aT.docx"
MON 02 JUN 2014
I. Calculated Ligation concentrations found in 140602 Ligation Calculation.xlsx and performed ligation reactions.
II. Also re-PCR'd promoters that did not work before.  Please see paper notebook page 3 for gel map. Gel image:
TUE 03 JUN 2014
I. Re-PCR'd promoters that we did not do yesterday. See gel photos:
Also gel extracted.
II. Selected colonies and inoculated cultures.
WED 04 JUN 2014
I. Digest PCR reactions and PCR cleanup. Completed.  Concentration of Promoter 6 is pretty bad compared to others.
II. Inoculated single colony plates.
THURS 05 JUN 2014
I. Eric and Derrick are retrying digestion of backbone for the third time after two failed attempts.  Will try ligation and transformation into e. coli today.
II. Need to miniprep plates with single colonies.
III. Linearize DNA for Yeast Transformation Linearized PRM1, SAG1, YDR124W. See concentrations here:
FRI 06 JUN 2014
I. Designed Gibson Primers and produced Promoter + rtTA ApE files.
II. Performed gel extraction of re-digested backbone.  See gel photo below:
.
See how the band is at the right place now at around 8kb, but that there isn't really a smaller band. Possible that the smaller band ran off the gel.
Overall:  Found that most of the promoters worked out in the end with cloning. Ready for yeast transformation and integration into yeast genome. Now trying to figure out next steps.
MON 09 JUN 2014
I. iGEM Bootcamp started.
II. Minipreps of Transformations from attempt 2.  Vacuum manifold does not clear PE Buffer as well as centrifuges. May have ended with more than 50microliters of product. Nanodrop showed that our concentrations are okay still. We are now sending out these samples for sequencing.
TUE 10 JUN 2014
I. iGEM Bootcamp.
II. Dual Digest of miniprepped backbones to remove GFP from built vectors → will digest overnight.
III. Worked on iGEM website.
IV. Sequencing came back and found that all miniprepped vectors turned out well → moving forward with yeast transformation and Dual digest for rtTA incorporation as seen in II.

THUR 19 JUN 2014
I. Dilute inoculated cultures. (2 hours)
Flow Cytometer Preparation
Day Before: start overnight cultures of your strains to be tested in SD complete media (NOT YPD, since it has fluorescence background and is problematic for FACS testing)
Day Of: 1. Dilute overnight cultures to final ~OD 0.05-0.1 in the 96 well shaker plate (the saturated overnight cultures should be ~OD 7, so this is approximately a 1:100 dilution. Also, where are the plates? If you don't know, ask and make a note.). Again, use SD complete media and the total volume of each well should be 1 mL. Make a plate map!
Allow cells to enter growth stage by putting on plate shaker for 3 hours at 1000 rpm, 30 degrees C.
Induce with alpha factor. The stock alpha factor in the freezer is 3 mM, and we used it at final concentrations of 0, 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, and 1 uM. **Please include your concentrations for making the dilutions we used to pipette so that you can quickly and easily refer to this for next time!** Alpha factor cannot be refrozen, so throw away stocks after use.
Allow induction to proceed on plate shaker for 90 min to 2 hours, no longer.
Transfer 250 uL of each culture to the 96 well flow cytometry V-bottom plate using the multichannel pipette. Add 4µl of cyclohexamide for every 100µl of cells (10µl total) to kill cells and stop protein production.
Run on flow cytometer. Things you should note:
Check waste, turn machine on, check sheathing fluid.
Open FACS diva. Use iGEM account.
Make new plate or new experiment.
Make sure settings for each well is accurate. Ensure that pick up volume is not more than volume in each well, that the mixing volume is not more than volume in each well.
Make sure laser settings, voltage settings are correct. (View>inspector)
FSC: 250 SSD: 280 FITC: 550 B: 650
Click blue button to tag selected wells as wells with samples to test.
Flow rate: 1µL/sec Sample Volume: 200µL Mixing Volume: 100µL Mixing speed: 180µL/sec
Always run wells, not run plate.
FIRST what things you need to check on the machine before running!, how to open the iGEM account and create a new FACS experiment, voltage settings (and tips on how to set an appropriate voltage setting), how to select wells and alter the volume of sample, flow speed, mixing volume, etc, how to run the plate/wells, how to export data, and anything else you might need)
Analyze data. Notes on that from what you learned in FlowJo and MatLab today.
II. Expose to alpha factor (~90 minutes) (0, 10nM, 1µM, 10µM, 100µM)
Correction 24 JUNE 2014: (0, 1nM, 10nM, 100nM, 1µM)
Flow Cytometer 1-4pm.
How to use flow cytometer:  1. Check the sheathing fluid levels! 2. Press run  3. On computer, use flowjo.  4. Check voltages! (in notebook) 5. Select wells 6. run! 7. Make sure you see a good number of events.

I will be working with YDR124W and PRM6.
III. Prepare glycerol stocks of DB promoter + GFP yeast strains.  IV. Pick and inoculate cultures with promoter + rtTA again since most of the sequencing failed. Will need to re-linearize most of the yeast.
FRI 20 JUN 2014
I. Leaving early today for Doctor's appointment.  II. Minipreps for rtTA+promoter.
MON 23 JUN 2014
I. Found that the rtTA that we cloned were incorrect. Did not including activating domain.  II. Inoculating HYM1 DH5alpha + GFP again for more plasmid.
Now working on Flow Cytometry data analysis of alpha responsive promoters.  Now working on pTET/GFP/mFalpha. p2A?
TUE 24 JUN 2014
I. Literature search on feasibility of P2A incorportation of alpha factor and other sequences.  II. FlowJo notes:
Import data. Save in save folder on desktop.  Double click to open a sample.  Gate the sample population.  Activate gate: gives a percentage of samples in gate.   Click on sample list and click on gate name for analysis on just gated region.   Save workspaces so that you can continue analysis later on.  Displaying mean: click on statistics and click ∑ for which stats that you want.   Look through individual samples for obscurities.   Matlab: comment with what workspace your data comes from.   Enter in data by hand.

Yeast Transformation Protocol
T-(1 day) Grow yeast strains in 5-10ml YPD overnight at 30°C
T-(2–4hours) Dilute cultures ~1:20 in YPD.  Grow for 2-4 hours @ 30°C to OD_600 = 0.4-0.6. Make sure to inoculate 2.5ml per transformation reaction.
T-(20 minutes) Boil salmon sperm DNA for 10 minutes and cool on ice for 10 minutes. (This can be done in the thermocycler with the ssDNA Heat-Freeze protocol) Thaw DMSO! Pellet cells (3000rpm 2-5min). Discard supernatant.  Wash with 1:1 culture volume of LOATE(0.1M LiOAc in TE) or water.  Pellet cells (3000rpm 2-5min). Discard supernatant.  Resuspend pellet in 100µl per reaction (aka per 2.5mL of culture volume)  Aliquot 100µl into each transformation reaction tube.  To each tube of 100µL yeast, add:
10µL of ssDNA
8µL of target DNA(Hyun's standard amount after linearization)
480µL of 50% PEG 3350
60µL TE(10XTE)

Sick today :/ Tummy hurts
See below for repeat of AFRP GFP measurements in biological replicates.
Some questions that we still need to answer:
Why yeast instead of bacteria? Other studies have made similar circuits in bacteria before (see "Building Biological Memory by Linking Positive Feedback Loops" by Dong-Eun Chang et al.) The argument that yeast are slightly more representative of eukaryotic cells here seems far-fetched as we are not really looking at anything endogenous to yeast. Not that I think we should drop everything and start working in bacteria. We should have a solid response to this though.

[ ] Understanding background
[ ] Focus on how T-reg cells interact with macrophages. Macrophages can play a suppressive role on T-regs.
[ ] Dendritic cells and T-reg cells as an example of a divergent system.
[ ] Stanford iGEM 2010: interaction between t-reg and t-helper cells.
[ ] How microglia interact with different cell types: might play a role in regulating T-helper cells.
[ ]  Non-immune standpoint
[ ] Examples of how cells respond and coordinate using secondary post-cellular signaling.
[ ] OVERALL GOAL: Understand how your work can help elucidate and understand other cell/organism interactions through community signaling

[ ] Model for pTEFrtTA pTETGFP pTETmFα ARFPmFα circuit
[ ] Functions
[ ] Develop function to model pTEFrtTA -> pTETGFP/pTET_mFα.
[ ] Need to understand how [Doxycycline] alters [α]. Does [GFP] correlate directly with [α]?
[X] Develop function to model AFRP_RFP
[ ] Develop function for Diffusion of Alpha factor as as F(Initial Alpha Factor Concentration, Time, Distance)
[X] Data for Model
[X] Export all sigmoid fits
Conclusions from today:  To understand Alpha Factor Secretion, need to understand how [Doxy] -> pTEF1rtTA -> pTETGFP results translate to [Doxy] -> pTEF1rtTA -> pTETmFα -> [α].  Need this circuit: ([Doxy] -> pTEF1rtTA -> pTETmFα -> [α]) + (pAGA1RFP -> [RFP]) and then use ([α] -> pAGA1GFP -> [GFP]) measurements to understand the local concentrations of Alpha Factor from each cell.
Need to construct: ([Doxy] -> pTEF1rtTA -> pTETGFP + pTETMFα -> pAGA1RFP -> [RFP])
Questions for Hyun:
How does one find the phenomological alpha factor secretion from the data that we currently have: [Doxy] -> (pTEF1rtTA + pTETGFP) -> [GFP] and [α] -> (AFRP_GFP) -> [GFP].
Even though there seems to be a one-to-one correlation between [GFP] and [α], leading us to an understanding of local [α], what does that say about [rtTA-Dox] -> pTET_GFP production of GFP, and eventually [α]?

Colony PCR of pPCL2BFP and pAGA1BFP
Miniprep'd pAGA1 in lanes 5 and 6.
Picked new colonies from pPCL2 plate and ran colony PCR.
WED 06 AUG 2014
Working on Poster for Santa Cruz today.  Found mixed peaks in sequencing reaction. Otherwise, sequences were correct. Will transform minipreps and re-miniprep. Miniprep pPCL2 today.
THURS 07 AUG 2014
Sequences from pPCL2 BFP worked out very well. Colonies grew on pAGA1BFP  plate and not on negative control. Will miniprep pAGA1BFP tomorrow.

Rest of the AFRPrtTA pTETGFP
Set in induction at 8:11AM.
Notes about pTEF1rtTA pTETGFP pTETMFa pAGA1RFP data from Friday:
GFP Noise:  Very consistent pattern across almost all strains(mutations of pTEF1). High  [Doxycycline] induces noise to decrease over time, while lower doxycycline concentrations maintain similar noise levels over time, and some even increase.

Back at it!  Taught people how to generate graphs from flow data. Also taught people how to generate scatter plots from flow data. Produced graphs for flow data from many days ago.
Decided to not continue with pECM18 and pPRM6 as they did not seem to express more than basal level.
THURS 21 AUG 2014
Attempted to use R for further data analysis. Importing data into R may be too complicated and time-consuming.
FRI 22 AUG 2014
Seems like all DB strains have RFP expression without induction with Doxy. Most likely due to leakiness in Tet-On circuit.
Decided to not analyze data from Tuesday and will be running experiments again on Monday.
Downloaded and install flowjo on my computer for easier remote work.
