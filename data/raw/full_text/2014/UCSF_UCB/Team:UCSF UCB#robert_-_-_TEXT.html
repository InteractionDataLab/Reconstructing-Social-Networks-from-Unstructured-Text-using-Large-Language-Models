95           5min 30X: 95      45s      55      30s      72      1min per kb 72           10min
3) Anaylze products on a gel.  GoTaq has loading gel in it already.  Load 5ul of PCR reaction.
4) For all positive bands, take the rest o the bacterial cells from step 1 and grow them in LB overnight (+antibiotic) for miniprep next day.

Flow Cytometry
Night Before:
1) Start overnight cultures using SD complete media
Day of:
1) Dilute cultures to final ~OD (Optimal Density) in the 96 well shaker plate (overnight cultures should be around ~OD7, so about a 1:100 dilution). Use SD media to make each well a total volume of 1mL

2) Allow cells to grow on plate shaker for 3 hours at 1000 rpm
3) Induce with Alpha Factor.  The Alpha Factor in the freezer is at 3mM and we're using concentrations at 0.1nm, 1nm, 10nm, 100nm, and 1uM
-Concentrations
3mM --> 30ul + 870ul water
⍒
100uM --> 50ul + 450ul water
⍒
10um --> 50ul + 450ul water
⍒
1000nm 50ul + 450ul water
⍒
100nm
*Alpha Factor cannot be refrozen so dump after use
4) Allow induction to proceed on plate shacker for 1.5 - 2 hours
5) Transfer 250 ul of each culture into a 96 V-Well
6) RUn on flow cytometer
-Checklist ✓:
Check status of machine (should be on standyby) Check fluid boxes and stroage tanks Do not run plate. Run well. Have a positive & negative control Open iGEM account (pw: biobricks) Make new FACS experiment
-Voltage:
CHeck inspector to see if everything is on  FCS: 250 SSC: 280 FITC: 550  Sample Flow Rate: 1 Sample Volume: 200 Mixing Volume: 100 Mixing Speed: 180 Number of Mixes: 3 Wash Volume: 400
-Wells
Select wells to run (make sure volume is 50ul below actual amount) and there will be a side bar of options on how to adjust your gels (mixing, flow speed) Run well & save data onto USB *Don't turn on wifi
7) Analyze Data
