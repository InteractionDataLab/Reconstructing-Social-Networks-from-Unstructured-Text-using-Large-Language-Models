       - CLG1+rtTA pTET+mfalpha successful; all others failed
II. Linearization of plasmids
       - use PmeI
III. Start cultures for retransformation (8/13 II.)
Wednesday August 13, 2014
Poster arrived!
I. Yeast Colony PCR
       - check CB008 pTET+GFP HYM1+rtTA pTET+mfalpha
       - colony 10 worked; culture made for glycerol stocks and transformation
II. Yeast Tranformation
       - a. add pPCL2+RFP, pAGA+RFP, pPCL2+BFP to CB008 pTET+GFP AFRP+rtTA pTET+mfalpha
       - b. add AFRP+rtTA to CB008 pTET+GFP: PRM6, ECM18, SAG1, PCL2
       - suspend CB008DB pTET+GFP AFRP+rtTA transformations
       - Results (Checked 8/18): b. all failed. BFP suspended due to lack of supplies. a. first Colony PCR failed, HYM1 failed, rest successful
III. Glycerol Stocks of CB008 pTET+GFP AFRP+rtTA pTET+mfalpha        - PRM1, PRM2, PRM3, YDR124W, CLG1, ASG7
