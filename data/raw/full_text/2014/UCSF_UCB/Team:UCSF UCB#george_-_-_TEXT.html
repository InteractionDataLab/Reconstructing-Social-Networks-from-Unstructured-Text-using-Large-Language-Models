Colony PCR for Screening E. coli
1. Pick a single colony using a sterile wooden stick and mix in 25ul of water in a PCR tube. Do this for about 4-6 colonies. Use 5ul for the PCR reaction below, adn save the rest for later.  2. Set up PCR reaction as below:                                             1x Reaction      6x master mix                                         ---------------------------------- 2X Go Taq Green PCR Master Mix                  10ul               60ul 10 uM FW primer                                  1ul                6ul 10uM RV primer                                   1ul                6ul Water                                            3ul               18ul  Bacterial cells (template)                       5ul                --         Cycles:             95                      5 min             30X:    95              45 s                     55              30 s                     72              1 min per kb (adjust accordingly)             72                      10 min  3. Analyze products on a 1% agarose gel. The GoTaq mix alread has gel loading dye in it, so you can just directly load 5ul of your PCR readction into a gel.  4. For all positive bands on the gel, take the rest of the bacterial cells from step 1 and inoculate them into and overnight LB (+antibiotic) for miniprep the next day.
E. coli Colony PCR results

Colony Dilutions
20x dilutions to all CB008 and CB008DB alpha-promoter yeast.  *Note: CB008DB PRM1-2 sticker was labled on top of CB008 SAG1-3 and could've resulted in a sticker coming off at night.
Glycerol stocks
1:20 Dillution 200ul cells + 9.8ml YPD media. FREEZE

Flow Cytometry
1. Start overnight cultures of our strains to be tested om SD complete media instead of YPD (YPD has fluorescence). 2. Dilute overnight cultures to OD 0.05-0.1 in the 96-well shakeplate.  The plates are in a cabinet in the limlab wrapped in shiny paper. USe SD complete media and the total volume of the well should be 1mL. Make a plate map now. 3. Allow cells to enter growth phase by putting wells in plate shakers for 3 hours at 1000rpm@30 degrees. 4. Allow induction with alpha factor. The stock alpha factor is 3mM and we used 0, 1, 10, 100, 1000nM. (Stocks cannot be refrozen, discard after use) 5. Allow cells to enter growth stage by putting on plate for 90-120 minutes, no more.96  6. Transfer 20ul of each culture to the 96 well flow-cytometry v-bottom plate. Use cycloheximide to arrest cells. Cycloheximide suspends cell division. 7. Run on Flow Cytometer     1. Check liquid box for sufficient amount of liquid, if too low, scream for help.     2. Check the second tub for liquid with clear top. It should also have some liquid, don;t shake too harshly     3. Check the gasoline tank, if kinda full dump out and add some bleach to the bottom of the container.     4. You can open the iGEM 2014 path and the default settings will be default, but check it anyway to be sure.     5. For each new experiment, load 2 neg control wells and run those first as a blank.
(Voltage settings: FSC:250, SSC:280, FTC:550
Select wells by double-clicking until it is green and you can just add more. The volume can be modified, but 200ul is suggested (decrease by 50ul from our load)
Flow speed is usually kept at either 0.5ul per second or 1ul/second and can be adjusted relatively quickly. VOlume can be less than our sample volume.
Data is exported by usb, no internet is allowed.)
8. Analyze data (graphs: histogram vs FTC,FSC vs SSC) Flowjo note on page 17 and export to matlab yo.
