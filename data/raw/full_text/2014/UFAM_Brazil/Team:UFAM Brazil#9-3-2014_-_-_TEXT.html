Growth of bacteria with our bio bricks in medium LM (LB + mercury chloride) it’s in progress!!! We could see that bacteria after exposure to Hg gets a grey coloration and with abnormal growth pattern.
The test in medium LM 50ug/ml and 100ug/ml with wild bacteria from the contaminated stream and Negro River is ready. As observed on the following table:
Only two samples (A3 and A4) didn’t grow in medium LM 50ug/ml. Maybe the reason is because Negro River, where bacteria was collected (Açutuba beach), doesn’t have high mercury contamination. We continued the process to identify those super bacteria and today we plated the samples A1, A2; E1, E2; P1, P2, P3; S1 in solid LB.
