Today we continued with total DNA extraction from wild bacteria that show resistance to high Hg concentrations using the phenol-chloroform method, started on September 6th. And guess what? We still couldn’t finish today, again! We let DNA in R buffer (Tris-HCl + EDTA) so tomorrow it will be super pretty on gel! ♥
We also continued with our new constructions and transfared DH5α with bio bricks K611025 (promoter 1), J23100 (promoter 3) e K516030 (mRFP generator) in liquid medium LB with its selection markers. (For more information, please, access September 1st and 7th )
Today we also had progress with the tests for bio bricks sequencing, started on September 2nd. We measured concentration of each part in PSB1C3 on spectrophotometer, the result was:
BB_Essential sample 10: 50ng/ul.
BB_Bioremediation sample 7: 80ng/ul
BB_Essential + E0840 sample 1: 70ng/ul.
BB_Essential + E0840 sample 2: 140ng/ul.
BB_Essential + K346004 sample 4: 160ng/ul
BB_Essential + K346004 sample 6: 240ng/ul.
BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation sample 8: 140ng/ul.
BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation sample 9: 150ng/ul.
We also analyzed the electrophoretic profile of each sample in agarose gel 0.8%.
Electrophoretic profile of bio bricks in PSB1C3:
1 – 3: BB_Essential + E0840 in PSB1C3
4 – 6: BB_Essential + K346004 in PSB1C3
7: BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3
8 – 9: BB_Essential + K346004 in PSB1C3
10: BB_Essential in PSB1C3
We’re going to need 200ng/ul to 500ng/ul for sequencing. Tomorrow we’re doing the sequencing reaction! We’re going to need 200ng/ul to 500ng/ul for sequencing. Tomorrow we’re doing the sequencing reaction! =)
