About Us
Manaus is the capital of  Amazonas State,  located in the middle of Brazilian Amazon rainforest. It is the largest city in the Amazon with more than 2 million inhabitants and a vibrant culture with a gorgeous gastronomy and lots of places to visit. That's the scenario we have surrounding us: Amazon river, rainforest, macaws flying over us and we loving it of course! But we were missing something...why not a little bit of Synthetic Biology in a place full of biodiversity? Yes, we went for it!

UFAM stands for Federal University of Amazonas, is the largest University and the best ranked in the region. We are from many science fields such as biology, biotechnology, medicine, art and design, computer science, chemistry and engineering.

We are here to show just a small part of our rich Science in Manaus, home of our team, and we hope you’ll enjoy as much as we did throughout the process.
The UFAM_Brazil team was created back in 2012 under the name Manaus-Amazonas-Brazil when we participated on the Latin America Jamboree. This year, our team is composed by fifteen students, from high school to undergrads. Our main objective is to use synthetic biology in order to innovate technologies being applied in the Amazon region, with the ultimate goal of preserving what matters the most for the future generations: it's biodiversity!
