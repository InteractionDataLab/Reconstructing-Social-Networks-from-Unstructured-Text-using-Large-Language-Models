The inoculum in liquid medium grew and we extracted plasmidial DNA from JM110 and C2925 with pUC72.
We got the DNA diluted from the 2013 DNA kit (Parts Kit). Of the following biobricks, to perform the transformation: BBa_E0840 and BBa_K346004.
We transformed JM110 by electroporation – and washed it with sorbitol 1M – and commercial DH10B with the following biobricks: BBa_E0840 and BBa_K346004.
