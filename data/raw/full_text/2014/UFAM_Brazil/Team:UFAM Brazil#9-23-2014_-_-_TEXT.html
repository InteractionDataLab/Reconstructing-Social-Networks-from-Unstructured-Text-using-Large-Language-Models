Today we made quantifications using spectrophotometer of all biobricks that will be submitted for the competition (BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential, BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential + BB_E0840 and BB_Essential + BB_K346004).
Meanwhile we also prepared mercury solutions to be used tomorrow to do the calibration curve for mercury quantification of our experiment with the bioaccumulation construction (BB_Essential + K346004).
It will be made two calibration curves to obtain a pattern. The first on using LM liquid medium as matrix, and the second using buffer TN (Tris HCl 10mM and NaCl 0,15M). The pattern dots will be concentrations of 0.001 µg/ml, 0.005 µg/ml, 0.01 µg/ml, 0.05 µg/ml, 0.1 µg/ml and 0.5 µg/ml
