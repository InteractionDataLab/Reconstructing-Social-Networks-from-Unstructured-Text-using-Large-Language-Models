Heeello, what’s up?!?!
Today we made final adjustments for the bioremediation cell growth in medium LM with the following mercury concentrations of 20µg/ml, 10µg/ml, 5µg/ml, 2.5µg/ml, 1 µg/ml and 0µg/ml. We will use cells with the bio detection construction (that does not have resistance gene to Hg, MerA) as control!  Today we also sent our bio bricks to iGEM, phew!!
