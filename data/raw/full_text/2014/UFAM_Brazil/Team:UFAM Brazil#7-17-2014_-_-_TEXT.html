Today we minipreped DH5α with BBa_E0840 (Biodetection Biobrick) and DH5α with BBa_K346004 (Bioaccumulation Biobrick).
Eletrophoretical profile from the samples:
We concentrated the extracted biobricks to transform in JM110.
After the plasmid concentration, the JM110 got chemically competent with a rapid method with Sorbitol 1M and the electroporation with:
- Negative control, no DNA.
- Positive control with pUC72;
- BBa_E0840 (Biodetection Biobrick);
- BBa_K346004 (Bioaccumulation Biobrick).
