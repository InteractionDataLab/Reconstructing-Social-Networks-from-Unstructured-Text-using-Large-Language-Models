Today we had an awesome day!!!! We made digestion using XbaI and EcoRI on biobricks E0840 K346004 unmethylated from the Parts Kit 2014 with the following system:
The digestion lasted 2 hours at 37°C.  The amount of gel used for each sample was 10ul and 40 ul was kept in the fridge at -20°C  to be used for purification later.
Eletrophoretical profile of the digestions:
1. E0840 not digested
2. E0840 digested with XbaI and EcoRI
3. K346004 not digested
4. K346004 digested with XbaI and EcoRI
After we saw that the digestion worked, we ran the rest of the microliters from the digestion (40ul) in another gel just to get the Dna purified through the new  gel.
A picture of the cut gel from the electrophoresis used for purification:
We had lots of fun working on the purification with the help of prof. Spartaco!!!! =)
Afterwards, we ran the gel with the purified fragments to analyze the results:
1. E0840 linearized – digested with EcoRI and XbaI
2. K346004 linearized –  digested EcoRI and XbaI
Biobricks linearized!!!HURRAY!!! \0/
Today, we had great news: our laboratory is now ready for Mercury manipulation!!!!! A huge step for our institution, because it’s not just  the first laboratory for Synthetic Biology in Brazil, it’s also the first lab that allows manipulation of Mercury for the production of culture medium at the Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM)!
Such a bliss!!!!
