Today is day for colony’s PCR!!! Today we made colony’s PCR of DH5α transformed with our bio bricks (BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential + K346004 and BB_Essential + E0840),using the following system:
Electrophoretic profile of colony’s PCR:
From this profile of colony’s profile we concluded that our desired fragments were amplified and that we’re really close to conclude our genetic constructions! We selected the transformed colonies. Selecionamos as colônias transformadas:
Inoculum was made from the selected colonies in 3 ml liquid medium with antibiotic.
