ONLY 8 DAYS TO DEADLINE WIKI FREEZE!
Today we finished the cell growth test of bacteria for bioremediation in medium containing Hg, made on October 7th and 8th. We also kept working on several texts for Registry, and finishing the banner, besides getting crazy with wiki’s deadline! Soo many texts!!
