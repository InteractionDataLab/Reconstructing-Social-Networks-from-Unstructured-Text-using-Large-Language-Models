Hi, there! Today is Sunday, and of course we didn’t stop working! The transformation of the BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential + K346004 and BB_Essential + E0840 in DH5α developed! Today we selected 16 colonies from BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation, 16 colonies from BB_Essential + E0840 and 10 colonies from BB_Essential + K346004 to transfer and tomorrow we will make colony’s PCR. An inoculum in liquid medium of 2 colonies from BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation, was made, as well as 9 colonies from BB_Essential + K346004 and 2 colonies of BB_Essential + E0840. This was what we could recover from las transformation, in which the binding system wasn’t concentrated.
In total we have: 18 colonies from BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation;
19 colonies from BB_Essential + K346004; and 16 colonies of BB_Essential + E0840.
Sooooo many plates!!!!!
