ONLY 10 DAYS TO DEADLINE WIKI FREEZE!
Hello! Today was a decisive day! We started the bioremediation cell growth test (DH5a with BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3) in LM medium with the following Hg concentrations of 20µg/ml, 10µg/ml, 5µg/ml, 2.5µg/ml, 1 µg/ml and 0µg/ml. We used the spectrophotometer at absorbance of 600nm, and as we explained previously, we will use the construction for bio detection as control. Because this doesn’t contain resistance gene to Hg, MerA. This test objective is to evidence the difference regarding to cell growth of Escherichia coli non-modified for bioremediation in comparison to the ones modified for bioremediation having the bio brick (BBa_K1355000)! Let’s go! We made inoculum of control cells and Mercury Bacter for bioremediation in falcon tubes of 50ml with 10ml of medium LM on the Hg concentrations mentioned above. Today we measured the samples from periods of time of 2:30, 4:30, and 6:30 hours after the start of the experiment. Tomorrow we will measure after 17 and 24 hours of cell growth!
