Today we made plasmid DNA’s extraction from colonies that amplified the bio bricks inserts BB_Essential and BB_Bioremediation separately PSB1C3.
Electrophoretic Extraction’s profile:
1: BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 extracted from colony 2.
2: BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 extracted from colony 3.
3: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 extracted from colony 2.
4: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 extracted from colony 4.
5 – 6: Extração of “BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3” that didn’t amplify, just made out of curiosity
As we showed last day, the BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation insert in PSB1C3 didn’t amplify on colonies’ PCR on transformed DH5a.
Due to that, we’re going to redo the PCR with all colonies we got from the DH5a transformation with the BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 binding system.
In total we have 20 colonies. We used the primers VR and VF2.
Electrophoretic colony PCR’s profile:
All samples from 1- 19 are BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3.
We selected the just the samples 8 and 11 for plasmid DNA extraction and made inoculum in liquid LB medium with chloramphenicol 34ug/ml.
