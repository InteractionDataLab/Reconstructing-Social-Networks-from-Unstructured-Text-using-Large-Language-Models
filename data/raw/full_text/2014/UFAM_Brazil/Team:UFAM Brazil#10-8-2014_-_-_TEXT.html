ONLY 9 DAYS TO DEADLINE WIKI FREEZE!
Today we continued the cell growth test of the bioremediation bacteria (DH5a with BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3) in LM medium with Hg concentrations of 20ug/ml, 10ug/ml, 5ug/ml, 2.5ug/ml, 1 ug/ml and 0ug/ml. We also measured after 17 and 24 hours of experiment. And today we also started to produce the team introduction’s banner that’s due on October 10th!
