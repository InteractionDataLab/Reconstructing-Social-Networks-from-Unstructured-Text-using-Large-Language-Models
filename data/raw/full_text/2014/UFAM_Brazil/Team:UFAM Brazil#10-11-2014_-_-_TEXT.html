ONLY 6 DAYS TO DEADLINE WIKI FREEZE!
Hello! Our lab journey is getting to its end. We will use the bioremediation Mercury Bacter (BBa_K1355004) cell growth test in medium with Hg to measure quantity of bioremediated Hg after 3 days of cell growth at concentrations of 20ug/ml, 10ug/ml, 5ug/ml, 2.5ug/ml, 1 ug/ml and 0ug/ml. We will use the equipment DMA- 80 (Direct Mercury Analyzer), to quantify Hg accumulation by Mercury Bacter for bioaccumulation. We’re developing strategies for this last test! Without saying about the craziness of wiki’s deadline being so close! So many papers to write. Now panic and freak out!
