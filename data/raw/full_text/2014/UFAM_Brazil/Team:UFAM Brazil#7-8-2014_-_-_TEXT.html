Unfortunately, we couldn’t transform the diluted DNA from the 2013 DNA kit.
Today, instead of trying to transform using JM110 by washing it with sorbitol 1M or using a commercial cell, we used Escherichia coli DH5α chemically competent cell to transform biobrick BBa_E0840.
We also transformed Escherichia coli DH5α with  pUC72 having approximately  1.000ng/ul and 1ng/ul, because we wanted to find out if the reason why the diluted DNA didn’t work was due to its low concentration.
