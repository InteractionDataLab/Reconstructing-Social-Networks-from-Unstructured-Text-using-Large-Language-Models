Team Collaboration
Mexico
We as a team, believe that exchanging knowledge and experiences with other iGEM teams is extremely important to fully understand the spirit of the competition, aiming to achieve the goals and value Synthetic Biology by producing knowledge.
Over the project course, an area we found really challenging was the Math Modeling, given that our team didn’t have the full expertise in this field. However we were able to overcome these difficulties with help of our Mexican brothers team from Monterrey University, making the whole difference in our modeling approaches.
Through the data found in the experiment, the team helped us to formulate equations that resemble the behavior seen on the biosensoring, bioaccumulation and bioremediation. These equations and models provide means for checking and evaluate our experiments before hands on. Ahead the bench modeling is proved to be a nice a start for lab preparations. The usefulness of this subject made us aware the need of interlocution with Math and Statistic departments from our own University for the next iGEM year to come.
Thank you Mexico, thank you Tecnológico de Monterrey-campus Querétaro, thank you BIOSINT_Mexico ! Building a modeling together gave us major benefit to our work in SynBio. Looking forward to meet all you guys personally at the GJ (Giant Jamboree), see you all there!
Sao Paulo
This year we had the most expressive Brazil’s participation in iGEM. Four teams representing three distinct Brazilian regions.  Two teams from southeast, one from northeast and our from north (Amazon). We all had a perception we couldn’t miss the opportunity here! People from Brazil-SP team repeated this year what was a pilot last year, the "Jamboré", a "brazificated" Jamboree. We got together and we were in iGEM’s Jamboree mood hight there in São Paulo. For us was more than 2 thousand miles to go there, but we did it and enjoyed it!
The whole buzz took place in August 1st 2014, Brazilian teams participating in IGEM competition decided to hold a meeting to introduce their projects, discuss new ideas and strategies, assist in the development of projects and clarify general doubts regarding competition.
The meeting was so constructive! All projects were very interesting, it was very nice to see that all teams have the same day-by-day difficulties in lab, and in other to overcome these barriers, we exchanged tips and protocols. Another really cool part was hearing from different teams brilliant opinions on each project and see that each team had a little to add on other projects, making the small failures easier to be resolved. Anyway the meeting was super relaxing and constructive just like IGEM way of being! And to finish with a flourish, we played many games, accompanied by beer and fries. :)
