Hii!! Today was a big day for us! We decided our method for mercury quantification. It is available in method’s section! Now, instead of keep working on the new constructions, the entire team will work on the identification! We’re also dedicating our time on production and methods to quantify Hg that was remediated and accumulated! REALLY IMPORTANTS steps!
Tomorrow we’re going to use the spectrofluorometer for the first time! We made inoculum in liquid medium LB with ampicillin 100ug/ml of DH5α without modified genetics as “blank” and DH5α with plasmid p26G for high GFP’s expression, as positive control tomorrow!! Lets go!!!
