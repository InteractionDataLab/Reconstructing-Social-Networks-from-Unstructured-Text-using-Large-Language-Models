Today we have performed a Plasmidial DNA extraction of JM110 and E0840. We have also checked the electrophoretic profile of all our samples, to keep it for when it’s needed.
Eletrophoretical profile display:
1: E0840 extracted with DH5α
2: K346004extracted with DH5α
3: K346004 extra with Kit of JM110
4: E0840 extracted of JM110 electrocompetent (Colônia 1)
5. E0840 extracted JM110 eletrocompetent (Colony 2)
6. E0840 extracted of JM110 electrocompetent (Colony 13)
7. E0840 extracted with Kit of  JM110 eletrocompetent (Colony 13)
8. E0840 extracted with Kit of JM110  chemical competent
Today we also digested all the samples above with XbaI and PstI, to analyse the cut and the size of the fragment. In theory, Xbal is not supposed to cut its restriction sites from the samples extracted of DH5α. Taking into account that it’s not dam negative. We will see if we can remove the dam methylation from our DNAs so that we could work in our constructions!!!!
Digestion system (XbaI and PstI) 1 hour at 37°C
- 18ul of  Water
- 1ul of DNA
- 1ul of Endonucleases
- 5ul of NEB 3 buffer
Eletrophoretical display of the digested samples:
1: DH5a + E0840
2. DH5a + K346004
3. JM110 + K346004
4. JM110 + E0840 colony 1
5. JM110 + E0840 colony 2
6. JM110 + E0840 colony 13
7. JM110 + E0840 extracted of  colony 13 kit
8. JM110 + E0840 extracted from the kit
And today we have also taught a course for High School from Iranduba (a city, from our state, Amazonas).
We are cooperating with a project created by Prof. Karime Rita, that has the goal to insert students from small cities into the state’s universities.
It’s very nice and we are delighted to be able to collaborate with it!!!
