Pictures of our trials using antibiotic on JM110 and ERC2925 E. coli ER5C2925 – Trial with Streptomycin, in order: 20 ug/ml, 40 ug/ml, 100 ug/ml and 150 ug/ml:
ER5C2925 – Trials with Ampicillin: 50ug/ml and 100ug/ml:
ER5C2925 – Trials with Tetracycline: 12 ug/ml and 24 ug/ml:
ER5C2925 – Trials with Kanamycin: 25 ug/ml and 50 ug/ml:

Today we also cryopreserved the bacteria with glycerol and was inoculated in LB soft medium to store them.
We transformed using the Transformation Protocol, using Sorbitol on E. coli JM110 and ERC2925 with the pUC72 plasmid.
