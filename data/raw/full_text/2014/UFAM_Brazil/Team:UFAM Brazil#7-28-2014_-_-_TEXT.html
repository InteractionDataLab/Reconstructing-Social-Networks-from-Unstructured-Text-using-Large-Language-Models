Today we are going to test our enzymes with their buffers to build our biobricks!  We’ll digest E0840 with EcoRI, SpeI, XbaI, PstI  using the following digestion system:
Final volume of 10ul and  digestion at 37°C for 1 hora.
The result was great!!!! EcoRI  Works very well with either Buffer 1 or Buffer 2 from New England Biolabs. SpeI e XbaI had a great performance with Buffer 2 and PstI great performance with Buffer 3!!!! =)
