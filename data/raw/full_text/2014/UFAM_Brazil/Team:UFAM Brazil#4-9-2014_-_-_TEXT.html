Lots of work for members in charge of the project’s development! We continue the analysis from operon mer:
- The genes that exist in the lines of Escherichia coli and we aligned the sequences.
- Escherichia coli’s lines that we currently have in our lab and check if they the genes from operon mer or not.
- The existence of restriction sites of the genes using NEB.
- The cloning vectors and the restriction sites currently available in our laboratory.
- The protocols and methodologies for culture media with mercury.
