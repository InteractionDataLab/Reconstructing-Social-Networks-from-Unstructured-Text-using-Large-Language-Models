The digestion did not work well, because there wasn't enough DNA.  We decided to change.
Digestion system (XbaI and PstI) 1 hour at 37°C
- 18ul of Water
- 2ul of DNA
- 1ul of endonucleases
- 5ul of NEB 3 buffer
Eletrophoretical profile of the digested samples:
1. DH5a E0840
2. JM110 E0840 colony 1
3. JM110 E0840 colony 2
4. JM110 E0840 colony13
5. JM110 E0840 extracted from theKit
6. JM110 E0840 colony 13  extracted with the Kit
7. DH5a K346004
8. JM110 K346004
We ran the reaction once again in the same location.
Eletrophoretical profile of the digested sample:
Based on the eletrophoretical profile we have come to a conclusion that has been a partial digestion.
