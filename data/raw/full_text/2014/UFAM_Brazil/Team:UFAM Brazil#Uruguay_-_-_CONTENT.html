It can be a tool to compare the growth of synthetic biology around the world. The Synthetic Biology project began in 2009, and received an update in 2013 and has been updated based on available publications in official sites, in scientific, articles literatures. However, this field is very dynamic and the map is a continuous work. A new update, in the website will be launched soon, opening the possibility to evaluate the advance of synthetic biology during those years. The map shows that in the area where Uruguay is located, no activity was found.</P><H3 align="center">PARTICIPATION IN THE iGEM COMPETITION</H3><P>	In Uruguay there is no record of iGEM participation.</P><H3 align="center">BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND FUNDS </H3><P>In the report of Human Development in Uruguay prepared by the United Nations Development Program (UNPD) in 2005, 32 biotechnology industries were identified, from which 11 suppliers of specialized products and services, which has a total of 43 listed companies were identified. In addition, 71 entities were identified technology and innovation (Uruguaio, 2012).</P><P>As part of the industrial strategy, the Bio and Nanotechnology Border was launched in order to prioritize and implement measures to improve the sector identified by the border in 2009. After the border’s production in 2009, where measures were identified to terminate the restrictions related to the growth of the nano and biotechnonology sectors in Uruguay, in June 22th of 2010, the Sectoral Border on Nano and Biotechnology was launched. The Border is made up of employers, employees and technicians from the public sector, it is a tool of articulation inputs e policies making in the sector. The first product of the Border in 2011 was the development of a sector plan that defines the main strategic  industry guidance and the tools for the implementation of the measures identified and prioritized in this subject (<I>Consejo</I> Sectorial de <I>Biotecnología</I>, 2012).</P><H3 align="center">REGULATIONS FOR SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY</H3><P>In mid-2011 began Sector Strategic Plan, developed under the Sectoral Council of Biotechnology (CSBT), with the participation of 25 companies representing public and private institutions. The plan addresses a number of issues and gives particular emphasis on the definition of a state policy for the growth of biotechnology that allows develop coordinated public policies and sustained over time, in order to facilitate the industry's growth.</P><P>The development of a bill that deals with the mechanisms and legal instruments to promote the sector is currently being worked on.That is,an integrated regulatory system that sets out the guiding principles and general rules,and definitions of the Strategic Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation, but nothing dedicated exclusively to the field of synthetic biology (Uruguayan Government 2012).</P><H3 align="center">RESEARCH, PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATION</H3><P>It is clear the impact that science has had on society and  more open lines of research findings and new appear as well as new problems are topics of conversation of citizens. However, despite this decontextualized view of science is presented in society appears as something neutral, oblivious of the implications of their occurrence. This neutral view does not consider the evolution of knowledge, know the difficulties and  what obstacles to overcome to obtain improved knowledge</P><P>Since 2008, the sectors of bio and nanotechnology have been identified as priorities by the Office Productive within the definition of industrial development strategy. During 2008 and 2009, the chassis products work in characterizing the chains and the identification of policy measures to lift restrictions on its growth. This work was carried out, in turn, part of the strategic guidelines and to comply with the goals set in 2007 by PENCTI. In parallel, since 2005, the program PACPYMES (MEMBER / EU) launched the initiative of the cluster &quot;Life Sciences&quot; to work in the promotion and strengthening of bio-business in Uruguay. In particular, the program contributed to the reorganization and consolidation of the union of the biotechnology industry, the Uruguayan Association of Biotechnology Companies (AUDEBIO). Following these lines of work, June 22, 2010, was released Tripartite Sectoral Council Bio and Nanotechnology as a tool to articulate and generate inputs for the policy sector. Noteworthy is the deepening of relations between academia and the public sector, which is very good, but should be intensified (Consejo Sectorial del Gabinete Productivo 2014).</P><P>Clearly the impact that science has had on society is so that big  more and more open lines of research findings and new appear as well as new problems are topics of conversation of citizens. However, despite this decontextualized view of science is presented in society appears as something neutral, oblivious of the implications of their occurrence. This neutral view does not consider the evolution of knowledge, know what are the difficulties and obstacles to overcome to obtain improved knowledge. </P><H3 align="center"> EVENTS RELATED TO SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY </H3><P>The development potential of synthetic biology in Uruguay has been stimulated by activities with entrepreneurs, public sector representatives and researchers in biotechnology. This has provided an initial stage to extend this knowledge where experts from the region will impact the introduction of synthetic biology in production chains in neighboring countries and their current situation in Uruguay. Then be searched for by an instance of group work, the participants' perception about the development potential of the area in the country and its potential transfer to industry.</P><H3 style="align:center">References</H3><P>Consejo Sectorial del Gabinete Productivo 2014. <A href="http://gp.gub.uy/en/node/188/4" target="_blank">(Link)</A></P><P>Governo Uruguaio 2012 - Plan Estratégico Sectorial impulsa biotecnología para favorecer desarrollo productivo.<A href="http://www.presidencia.gub.uy/wps/wcm/connect/Presidencia/PortalPresidencia/comunicacion/comunicacionNoticias/MIEM-biotecnologia" target="_blank">(Link)</A></P><P>Consejo Sectorial de Biotecnología 2012 – Gabinete Productivo. <A href="http://gp.gub.uy/sites/default/files/llamados/llamado_consejo_sectorial_biotecnologia_esutdio_de_mercado_420.pdf" target="_blank">(Link)</A></P><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:UFAM_Brazil/CountryProfile">Back</A><DIV class="printfooter">
