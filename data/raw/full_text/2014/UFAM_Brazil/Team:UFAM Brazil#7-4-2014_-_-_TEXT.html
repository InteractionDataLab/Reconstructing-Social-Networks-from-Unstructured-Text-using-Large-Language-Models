The strains of E. coli JM110 and ERC2925 grew in solid LB media!!
Today we tested it for antibiotics in different concentrations. We already knew that JM110 is resistant to streptomycin and ERC2925 is resistant to streptomycin and Kanamycin.
We tested the following antibiotics and its concentrations: Ampicillin 50ug/ml and 100 ug/ml; Kanamycin 25 ug/ml and 50 ug/ml; Tetracycline 12 ug/ml and 24 ug/ml; Chloramphenicol 34 ug/ml and 68 ug/ml; Streptomycin 20 ug/ml, 40 ug/ml, 100 ug/ml and 150 ug/ml.
We also made inoculum of E. coli JM110 and ERC2925 in liquid LB with/without antibiotic.
