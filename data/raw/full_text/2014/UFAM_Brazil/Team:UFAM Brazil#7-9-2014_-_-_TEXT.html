The transformation with pUC72  using approximately 1.000 ng/ul and 1 ng/ul worked!! But our transformation with the DNA diluted from the  Kit  Parts 2013 (BBa_E0840) didn’t grow any transforming cells!!! =(
Today we decided to work on the transformation once again with Escherichia coli DH5α RR1 using Transformation Efficiency Kit as a control and DNA diluted from DNAa Parts Kit 2013 (BBa_E0840), using iGEM’s standard transformation protocol. We have to be very careful!!!!
We also had a big meeting with all our team members.
