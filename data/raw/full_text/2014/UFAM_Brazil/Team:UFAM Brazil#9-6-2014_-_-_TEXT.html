Today we discussed the new Hg concentrations that we’re going to use for our biosensor and bioaccumulation for reasons discussed previously. (Any doubt, access September 1st and 5th ).
We started to do total DNA extraction from wild bacteria that present resistance to high Hg concentrations. We used the method phenol-chloroform and because it takes a really long time, we couldn’t finish today! We let DNA sample precipitating in NaCl 0,3M and Ethanol 70% to keep working on it on following days. We’re out of competent bacteria! So we need more to proceed with new bio brick’s construction. We made pre inoculum of DH5α today.
