Tomorrow we’re going to do the final test with the bioaccumulation construction (BB_Essential + K346004). So we discussed the procedures and let the material ready. Besides that, we tested if our construction BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation grows at higher concentrations beyond the ones tested before (20µg/ml). So we plated those colonies in LM medium on Hg concentrations of 50 µg/ml, 70 µg/ml and 100 µg/ml.
We also continued the validation and characterization of our parts regarding to molecular-genetic. Back again to the rigorous digestions using the following system for BB_Essential e BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation:
Electrophoretic digestion’s profile of BB_Essential:
1:BB_Essential in PSB1C3 not digested
2: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 digested with EcoRI.
3: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 digested with PstI
4: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 digested with EcoRI and PstI
