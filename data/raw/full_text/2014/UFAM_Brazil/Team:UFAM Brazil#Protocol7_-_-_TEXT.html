BioBrick Restriction Digest
Reagents:
- dsH2O;
- 10x Buffer (1 – 2 – 3 – 4);
- 10x BSA;
- Restriction Enzymes (EcoRI, Xbal, SpeI, PstI);
- DNA.
Steps:
1. Make a master mix with everything except the DNA.  Make sure that:
• The final concentration of BSA and buffer is 1x.
• 5 to 10 enzyme’s unit are necessary for 1 µg plasmidial DNA digest.
• Add to digest system the quantity of DNA enough for 0.5 – 1 µg. If the system will be purified from the agarose gel lately, add quantity of DNA for the digest system of 1 – 2 µg.
2. Pipet aliquots to each sample tube and add DNA.
3. Incubate at 37°C for 2 – 3 hours. Check the eletrophorectic profile.
