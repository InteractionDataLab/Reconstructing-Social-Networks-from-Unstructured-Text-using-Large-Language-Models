ONLY 7 DAYS TO DEADLINE WIKI FREEZE!
Hey there! Today we finished the team introduction’s banner and sent it to iGEM! We made the graphs for cell growth of Mercury Bacter bioremediation in medium with Hg, aiming to evidence the difference regarding to cell growth between Escherichia coli modified and non-modified for bioremediation containing our bio brick BBa_K1355000!
And those are the results:
Figure 1: Cell growth of Mercury Bacter in different Hg concentrations in function of time;
Figure 2: Cell growth of control bacteria in different Hg concentrations in function of time
