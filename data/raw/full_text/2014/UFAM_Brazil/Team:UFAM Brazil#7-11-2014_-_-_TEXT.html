The colonies   from yesterday’s transformation have grown, we have a problem though, THE NEGATIVE CONTROL HAS ALSO GROWN!!!We found out the reason why our results weren’t satisfactory: The antibiotic concentration was too low (20ug/ml of chloranphenical), but the transformations did not result in colonies.
In order to get more accurate and satisfactory results we are going to perform the transformations in the RR1 line once again by doing the following:
- Negative Control, no DNA;
- Positive Control from the Transformation Efficiency Kit;
- BBa_E0840 (Biodetection Biobrick);
- BBa_K346004 (Bioaccumulation Biobrick).
We have followed iGEM’s Transformation Protocol  LB plates – agar with 34ug/ml of chloranphenicol.
We are waiting for our synthesis to arrive!!!
