Hello! Today we continued with the new constructions, transformed again JM110 with mRFP generator K516030 to take it off the dam methylation,because we’re having troubles!
About the parts ready and sequenced (BB_Essential, BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential + E0840 and BB_Essential + K346004), we’re discussing and studying methods for mercury quantification for our bio accumulator and bioremediation, as well as Green Fluorescent Protein quantification to our biosensor!
