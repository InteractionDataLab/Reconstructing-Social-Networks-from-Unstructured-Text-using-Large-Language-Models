Heeeyy!! Today we made plasmid extraction with kit JM110, and DH5α with Biobrick for bioremediation and essential Biobrick.
Eletrophoretical profile of samples
scho
1. Biobrick Essential extracted from DH5α (1)
2. Biobrick Essential extracted from (2)
3. Biobrick for bioremediation exctracted from JM110 (1)
4. Biobrick for bioremediation exctracted from JM110 (2)
After extraction, the samples were digested with EcoRI and PstI to check fragment's size of Essential Biobrick and Biorremediation Biobrick. For this we used the following system for enzymatic digestion:
The digestion took 2 hours at 37°C. We applied the total volume of each sample in agarose gel 0.8%.
Eletrophoretical profile of the digested samples:
1. Bioremediation Biobrick not digested.
2. Bioremediation Biobrick digested with EcoRI and PstI
3. Essential Biobrick not digested.
4. Essential Biobrick digested with EcoRI and PstI.
5-6-7-8. Plasmids did not show a good extraction
Hurray!!!  The digestion released fragments. It proves the viability of our beloved biobricks! Bioremediation Biobrick has  1.823  base  pairs and Essential Biobrick has 1.234 base pairs,that’s why BB_Biorremediation sits above BB_Essential in the gel. =)
We have also analyzed samples 5-6-7-8 that wasn't digested or showed partial digestion (Either didn't present digestion or partial digestion).
