Today’s result was clear: after trying to transform for three times now, we found out that E. coli RR1 suffered a mutation that made it resistant to chloramphenicol, selectable marker from the pSB1C3. We lost time and lots of microliters of the diluted DNA from 2013 Parts kit! We lost a precious amount of time but the result was gratifying.
After having this sorted out, we discussed the best method to make DH5α chemical competent.  We decided to use the methods given by Professor Spartaco.
We made a pre-inoculum in liquid LB media!
