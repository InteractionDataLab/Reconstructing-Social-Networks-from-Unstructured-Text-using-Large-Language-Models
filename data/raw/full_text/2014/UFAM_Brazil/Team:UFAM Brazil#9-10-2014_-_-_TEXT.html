Heeello!! =) Today we transformed JM110 with bio brick mRFP generator K516030, cloned before in DH5α. We also transferred DH5α with promoter 1 (K611025) in PSB1C3 and promoter 3 (J23100) in J61002.
To start induced by mercury GFP quantification, we need a positive control. For that we will use DH5α with p26G plasmid (it has a strong promoter for late GFP expression).
p26G plasmid physical map.
So, today we transformed DH5α with plasmid p26G! =)
We also continued wild bacteria’s identification and isolation. Yesterday, on electrophoretic profile of total DNA from these bacteria and we could see plasmids presence! Because of this, we made inoculum today in LB medium to do miniprep tomorrow!
Today... (Phew!! We made a lot of things!) we also had the sequencing results of our first biobricks (BB_Essential, BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential + E0840 and BB_Essential + K346004). We started to process information, making alignments between the sequenced bio bricks and the original sequences!! =)
