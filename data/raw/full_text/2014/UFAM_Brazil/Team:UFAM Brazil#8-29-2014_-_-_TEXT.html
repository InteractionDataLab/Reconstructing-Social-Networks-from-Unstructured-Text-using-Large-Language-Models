Today it was our first test with mercury!
The team had a short discussion about how to add mercury to medium. Based in articles, we decided to do, what we call LM (medium Lúria-Bertani + mercury chloride). Taking it from the stock solution, we added 400 µL of mercury to LB medium (peptone 10 g/L, yeast extract 5 g/L and NaCl 5 g/L and, in case of solid medium we added 15 g/L of bacterial agar, pH 7,0 - 7,4) at the concentration of 20 µIg/mL. We chose just this concentration because our objective now is to know if the bacteria can resist metal only with bio bricks. If it does, the mercury values will be adjusted for other tests.
We made an inoculum in LM 20ug/ml:
- Using only DH5a, without resistance to Hg.
- DH5a with BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3
- DH5a with BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3
- DH5a with BB_Essential + E0840 in PSB1C3
- DH5a with BB_Essential + K346004 in PSB1C3
To be our positive control, we also made an inoculum in LM 20ug/ml a sample from a stream in Manaus, called “40” (a stream that is known for being polluted with industries residuals) and Negro River. We named these samples A1, A2, A,3, A4; E1, E2; P1, P2, P3; S1.
