Today we returned to the laboratory of Mineral Analyzes on CPRM to make our calibration curve that will work as a pattern for mercury quantification on experiments with constructions of the binding protein to mercury (MBP):
Besides that, we also decided to digest each bio brick to be submitted for the competition in a more rigorous way. Starting with BB_Bioremediation, with the following system:
Electrophoretic digestion profile of BB_Bioremediation:
1 : BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 not digested
2: BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 digested with EcoRI
3: BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 digested with PstI
4: BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 digested with EcoRI and PstI
5 : BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 digested with Xba
6: BB_Bioremediation in PSBK from JM110 digested with Xba
7: BB_Bioremediation in PSBK from JM110 digested with Spe
8: BB_Bioremediation in PSBK from JM110 digested with Xba + Spe.
