Today we’re doing colonies’ PCR to confirm if our fragment was cloned on PSB1C3. We selected:
6 colonies of DH5a with BB_Essential in PSB1C3.
4 colonies of DH5a with BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3.
6 colonies of DH5a with BB_Bioremediation + BB_Essential in PSB1C3!
We used the following system:
Used primers: VR, VF2, for PSB1C3.
Electrophoretic PCR’s profile:
1– 4: BB_Bioremediation in PS1BC3
5 – 10: BB_Essential in PSB1C3
11 – 16: BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PS1BC3.
Yaaaayyy! BB_Bioremediation and BB_Essential were amplified, with the size we wanted. Now we have our bio bricks cloned separately in PSB1C3! Unfortunately BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation wasn’t amplified.
We made inoculum of the amplified colonies 2 and 3 from BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3; 2 and 4 from BB_Essential. Also – just out of curiosity – we made an inoculum of samples 1 and 4 from BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation.
