Hello, dear reader! Remember we had a tricky question again? Here is the solution!
Electrophoretic profile of  BB_Essential in PSB1C3 digested with EcoRI and EcoRI + PstI
1: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 not digested, extracted from colony 3
2: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 digested with EcoRI extracted from colony 3
3: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 digested with EcoRI and PstI extracted from colony 3
YEEEEEEAAAAAHHH!!! It is right!!! Our fragment (1.823 base pairs) shows about the same size as PSB1C3 (2.070 base pais), making the separation on gel difficult. We can confirm this because the linear vector has the sum of bio brick and vector! Super cool!! It even started to separate a little bit!!
We have our firsts bio bricks ready!! We are really happy!! Tomorrow will be the first test with mercury!
