Today we had a super meeting to show our results for the entire team and advisors. We are super happy!!
As we showed previously, all of our constructions are concluded!!! We are now transfering some of them to PSB1C3.
After the meeting, we transformed the BB_Essential binding in PSB1C3, BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 and BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3!!!
We also prepared our first chloride mercury solution at the iGEM-UFAM_Brazil lab!!! For the preparation we added 200 mg of Mercury chloride II (HgCl2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%, M1136) in 10 mL of deionized water.
