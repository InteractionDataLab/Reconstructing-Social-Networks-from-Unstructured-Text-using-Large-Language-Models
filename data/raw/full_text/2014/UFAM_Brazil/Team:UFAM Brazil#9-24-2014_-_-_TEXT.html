Today we went to know the laboratory of Mineral analyzes of Geological Service in Brazil (CPRM – Companhia de Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais/ Company of Mineral Resources’ Research) and the equipment that will tell us if our bioaccumulation Mercury Bacter takes Hg from the medium. The DMA - 80 (Direct Mercury Analyzer) is an equipment capable of detect and quantify the total mercury presence in samples with a minimum limit of 0.02ng.
Before getting any samples measurements on DMA, we must do a calibration curve before, where will have patterns of analyzed mercury quantity in form of a graph, where it will also show dots correspondent to mercury quantities on our gene constructions samples.
But, the equipment wasn’t working properly, requiring a technical calibration so we can make our calibration curve later.
