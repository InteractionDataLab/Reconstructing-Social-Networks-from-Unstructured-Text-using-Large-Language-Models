Today we had a meeting with the Secretary of Sustainable Development of Amazon.  So freaking cooll!!
We also had a magna meeting!!! With all of our team members.
Transformation has finally worked!!!!!! Our biobricks were finally cloned into the bacteria!
- DH5α with BBa_E0840 – pSB1C3 (Biodetection Biobrick);
- DH5α with BBa_K346004 – pSB1C3 (Bioaccumulation biobrick).
- DH5α with positive control pUC72
Today we are going to inoculate the transformation in liquid LB media chloranphenicol 34ug/ml for miniprep purposes. We’re also going to inoculate JM110 with streptomycin 40ug/ml.
For the genetic constructions we are going to use the Xbal enzyme. To achieve this we need DNA without methylation dam. We cloned the bacteria into the (DH5α) dam positive, but we’re still going to transform the multiplied and concentrated plasmid into JM110, so that it will lose its methylation in the Xbal restriction sites.
