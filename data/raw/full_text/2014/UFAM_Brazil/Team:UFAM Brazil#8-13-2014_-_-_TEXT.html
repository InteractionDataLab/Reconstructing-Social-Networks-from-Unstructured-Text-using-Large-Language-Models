Heeeyyy!!! The transformations of the BB_Essential + K346004 e BB_Essential + E0840 greeeew!!!! We plated aiming to obtain isolated bacteria colonies to do miniprep! However, unfortunately, the binding transformation with BB_Essential + K346004 didn’t grow. We concentrated the binding system and transformed again through eletroporation in DH5α. Now it will work!
