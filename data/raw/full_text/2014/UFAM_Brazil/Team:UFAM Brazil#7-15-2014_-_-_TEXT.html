Transformation Day =)
We made chemically competent cells with DH5α and we transformed it with:
- Negative Control, no DNA;
- Positive Control with pUC72;
- BBa_E0840 – pSB1C3 (Biodetection Biobrick);
- BBa_K346004 – pSB1C3 (Bioaccumulation Biobrick).
We used chloramphenicol’s concentrations in 34 ug/ml plates.
Studying hard to find a way to produce culture media with Mercury Chloride!!!!
