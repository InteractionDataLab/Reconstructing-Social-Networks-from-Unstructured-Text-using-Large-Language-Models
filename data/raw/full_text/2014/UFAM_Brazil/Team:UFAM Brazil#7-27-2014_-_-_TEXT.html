Today we made digestion of the biobricks K346004 and E0840 extracted from JM110  with endonucleases XbaI and PstI,using the following digestion system:
Digestion System for K346004 and E0840 - 2 hours at 37°C:
Today, by prof. Spartaco Astolfi’s advice, instead of using NEB 3 buffer, recommended for double digestion with XbaI and PstI, we mixed buffers 2 and 3, to enhance digestion’s performance. We also added BSA!
1. E0840 not digested
2. E0840 digested with XbaI and PstI
3. K346004 not digested
4. K346004 digested with XbaI and PstI
It worked!!!
We know that digestion worked, because of the fragment's size after cutting with XbaI and  PstI. It was compatible with the biobrick. The size of the biobrick E0840 is 902 base pairs and K346004 is 502  base pairs.
