Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry. A new application of, and outstanding documentation, of a previously existing BioBrick part in the 'Experience' page of that part's Registry entry also counts. Submitted parts: BBa_K1355000 , BBa_K1355001 , BBa_K1355002 , BBa_K1355003 and BBa_K1355004 .
