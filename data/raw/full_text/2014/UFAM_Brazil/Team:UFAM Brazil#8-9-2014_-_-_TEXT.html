Heeeyy!!  Today is digestion day! We’ll digest Bioremediation Biobrick with EcoRI and XbaI to linearize, and the Essential Biobrick with EcoRI and SpeI  to release the insert need. We used the following system:
The digestion lasted 2 horas at 37°C.  The amount used in the gel was 10ul for each sample and 40 ul  was  kept  frozen at -20°C  to be purified later.
Eletrophoretical profile of the digested samples:
1. Bioremediation Biobrick not  digested
2. Bioremediation Biobrick digested with EcoRI and XbaI
3. Essential Biobrick not digested
4. EssentialBiobrick digested withEcoRI and SpeI
♥ OMG!!It looks so pretty! ♥
Analysing the profile we concluded that  sample number 2 is linearized (and pretty!) and that sample number 4 released a fragment of 1.234  base pairs (even prettier!).
We ran the rest of the micro liters from the digestion (40ul)  in another gel just to get the DNA  purified.
We isolated the DNA we wanted through agarose gel  0,8%  and purified it. After we analyzed the purification, the electrophoretic profile of the samples of Bioremediation  Biobrick  digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and the Essential Biobrick digested with   EcoRI and SpeI.  We applied 10ul of the sample in 0,8%  agarose gel.
Electrophoretical profile of the samples, digested and purified:
1. Bioremediation Biobrick linearized with EcoRI and XbaI
2. EssentialBiobrick digested with EcoRI and SpeI.
We could analyze through  the electrophoretical profile that the samples have the size we were looking for!!! Unfortunately,  we lost a bit of DNA during purification in the gel, mainly in the Bioremediation Biobrick sample.
Now all we have to do is binding!!!!! Tomorrow is debate day to develop the strategy to bind our biobricks!!!
