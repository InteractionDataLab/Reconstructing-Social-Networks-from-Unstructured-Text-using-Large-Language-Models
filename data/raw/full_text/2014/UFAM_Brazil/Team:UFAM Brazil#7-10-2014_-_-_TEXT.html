The transformed colonies of Escherichia coli DH5α and RR1 with Biobrick Transformation Efficiency Kit as control and the diluted DNA from the 2013 DNA Part Kit (BBa_E0840) greeeew!!!!  Although we were not sure if we could trust in the results. We made an inoculum using  liquid LB medium from transformed cells (BBa_E0840 and Transformation Efficiency Kit) to make a miniprep  and check the electrophoretical profile of the transformation. To get more satisfactory results we are going to repeat the transformation process only with lineage RR1, shown next :
- Negative control - no DNA;
- Positive control from the Transformation Efficiency Kit;
- BBa_E0840 (Biodetection Biobrick);
- BBa_K346004 (Bioaccumulation Biobrick).
We followed iGEM’s Transformation Protocol.  LB plates – agar with 20ug/ml of chloranphenicol.
Waiting for our synthesis to arrive!!
