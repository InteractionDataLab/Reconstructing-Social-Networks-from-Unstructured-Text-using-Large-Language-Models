Hellooo! Today we started to measure mercury quantity accumulated by DH5α with our construction BB_Essential + K346004 on concentrations of 0.5 ug/ml; 0.25 ug/ml; 0.1ug/ml; 0.05ug/ml, using DMA - 80 (Direct Mercury Analyzer) equipment. As was shown on previous days, September 24th, 29th and October 1st. The samples take about to 10 min to be measured and we couldn’t conclude today!
