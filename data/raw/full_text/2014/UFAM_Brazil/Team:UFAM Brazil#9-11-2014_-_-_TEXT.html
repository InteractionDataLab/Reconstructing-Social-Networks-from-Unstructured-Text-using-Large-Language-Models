Hello, iGEMer!! =) What’s up? Today we had a meeting with the entire team to discuss about our human practices, wiki and bench! We also took many pictures to put on our wiki page! Super cool!
On lab, we made a new miniprep of our bio bricks (BB_Essential, BB_Bioremediation, BB_Essential + E0840 and BB_Essential + K346004) to send it to competition.
Plasmid DNA extraction of bio bircks:
1: BB_Essential in PSB1C3 extracted from DH5α
2: BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 extracted from DH5α
3: BB_Essential + BB_Bioremediation in PSB1C3 extracted from DH5α
4: BB_Essential + E0840 in PSB1C3 extracted from DH5α
5: BB_Essential + K346004 in PSB1C3 extracted from DH5α
Regarding to the new constructions, our transformation of JM110 with bio brick mRFP generator K516030 grew up!! We made inoculum in LB medium to make miniprep tomorrow.
Today we also continued the identification and isolation of wild bacteria (from contaminated stream and from Negro River). We made plasmid DNA extraction – because on total DNA extraction it appeared a plasmid (see September 9th ). Lets see!!!
Plasmid DNA extraction from wild bacteria resistant to high Hg concentrations:
1: Sample A1* collected from Negro River
2: Sample A2* collected from Negro River
3: Sample E1* collected from contaminated stream
4: Sample E2 collected from contaminated stream
5: Sample P1* collected from contaminated stream
6: Sample P2 collected from contaminated stream
7: Sample P3 collected from contaminated stream
8: Sample S1* collected from contaminated stream
*Resistant to 100ug/ml of Hg.
Many plasmids and many different conformations! ^_^
Tomorrow we’re going to do PCR of 16S rRNA!! :D
