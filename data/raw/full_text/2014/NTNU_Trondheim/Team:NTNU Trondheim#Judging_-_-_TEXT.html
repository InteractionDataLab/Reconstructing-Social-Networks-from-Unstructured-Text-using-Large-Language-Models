The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
See our attributions page.
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
See BBa_K1424000 , BBa_K1424001 , BBa_K1424002 , BBa_K1424003 , BBa_K1424004 and BBa_K1424005 .
Silver
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your design and construction works as expected.
Two homologous recombination sequences for integration of specific DNA into a specified site within the genome via double homologous recombination were created and worked as expected ( BBa_K1424000 and BBa_K1424001 ).
Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.

Gold
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry.
Improved the function of a previously documented part ( BBa_K300989 ) to make it compatible with iGEM assembly standards RFC10, 12, 23, 25 and 1000 (the previous part was incompatible with all iGEM assembly standards), and also optimised the promoter and RBS for use in the host organism Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. New biobrick has the part number BBa_K1424003 .
