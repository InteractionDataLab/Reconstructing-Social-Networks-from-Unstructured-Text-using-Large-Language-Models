Synechocystis medium
Recipe
{{{tech}}}
To grow Synechocystis cultures, BG-11 medium was made according to the recipe found on the PhotoSynLab wiki .
Gibson Assembly
{{{tech}}}
The Gibson assembly protocol can be found at New England Biolabs .
DNA isolation and cleaning
{{{tech}}}
For plasmid isolation, the Promega Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System A1460 Miniprep protocol was used. For PCR product isolation, the  QIAquick PCR Purification kit was used.
DNA digestion
{{{tech}}}
DNA digests for both ligation and verification used the protocol in the PhotoSynLab wiki .
PCR
{{{tech}}}
The touchdown PCR procedure detailed on the PhotoSynLab wiki was used to amplify DNA.
Nanodrop
{{{tech}}}
A NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer was used to determine DNA concentrations.
3A assembly
{{{tech}}}
3A assembly was conducted according to the iGEM 3A assembly protocol .
Ligation
{{{tech}}}
Ligation was performed according to the protocol outlined on the PhotoSynLab wiki .
Transformation (Escherichia coli)
{{{tech}}}
The protocols used for preparing competent DH5a cells, as well as the heat-shock transformation procedure employed can be found at the PhotoSynLab wiki .
Transformation (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803)
{{{tech}}}
The transformation procedure for transforming Synechocystis can be found at the PhotoSynLab wiki .

DNA concentration
{{{tech}}}
After measuring the concentration of a sample of DNA in ng/ul with the NanoDrop method, the concentration in terms of pmolar could be determined with the equation
