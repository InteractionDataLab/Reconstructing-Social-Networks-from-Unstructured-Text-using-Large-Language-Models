Project
We have constructed BioBricks that allow the insertion of transgenes into Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Working with photosynthetic organisms such as Synechocystis can help in the generation of environmental innovations.
We hope that our BioBricks can encourage and make it easier for future teams to work with Synechocystis and other photosynthetic organisms.
