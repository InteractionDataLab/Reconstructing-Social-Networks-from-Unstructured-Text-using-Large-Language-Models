Attributions
Project
All work on the project was carried out by members of NTNU_Trondheim's student team. This includes lab work, modelling, design and human practices.
Wiki
We would like to thank Cornell's iGEM team for being generous enough to let us base our wiki on theirs. Adapting it to our use has been both challenging and educating, and I hope the end result is something you are satisfied with.
Wet lab
Thank you to the Department of Biotechnology at NTNU for providing us with lab space and reagents for our wet lab experiments.
Sequencing
Gene sequencing was performed by GATC Biotech .
