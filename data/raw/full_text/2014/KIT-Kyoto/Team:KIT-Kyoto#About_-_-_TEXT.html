About KIT
KIT, Kyoto Institute of Technology, is a national university in Kyoto, which had been the capital city of Japan for more than a thousand years. KIT was founded to do research on silk and textile, important for artistic kimono industries for Kyoto.   Though its name has 'technology' in it, KIT is a fusion of science and arts. KIT has been committed in the genetics more recently. A good example is the Drosophila Genetic Resource Center (DGRC) , an essential model organism in life science research, from laboratories around the world. There are only two other such centers in the world. The institute has also collaborated actively with industries in Kyoto and beyond.   KIT's competence is beyond science. It also has arts and design courses.   KIT is a place of robust science and creative arts. We will exert our strength as students of KIT. We are very proud of competing with wonderful students in other universities in iGEM. We will show you what you will get when arts and science merge. See you in Boston!
