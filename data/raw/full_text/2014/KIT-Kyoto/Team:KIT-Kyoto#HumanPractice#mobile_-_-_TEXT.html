Japanese Website
In addition to this Team Wiki website, we opened another website in Japanese . iGEM is the world largest competition in synthetic biology in which nine other teams from Japan also participate. But if you look beyond the iGEM community, it is not widely known in Japan. Even some of our team members had never heard about it when they decided to join it. This website written in our local language will PR iGEM widely in Japan. People in Japan will be interested in iGEM and more broadly in synthetic biology.

If you don't have a website compatible with mobile devices, you may be missing out on the chance to spread buzz about your team’s activities. Mobile phone screen sizes are relatively small so browsing websites designed for large monitors on smartphones involves a lot of zooming in and out, panning, and shuffling around. When people look at regular websites on mobile devices such as iPhones and Androids, normal websites do not show up correctly. We frequently see this happening on Wiki pages of iGEM teams. Elaborate colorful website filled with interesting information and activities are so compressed that they are illegible. What a pity! Therefore we designed our website separately for mobile devices to make the best use of the small screen. It is friendly to your thumb and eyes. URL is the same for PCs and smartphones. Our Wiki page automatically chooses and offers the optimum interface by identifying whether your device is a PC or a smartphone. Adapting a website for mobile users allows for easier reading, longer time on the site and more repeat visits - all of which are important to get the message across.
