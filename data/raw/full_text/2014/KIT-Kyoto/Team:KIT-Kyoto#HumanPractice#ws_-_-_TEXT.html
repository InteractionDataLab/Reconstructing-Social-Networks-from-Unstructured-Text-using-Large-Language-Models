Workshop
September 16, 17, 18, 2014
An intensive course, Where Science encounters Arts: BioArt: Painting with E. coli ink, was held at KIT. iGEM members served as TAs and gave lectures on BioArt. Participating students first learned how to cultivate GFP expressing E. coli, formulate the ink and in the subsequent workshop they created their artwork on their own.
Day 1:  A lecture on the basics of science of BioArt and how to actually create BioArt work.
Day 2:  Students created their own artwork in groups.
Day 3:  Critiques of the works and an announcement of awardees.
Groups in workshop consisted of students of biology major and those of design major. Students of biology major were thrilled to see artistic works. For most of the design course students, this was the first time to learn about biology. They were excited to exchange inputs from different perspectives. BioArt served as an excellent tool to connect them with biology. The participants told us how they enjoyed and were thrilled with BioArt.
