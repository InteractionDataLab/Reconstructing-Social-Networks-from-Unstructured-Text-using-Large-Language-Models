High School Visit
August 26 and September 22, 2014
Our team members visited middle and high schools some of us graduated in Osaka and Shiga prefectures and gave the students lectures about iGEM and what our team is doing. We designed the lecture so that younger students can fully engaged in and understand, in a sit back and relaxed atmosphere. Before the lecture, the students said genetic engineering is something unknown worrisome. So we specifically talked about what it is and how safe it can be, without using too many terminologies.
