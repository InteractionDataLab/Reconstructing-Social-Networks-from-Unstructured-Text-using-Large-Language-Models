About Our Lab
1
Does your country use a four-part "Safety Level" rating system for laboratories? (The system might be called in English "Risk Levels", "Bio-Safety Levels", "Containment Levels", "Bio-Security Levels", or some similar name.)  If yes, which level is used for the most dangerous organisms?
Yes. Level 4 is used for the most dangerous organisms. (True for most countries in Asia, the European Union, and North/South America. This is equivalent to the WHO system.)
What is the Safety Level of your lab? (Use the WHO numbering system, in which Level 4 is used for the most dangerous organisms.)
Level 1 (low risk, ~= WHO BSL 1)
