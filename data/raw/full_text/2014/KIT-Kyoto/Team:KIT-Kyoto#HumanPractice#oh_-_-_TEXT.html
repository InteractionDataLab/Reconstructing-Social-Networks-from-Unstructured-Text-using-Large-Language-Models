Open House
August 8 and 9, 2014
At Open House for future students and their guardians, we set up a booth on iGEM. At the booth we had slide presentations about what iGEM is and what we are doing in iGEM. We also had mini lectures for small groups with posters. Visitors could look at E. coli and S. cerevisiae through a microscope and E. coli glowing with GFP protein expression. E. coli and limonene were displayed to smell the difference.
For many of them, this must be the first time to get in touch with genetic engineering. These firsthand experience will boost their familiarity with the subject. The trophies and certificates we got in the past were also displayed, to emphasize the fun of participating in a competition and to trigger an interest among high school students. We asked all of the visitors to fill in the survey about genetic engineering. We invited more than 200 students to the booth.
