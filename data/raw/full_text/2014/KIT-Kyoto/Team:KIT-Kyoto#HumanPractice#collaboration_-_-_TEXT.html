Meeting via Skype
Aug 7, 2014 7:00a.m. (JT)
We had a meeting with National University of Colombia in Colombia via Skype. We had received a request from the university for collaboration in outreach through our official twitter account. They were investigating how inexpensive and easy iGEM procedures can be done. They hoped to collect comparable data from other universities around the world. We responded to their questionnaires. We asked for their inputs in return. They answered our survey of genetic engineering.
