Submitted Parts
We received from Dr. Shimada beta-pinene, d-limonene and γ-terpinene synthase genes of Citrus unshiu and submitted the γ-terpinene synthase gene to iGEM. Monoterpene is extracted mainly from plants and used for cosmetics and as flavors. It has many useful properties with high potential for other applications.
Three monoterpenes are on iGEM registry. An addition of our new γ-terpinene to iGEM registry broaden the repertoire. By growing the repertoire, we hope that someday iGEM can reproduce every scent that exists in the nature.
