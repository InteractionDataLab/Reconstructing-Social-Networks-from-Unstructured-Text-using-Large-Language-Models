In order to bring the progress of our project to the public, we created a Twitter account for KIT-Kyoto team. This allows us to connect with other iGEM teams around the world. The knowledge about other teams' projects, their progress and their passion is the greatest motivator for us. It also helps us improve the quality of our projects. This gives opportunities to those who didn't know about iGEM or who is not biology major to be interested in iGEM and in synthetic biology in general.
Media Coverage
September 3, 2014
KTV, a major TV station in Japan, visited BioArt Club at KIT to cover the club's activities. BioArt Club is an alumni group of KIT-Kyoto iGEM team. The current KIT-Kyoto iGEM team members also assisted the shooting. The report covered two of the artworks. One was drawings with GFP expressing E. coli. E. coli was used as an ink, so drawings glow mystically in UV light. The other was accessory making. The club members walked through the campus to collect locust wings, coated them with resin and colored them with nail colors to turn them into funky earrings and the like. These accessories were once on sale. The report about the club was aired on Anchor, an evening news program. The viewership was 12.2%, which is quite high.
At KIT, iGEM doesn't end at Giant Jamboree. It evolves into long running activities and keep disseminating the message about synthetic biology to the broader public.
