Overall project summary
In vivo, proteins are synthesized in transcription and translation.       Generally, mRNA is single-strand RNA and starts translation by binding ribosome on start codon. And then the translation ends by separating ribosome from mRNA.     In this study, we aim to build the method of synthesizing long-chain, massive proteins and to improve translation efficiency.      That is, circular mRNA allows ribosomes to have a semi-permanent translation mechanism and improves a defect of stop codon.     To cyclize mRNA, we can use a splicing mechanism of T4 phage.      Splicing is a mechanism removing circular intron which doesn't code for proteins and joining in exon which codes for ones.      It occurs after transcription.      Splicing is catalyzed by several base sequences of the ends of introns as a ribozyme, being subjected to nucleophilic attack from intron to exon.     So we will introduce the plasmid which places the sequence of the end of intron as a splicing ribozyme on the end of a gene coding for proteins into E. coli, and cyclize mRNA for      synthesis of long-chain, massive proteins.
Introduction
We want to create an unbelievablely long protein. In vivo, the process of protein synthesis is transcription and translation. Generally, mRNA is linear. Translation is started by ribosome binding on a start codon and then it is stopped by dissociation of ribosome from mRNA. The size of synthesized protein is constant. So we planned the construction of circular mRNA without stop codon. It enables infinite translation, so it enables mass production of the protein. This is just like a protein factory!
Project Flow
We can use the group I intron self-splicing mechanism in td gene of T4 phage to circularize mRNA. The group I intron self-splicing is a mechanism that circularizes an intron and connects exons. It occurs after transcription. The self-splicing is catalyzed by several base sequences of the ends of introns as a ribozyme. We permuted exons and introns with the mechanism and attempted an exon circularization. So we constructed mRNA circularization devices. We induced a protein coding sequence and them into E. coli. We created circular mRNA and synthesized massive long-chain protein with it.

Theory & Methods
The circularization mechanism of group I intron
The group I intron is capable of self-splicing. The mRNA circularization device is based on the mechanism. We explain the circularization mechanism of group I intron with td gene of T4 phage as an example. Td gene consists of an upstream exon, an upstream intron, an ORF, a downstream intron and a downstream exon.  As the first step, a nucleophilic attack by a guanosine separates the upstream exon from the upstream intron and then the guanosine bonds to the 5’ end of the upstream intron.  As the second step, the downstream exon is separated from the downstream intron by a nucleophilic attack. The nucleophilic attack takes place by a hydroxy group at the 3’ end of the upstream exon. (Figure 1)
Fig.2 Self-splicing in T4 phage: the first and second step (Blue: intron, Orange: exon)
As the third step, the upstream intron bonds to the downstream intron by an attack on an adenine of the upstream intron. The attack takes place by a hydroxyl group of an end of the downstream intron. And then a circular intron is formed.(Figure 2)

The permuted intron-exon method: PIE method
Two exons are connected with each other in the circularization system; furthermore an exon can theoretically be circularized by the system. (Fig.4)

The method that puts the theory into practice is the PIE method. The PIE method stands for the Permuted Intron-Exon method. A circular mRNA is made by the method.

Pick out the intron and splice site in the exon.
Sandwich the sequence that you want to circularize between preceding fragments.

Experiments
Parts construction
Parts assembly
We picked out the two fragments (5’ side and 3’ side) for self-splicing from td gene of T4 phage. The fragment consists of an intron and the fragment of the exon (splicing site). We integrated a promoter, the fragment of self-splicing (3’ side) and RBS(binding-site for ribosome) into a plasmid. (→ mRNA circularization device (5´ side)) We integrated the fragment of self-splicing (3’ side) and DT (double terminator) into a plasmid. (→ mRNA circularization device (3´ side))(Fig.6)

Detecting circular mRNA
Summary of the experiment
The existence of circular mRNA is confirmed by RNase processing. RNA is decomposed by RNaseA (endoribonuclease). Endogenous RNA (linear RNA)(GAPDH) is decomposed by RNaseR (exoribonuclease), but circular RNA is not decomposed. Double-stranded DNA from undecomposed RNA can be gained with RT-PCR. So the existence of circular mRNA is confirmed by the observation of the DNA with electrophoresis.
