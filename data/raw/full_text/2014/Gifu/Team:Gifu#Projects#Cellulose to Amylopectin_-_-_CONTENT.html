    It is a sheer waste to throw away many cards, so it is great idea that we transform card into MOCHI, tranditional Japanese food made from rice and composed of amylopectin.

We use them to analyze cellulose (it compose new year’s card) and synthesize amylopectin (it is main ingredient of MOCHI). In 2008, the iGEM team of the University of Edinburgh studied reducing cellulose to glucose. We refer to this study and improve it to reduce cellulose. On the other hand we introduce gene coding amylopectin synthetic enzyme from Oryza sativa into E.coli to synthesize amylopectin in body of E.coli. In fact, E.coli have a function to synthesize glycogen from glucose in natural. So we use some parts of this function and remove some of them to realize the efficient transformation.

    Generally, mRNA is single-strand RNA, starting translation by binding ribosome on initiation codon, and ending by separating ribosome from mRNA. 
    In this study, we aim to build the method of synthesizing long-chain, massive proteins and to improve translation efficiency. 
    That is, allowing ribosomes to have a semi-permanent translation mechanism by producing circular mRNA and causing a defect of termination codon.
    To cyclize mRNA, we can use a splicing mechanism of T4 phage. 
    Splicing is a mechanism removing circular introns which don't code for proteins and joining in exons which code for ones. 
    It occurs after transcription. 
    Splicing is catalyzed by several base sequences of the ends of introns as a ribozyme, being subjected to nucleophilic attack from introns to exons.
    So we will introduce the plasmids which place the sequence of the end of introns as a splicing ribozyme on the end of a gene coding for proteins into E.coli, and cyclize mRNA for 
    synthesis of long-chain, massive proteins.
