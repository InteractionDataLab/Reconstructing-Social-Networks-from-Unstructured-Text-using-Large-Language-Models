     Generally, mRNA is single-strand RNA and starts translation by binding ribosome on start codon. And then the translation ends by separating ribosome from mRNA.
    In this study, we aim to build the method of synthesizing long-chain, massive proteins and to improve translation efficiency. 
    That is, circular mRNA allows ribosomes to have a semi-permanent translation mechanism and improves a defect of stop codon.
    To cyclize mRNA, we can use a splicing mechanism of T4 phage. 
    Splicing is a mechanism removing circular intron which doesn't code for proteins and joining in exon which codes for ones. 
    It occurs after transcription. 
    Splicing is catalyzed by several base sequences of the ends of introns as a ribozyme, being subjected to nucleophilic attack from intron to exon.
    So we will introduce the plasmid which places the sequence of the end of intron as a splicing ribozyme on the end of a gene coding for proteins into <I>E. coli</I>, and cyclize mRNA for 
    synthesis of long-chain, massive proteins.</P><H1 class="theme3">Introduction</H1><P>
We want to create an unbelievablely long protein. In vivo, the process of protein synthesis is transcription and translation. Generally, mRNA is linear. Translation is started by ribosome binding on a start codon and then it is stopped by dissociation of ribosome from mRNA. The size of synthesized protein is constant. So we planned the construction of circular mRNA without stop codon. It enables <B>infinite</B> translation, so it enables mass production of the protein. This is just like a protein <B>factory!</B></P><H1 class="theme3">Project Flow</H1><P>
We can use the group I intron self-splicing mechanism in td gene of T4 phage to circularize mRNA. The group I intron self-splicing is a mechanism that circularizes an intron and connects exons. It occurs after transcription. The self-splicing is catalyzed by several base sequences of the ends of introns as a ribozyme. We permuted exons and introns with the mechanism and attempted an exon circularization. So we constructed mRNA circularization devices. We induced a protein coding sequence and them into <I>E. coli</I>. We created circular mRNA and synthesized massive long-chain protein with it.
</P><B> Method of the synthesis of the long chain protein </B><H1 class="theme3">Theory &amp; Methods</H1><H2>The circularization mechanism of group I intron</H2><P>The group I intron is capable of self-splicing. The mRNA circularization device is based on the mechanism. We explain the circularization mechanism of group I intron with td gene of T4 phage as an example. Td gene consists of an upstream exon, an upstream intron, an ORF, a downstream intron and a downstream exon. 
As the first step, a nucleophilic attack by a guanosine separates the upstream exon from the upstream intron and then the guanosine bonds to the 5’ end of the upstream intron. 
As the second step, the downstream exon is separated from the downstream intron by a nucleophilic attack. The nucleophilic attack takes place by a hydroxy group at the 3’ end of the upstream exon. (Figure 1)<B>Fig.2 Self-splicing in T4 phage: the first and second step (Blue: intron, Orange: exon)</B>
As the third step, the upstream intron bonds to the downstream intron by an attack on an adenine of the upstream intron. The attack takes place by a hydroxyl group of an end of the downstream intron. And then a circular intron is formed.(Figure 2)<B>Fig.3 Self-splicing in T4 phage: the third step (Blue: intron, Orange: exon)</B></P><H2>The permuted intron-exon method: PIE method</H2><P>Two exons are connected with each other in the circularization system; furthermore an exon can theoretically be circularized by the system. (Fig.4)<B>Fig.4 An idea of mRNA circularization (Blue: intron, Orange: exon)</B></P><P> The method that puts the theory into practice is the PIE method. The PIE method stands for the Permuted Intron-Exon method. A circular mRNA is made by the method.
