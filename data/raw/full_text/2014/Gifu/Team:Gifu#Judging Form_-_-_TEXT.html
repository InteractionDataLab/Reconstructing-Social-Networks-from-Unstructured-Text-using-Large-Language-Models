Judging Form
This is our Judging Form.
Gold Medal
We have described an approach that our team used to address some questions.  We have discussed safety in two view points; artist and scientist. See our Safety discussion page for more details. About this questions, we have communicated with not only iGEMers or experimenters but also others such as high school students. But not limited to this, we have associated our questions such as heavy metals with application of art. It is important to discuss one problem from various view points. See our Policy&Practice page and Collaboration page.
Silver Medal
We have experimentally validated that one new BioBrick Part and one Device of our own design and construction works as expected. In our experiment, we have testify the differences whether stop codon exist or not. See our project page.
We have documented the characterization of some parts in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry.
And we have submitted them to the iGEM Parts Registry.
→See our Parts page.
We have articulated some questions encountered by our team, and described how our team considered these questions within our project. We discussed the safety with professors, students, and so on (not only our team members).  The purpose is that all who use the same laboratory, including someone who do not know about our experiment such as the design group, the wiki editor and so on, can use laboratories more safely. See our Safety discussion page for more details.
Bronze Medal
We have registered our team, had a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
We have successfully completed and submitted this iGEM 2014 Judging form.
We have created and shared a description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We have prepared to present a poster and talk at the Jamboree.
We have built up the attribution page to clearly attribute the work done by student and others, as seen here .
We have documented some new standard BioBrick Parts or Devices used in our project and submitted these parts to the iGEM Registry.See our Parts page.
