- Université Libre de Bruxelles -
$Welcome$ 'to our Website'
$\Tgo\hspace{-0.145cm}$his year, the Université Libre de Bruxelles competes again in the International Genetically Engineered Machines contest, a competition of synthetic biology organized by the Massachussetts Institute of Technology. Year 2014 will mark the 10th anniversary of the IGEM and will feature a "Giant Jamboree", where all teams will be invited in Boston without regional pre-selection.
Our aim is to enhance recombinant protein production in bioreactors by addicting microorganisms to the production of a protein of interest (PI).  We built $\MyColi$, a recombinant Escherichia Coli expressing a toxin and the PI. This protein will be on the same open reading frame as an antoxin, a protein able to neutralize the effects of the toxin. Stressed subpopulations might not express the PI (and thus the antitoxin) to a sufficient level, allowing the toxin to kill unproductive cells. Our work will consist on building and modelling this system throughout the summer.
