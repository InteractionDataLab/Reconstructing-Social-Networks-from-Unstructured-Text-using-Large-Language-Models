Introduction
The use of Mighty Coli in the society does not raise too many questions: genetically modified microorganisms (GMM) are already used daily (and safely) in the pharmaceutical industry.
However we realized that few people were aware of it, and still mingled GMM with genetically modified crops, which have a terrible reputation in western Europe. Although, Mighty Coli would be welcomed in the industry, we feared that if for some reason we had to ask the authorization of the public to use it, we would only face fear, incomprehension, and eventually refusal. Since the use of synthetic organisms is an important ethical and societal issue, we think that the general public should be included in the debate. But we also think that it should be properly informed about the nature of synthetic organisms and the way they are used. Hence, we decided to organize popularization events on the subject.
Popularization events
After discussion within the team and with our friends and families, we decided that the themes of our popularization events would be synthetic biology, the use of GMMs in research and industry (and the role that Mighty Coli could play in it), and the means and perspectives of genetic manipulations.
We settled on a kind of popularization event that would bring us a maximal visibility, but that would also allow us to interact with each person individually and collect feedback. It would enable us to ensure that our message was not be misunderstood or oversimplified in the popularization process. We found just that opportunity in the Brussels Game festival .
Furthermore, we had the opportunity to participate to the Synbio Hours , a popularization event organised by the iGEM team Uppsala, in Sweden. We thus seized this occasion of explaining our project and of helping the Team Uppsala to explain to students and academics of Uppsala University the perspectives of synthetic biology.
