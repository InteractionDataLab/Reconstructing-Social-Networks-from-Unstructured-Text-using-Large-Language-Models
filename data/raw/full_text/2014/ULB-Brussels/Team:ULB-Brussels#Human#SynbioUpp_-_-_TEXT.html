A Project in Uppsala
The Uppsala iGEM team organizes a yearly popularization event about the iGEM and synthetic biology, to inform academics and student about this new exciting area of biology. Last year it was called Synbio Day, this year it was Synbio Hours.

The trip of Mighty Coli
They kindly invited one of our team members that was currently studying in Uppsala University to give a talk about the Mighty Coli project. Furthermore, it has been agreed that we would rehearse our respective presentations for the Jamboree together and give mutual feedback.  As a result, we gained another vulgarisation event as well as an example of collaboration between two teams.

Tips within Teams
We hope our collaboration will continue until the Giant Jamboree Day & Hours.
