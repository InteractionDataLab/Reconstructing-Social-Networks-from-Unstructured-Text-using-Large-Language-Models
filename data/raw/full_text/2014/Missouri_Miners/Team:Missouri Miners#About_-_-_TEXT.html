About Our Team
We are the Missouri University of Science and Technology iGEM Team. Our team formed in 2007 with just a handful of people working on iGEM projects. Now our team has grown to over 40 members working diligently in the lab and in our campus community. Our team is affiliated with the Student Design and Experiential Learning Center (SDELC), the umbrella organization on campus that includes all of the student design teams.  As our team has grown, we have revamped our new member process with the creation of an online lab training program.  This has already been critical in preparing the influx of new members for work in our laboratory. Another exciting development for our team is that by next year, we will have a brand new lab within the SDELC building.  Plans have been made for this new space and we have moved to design and materials phase.  We are currently working on building our base of corporate partnerships to help ensure the success of this major advancement for our team.
The Missouri S&T iGEM team is proud of our accomplishments as a completely student-managed organization.  It is our goal to use our research to promote hands-on learning in the sciences while contributing valuable information to the scientific community.  If you are interested in learning how to get involved in supporting our team’s mission, visit our website at mstigem.org or email igem@mst.edu .
