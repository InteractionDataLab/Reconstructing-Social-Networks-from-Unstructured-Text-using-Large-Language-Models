My involvement in iGEM has helped me to grow as a leader and as a team member.  Working with the iGEM team at Missouri S&amp;T has provided invaluable lessons that will help me to further advance my career as a scientist.&quot;</P></DIV><H4>Katherine Nelson</H4><DIV id="min"><P style="min-height:180px; overflow: hidden;"><B>Public Relations Officer</B><I>Biological Sciences</I>&quot;I joined iGEM my sophomore year of college hoping to get more involved in lab work on campus. My freshman year I did not do too well in some of my classes and I had not joined many clubs on campus. I had been interested in working in a lab where I could interact with my fellow students and I was interested in many of the ideas from past iGEM projects. I joined to get more hands on experience in labs and to learn more about the field of biology. After joining the public relations committee I became more involved with outreach events and teaching students about synthetic biology. After the first month that I joined I realized that I was much more passionate about teaching and talking then I was about lab work. I am a now a senior in Biological Sciences with a minor in Chemistry and Psychology and the PR officer of iGEM. I could not have asked for a better experience in working with others and putting on outreach events. &quot;</P></DIV><H4>Nocona Sanders</H4><DIV id="min"><P style="min-height:150px; overflow: hidden;"><B>Treasurer</B><I>Physics/Applied Math</I>&quot;I joined iGEM because I've always had an interest in biology. As an incoming freshman, it was a hard decision for me to choose a degree path because I wanted to study so many things. Even though I ended up going with physics and math, I still wanted to fuel my passion for biology. However it wasn't until the end of my freshman year that I heard about iGEM. The team's PR committee put on a program at TJ called &quot;Play With DNA.&quot; It involved extracting DNA from bananas and seeing the chains it created. I had a vague idea of what synthetic biology was before that event, but I understood it a lot more clearly after that discussion. After that program, I started going to iGEM meetings, learning about synthetic biology, and getting involved. That's kept going until today.&quot;</P></DIV><H4>Kelsey Crossen</H4><DIV id="min"><P><B>Secretary</B><I>Biological Sciences</I>&quot;I switched my major to Biological Sciences after my freshman year and I joined iGEM because I thought genetic engineering work sounded really cool. My future goals include going to grad school and having a career doing research, so having lab experience through iGEM was something that I really wanted to get involved in.&quot;</P></DIV><H4>Matthew Lindner</H4><DIV id="min"><P><B>Web Master</B><I>Computer Science</I>&quot;I first heard of iGem through my roommate. He told me about some of the research the team was doing, and I was blown away. I started going to weekly meetings to learn more about their projects. I stuck around because I wanted to learn how a Computer Science student could help a synthetic biology group.&quot;</P></DIV><H4>Kira Buckowing</H4><DIV id="min"><P style="min-height:150px; overflow: hidden;"><B>Lab Manager</B><I>Biochemical Engineering</I>&quot;Basically I joined iGEM because I thought it was interesting and I saw application possibilities for what we do. I have always liked genetics and being able to do something applicable with such made me really want to get involved. I like all the possibilities available and all that teams have been able to do or will be able to do in the future - it is really just amazing to me. I would like for things like what iGEM teams do to become more common place in the future and actually get more implemented than they are now, and I really care about the organization as a whole because of this and want it to be the best thing that it can be - both on our campus and worldwide.&quot;</P></DIV><H4>Edna Armstrong</H4><DIV id="min"><P><B>Safety Liaison</B><I>Biological Sciences</I>idk quote or something work with me guys</P></DIV><H4>Levi Palmer</H4><DIV id="min"><P style="min-height:233px; overflow: hidden;"><B>Former Lab Manager</B><I>Chemical Engineering</I>&quot;In high school biology, we learned about a chemical called Sonic Hedgehog. It's a growth factor that helps stem cells differentiate and become mature cell types (e.g. skin, muscle, blood cells). When I learned that we could control what stem cells became, I was hooked on biology. I continued to feed this fascination over the next few years by reading anything I could get on biology. In a book of scientific articles, I found one on gene therapy, which is replacing &quot;faulty&quot; genes with healthy ones. For me, this was the start of thinking about modifying DNA to fix problems or even to make completely new phenotypes.I went to 5 booths at Minerama, one of them was iGEM. When I looked up 'Synthetic Biology,' I knew it was the field for me. It was a place where, in time, I could actually do DNA modification myself. Plus, the project they were working on sounded really neat; a microbial blood glucose sensor for diabetic patients. I went to the meeting and really felt welcomed by the team, unlike some other teams I visited. So I stuck around, visited the lab, talked to the workers, saw how much they cared about their work, and quickly fell in love with SynBio.&quot;</P></DIV><H3>Communications &amp; Publications Committee</H3><H4>Caitlin Brocker</H4><DIV id="min"><P><I>Chemical Engineering</I></P></DIV><H4>Ricky Fowler</H4><DIV id="min"><P><I>Chemical Engineering</I></P></DIV><H4>Aaron Jankelow</H4><DIV id="min"><P><I>Chemical Engineering</I>&quot;I joined iGEM because I thought it sounded interesting and useful.&quot;</P></DIV><H4>Harriet Lumula</H4><DIV id="min"><P><I>Biological Sciences</I></P></DIV><H4>John Seaton</H4><DIV id="min"><P><I>Chemical Engineering</I>&quot;Junior in chemical engineering at Missouri S&amp;T, born and raised in St. Louis.
