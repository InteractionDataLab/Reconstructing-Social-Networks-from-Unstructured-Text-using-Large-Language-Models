"I joined iGEM my freshman year because it seemed like a good way to learn more about biological research and to get involved with a group of students with similar interests.  My involvement in iGEM has helped me to grow as a leader and as a team member.  Working with the iGEM team at Missouri S&T has provided invaluable lessons that will help me to further advance my career as a scientist."
Katherine Nelson
Public Relations Officer
Biological Sciences
"I joined iGEM my sophomore year of college hoping to get more involved in lab work on campus. My freshman year I did not do too well in some of my classes and I had not joined many clubs on campus. I had been interested in working in a lab where I could interact with my fellow students and I was interested in many of the ideas from past iGEM projects. I joined to get more hands on experience in labs and to learn more about the field of biology. After joining the public relations committee I became more involved with outreach events and teaching students about synthetic biology. After the first month that I joined I realized that I was much more passionate about teaching and talking then I was about lab work. I am a now a senior in Biological Sciences with a minor in Chemistry and Psychology and the PR officer of iGEM. I could not have asked for a better experience in working with others and putting on outreach events. "
Nocona Sanders
Treasurer
Physics/Applied Math
"I joined iGEM because I've always had an interest in biology. As an incoming freshman, it was a hard decision for me to choose a degree path because I wanted to study so many things. Even though I ended up going with physics and math, I still wanted to fuel my passion for biology. However it wasn't until the end of my freshman year that I heard about iGEM. The team's PR committee put on a program at TJ called "Play With DNA." It involved extracting DNA from bananas and seeing the chains it created. I had a vague idea of what synthetic biology was before that event, but I understood it a lot more clearly after that discussion. After that program, I started going to iGEM meetings, learning about synthetic biology, and getting involved. That's kept going until today."
Kelsey Crossen
Secretary
Biological Sciences
"I switched my major to Biological Sciences after my freshman year and I joined iGEM because I thought genetic engineering work sounded really cool. My future goals include going to grad school and having a career doing research, so having lab experience through iGEM was something that I really wanted to get involved in."
Matthew Lindner
Web Master
Computer Science
"I first heard of iGem through my roommate. He told me about some of the research the team was doing, and I was blown away. I started going to weekly meetings to learn more about their projects. I stuck around because I wanted to learn how a Computer Science student could help a synthetic biology group."
Kira Buckowing
Lab Manager
Biochemical Engineering
"Basically I joined iGEM because I thought it was interesting and I saw application possibilities for what we do. I have always liked genetics and being able to do something applicable with such made me really want to get involved. I like all the possibilities available and all that teams have been able to do or will be able to do in the future - it is really just amazing to me. I would like for things like what iGEM teams do to become more common place in the future and actually get more implemented than they are now, and I really care about the organization as a whole because of this and want it to be the best thing that it can be - both on our campus and worldwide."

Levi Palmer
Former Lab Manager
Chemical Engineering
"In high school biology, we learned about a chemical called Sonic Hedgehog. It's a growth factor that helps stem cells differentiate and become mature cell types (e.g. skin, muscle, blood cells). When I learned that we could control what stem cells became, I was hooked on biology. I continued to feed this fascination over the next few years by reading anything I could get on biology. In a book of scientific articles, I found one on gene therapy, which is replacing "faulty" genes with healthy ones. For me, this was the start of thinking about modifying DNA to fix problems or even to make completely new phenotypes.
I went to 5 booths at Minerama, one of them was iGEM. When I looked up 'Synthetic Biology,' I knew it was the field for me. It was a place where, in time, I could actually do DNA modification myself. Plus, the project they were working on sounded really neat; a microbial blood glucose sensor for diabetic patients. I went to the meeting and really felt welcomed by the team, unlike some other teams I visited. So I stuck around, visited the lab, talked to the workers, saw how much they cared about their work, and quickly fell in love with SynBio."

John Seaton
Chemical Engineering
"Junior in chemical engineering at Missouri S&T, born and raised in St. Louis. I joined iGEM because I want to get laboratory experience and to learn more about biology than I currently do in my curriculum. I would like to one day get a graduate degree in biomedical engineering, tissue engineering, biomaterials, etc, something where I can work on the human body in some fashion, such as designing prosthetic limbs. Outside of school I like to play soccer, ski, cook, and lots more. I am a member of the Communications & Publications team."
Stephanie Soendker
Ceramic Engineering
"I joined iGEM because I was interested in the medical applications of synthetic biology. It is a dream of mine to work in health care and develop technologies that increases patient recovery. Synthetic Biology is a very creative way of solving some of medicine's greatest challenges. That is why I joined the team."
