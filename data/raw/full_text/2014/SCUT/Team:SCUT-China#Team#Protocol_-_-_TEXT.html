Protocol
CaCl2 competent cell
Materials
LB medium,Spectrophotometer,Shaking incubator at 37℃,Ice-cold CaCl2,15% glycerol,Icebox,-80℃ refrigerator
Protocol
Inoculate 5ml LB with E.coli; incubate over night at 37℃ and 250 rpm.
Inoculate 100ml LB with an aliquot of an overnight culture and grow to an O.D.600 of 0.3-0.4 at 37℃ with 250 rpm.
Divide the cultures into two 50ml Epppendorf tubes.
Keep on ice for 30min.
Centrifuged at 4000rpm for 4min at 4℃.
Discard supernatant.
Resuspended in 10ml ice-cold CaCl2.
Keeping on ice for 10min.
Centrifuged at 4000rpm for 4min at 4 ℃ again.
Discard supernatant.
Resuspended in 10ml ice-cold CaCl2.
Keeping on ice for 10min.
Repeat the step 5-8 again.
Centrifuged at 4000rpm for 4min at 4 ℃.
Discard supernatant.
Resuspended in 2ml CaCl2 containing 15% glycerol.
Devide it into 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes, 100ul per tube.
Stored at -80℃.
Heat-shock transformation
Materials
Plasmid or DNA ligation mix,Water bath 42℃,LB medium,Shaking incubator at 37℃,Eppendorf centrifugation,Selective plate
Protocol
Add 1-2ul plasmid to 100ul competent cells. Homogenize by gently mixing with pipette several times. (Note that if the plasmid is product of linkage, add 10-20ul DNA)
Keep on ice for 30min.
