Gold
Policy & practices
Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team's scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM).
1.Thoughtful approach
We popularized synthetic biology combined with our project. We made antimicrobial resistance the theme of our policy & practices to let more people know about the safety of the synthetic biology.
2.Creative approach
We built our own assemble to evaluate our policy & practices on the internet with a biological media
We sent mass emails to life science community to popularize the safety and application in antimicrobial resistance of synthetic biology, and we got the percentages of people who successfully know about our propaganda by telephone visit.
Silver
1.We have designed, built and characterised several new functional Biobricks including:
BBa_K1371000 : encodes deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS1) that synthesizes triketide lactone 1B
BBa_K1371041 : an optimized DEBS1 with RFP
BBa_K1371015 : ensure the supply of various propionyl-CoA
2.We completed and submitted our safety documentation and published general safety information on our wiki safety page
Policy & practices
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights.
1.We set our own assemble to provide synthetic biology information for the general public with a exhibition.
2.Our team communicated with an array of individuals and organizations that are critical of synthetic biology
3.We completed and submitted our safety documentation and published general lab safety information on our wiki safety page
Bronze
1.We have registered our team , had a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Regional Jamboree.
2.We have set up a team wiki .
3.Create and share a description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
4.We have completed the judging form.
5.We have a poster and presentation, which we will be presenting at the Jamboree.
6.The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others.
7.We have designed, built and characterised several new functional Biobricks and submitted characterisation data to the parts registry see list above.
