SCUT
South China University of Technology (SCUT) is one of China's key universities operating under the direct leadership of the State Ministry of Education. The university, which has a total area of 294 hectares, is situated in Guangzhou, a southern metropolitan in China. The university has two campuses: The Wushan Campus and Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center Campus.
South China University of Technology (SCUT), formerly known as the South China Institute of Technology, was established in 1952. In 1960, SCUT was awarded ranked among the key universities of China. In 1981, it was authorized by the State Council to confer doctor degrees and master degrees, and was among the first universities in the country to do so. In 1995, it was selected as one of the universities into which China will make significant investment in the 21st century. In 1999, it wasrated "excellent" during the Undergraduate Teaching Assessment, and was among the first "Excellent Universities of Undergraduate Education" in the country. In the same year, a national science park was established with the authorization of State Ministry of Technology and State Ministry of Education. In 2000, Graduate School was authorized to be established. In 2001, the new cooperative construction of State Ministry of Education and Guangdong Province was implemented in SCUTand it was listed among the top universities in the country. After 60 years of development, SCUT has become a multidisciplinary university focusing on engineering, combined with science, also promoting well coordinated development of management, economics,humanities and law.
School of Bioscience and Bioengineering
School of Bioscience and Bioengineering was founded in 2004, located in the scenic south campus of South China University of Technology (SCUT)，covering 10000 square meters. The School owns individual teaching, laboratory building and complete facilities, which create a good environment and development space for discipline construction.

The School owns individual teaching, laboratory building and complete facilities, which create a good environment and development space for discipline construction.
In 2007, a first class discipline The Light Industry Technology and Engineering was formed by our school’s Fermentation along with Sugar Engineering as well as Pulp and Paper Engineering which became a national-level key discipline. In 4th 2010, it gained the authority to launch PhD program of first class discipline. According to the discipline background and the need of further development, we will focus on 4 second-class disciplines: Microbiology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Physiology and Biophysics as well as Medical Biology. In addition, our school has Post-doctoral mobile station for The Light Industry Technology and Engineering.
Now we concentrate on the researches of Bioinformatics and Microbial Functional Genomics, Microbial Resources and Regulation of Microbial Metabolism, Molecular Transformation and Enzyme Engineering, Fermentation Engineering and Fermentation Equipment, Bio-catalytic Processing Engineering, Bioinformatics, Biomechanics, Medical Information and Equipment, and Biomedicine etc.Since BGI (Beijing Genomics Institute) and our school co-founded a “genomics science” innovation class for two years, there have been a total of 31 co-first authors or byliners publishing 22 high-level papers in top international academic journals "Nature" and "Science".
Our school actively engages in foreign exchange. We successively established close cooperation with a number of British and American well-known colleges such as Oxford, United Kingdom Imperial College, State University of New Jersey, Camegie Meilun and we also establishes strategic alliance with famous domestic universities and academic institutes. Besides, we hired 2006 Physiology or Medicine Nobel Prize winner, chair professor of University of Massachusetts medical school department of Molecular Medicine, Professor Craig Mello as our honorary professor.
