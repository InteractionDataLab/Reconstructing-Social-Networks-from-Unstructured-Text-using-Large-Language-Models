BRONZE
1.Register the team, SCUT-igemers have spent a great summer, we share our joy and pain, give away our energy and sway our sweat, what we get is an unforgettable experience and precious friendship.

3.We have made our own wiki about our project, which records everything we have done this summer, and our wiki is much more attractive than previous igem team.
4.We have made our posters and are going to present a presentation on our project at the iGEM Jamboree in November.
5.We have detailed the division of experiment clearly on our wiki, and most of work is done by students under the guidance of teamleaders and instructos. Besides, this year we have more sponsors than last year.
6.More than 10 parts have been submitted by the official: BBa_K1462090 ,   BBa_K1462110 ,   BBa_K1462120 ,   BBa_K1462130 , et al, and the parts we submit perform function properly.

GOLD
1.This year，we have worked hard to IMPROVE characterization and ADDED a lot useful information for existing Biobrick. We have tested TEF2 ( BBa_K1462430 )and TDH3( BBa_K1462440 ), quantified Galactose Dose titer to test the induction intensity of GAL1 promter( BBa_J63006 , BBa_K1462450 ) and completed decription of a lot existing biobrick ( BBa_K900003 , BBa_K900002 , BBa_K900005 , BBa_K1462430 , BBa_K1462440 , BBa_J63006 )
2.This year, the SCUT 2014 iGEM team have made great efforts to let common people know about Synthetic Biology, including opening serveral lectures for high school students, undergraduates, and professors, traveling to Hongkong, Wuhan, Shenzhen and Guangzhou to communicate and discuss synthetic biology with many other iGEM teams and conducting a questionnaire survey to gather the information of public awareness and approving degree of Synthetic BiologyAdditionally, we issued our original magazines to introduce the knowledge of Synthetic Biology and iGEM, the aim of our project, the prospect of our iGEM life etc..
