Campus Activity
Throughout this year, we worked hard to popularize the concept of synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance on campus. As college students, campus is our most familiar and influential place. We organized a series of campus activities, both on college campus and on high school campus, with the hope to recruit freshmen or high school students who are interested in science and would like to devote themselves to our projects. After all, the development of synthetic biology should start from students.
In December 2013, we held an activity named “Early birds in the Laboratory” for the freshmen of our college. Basic experimental skills of molecular biology and the concept of synthetic biology were taught.
In June 2014, on the opening day of our university, we set up a tent on campus to answer questions about the synthetic biology and iGEM for high school students.
In June 2014, we arrived at Chaozhou district for a three-day propaganda in the local high schools. We visited 4 high schools, had our tents there to popularize synthetic biology, and gave presentations to deliver knowledge. Meanwhile, our brochures about synthetic biology reached more than 2,000 students.
We organized and participated in the "2014 National High Educated Teenager Scientific Camp of south china university of technology" during which we gave a lecture about the advanced synthetic biology to combat the Antimicrobial Resistance and iGEM to all of the teenagers joined this activity.
"The 2014 National High Educated Teenager Scientific Camp-sub-camp of South China University of Technology" was successfully held at SCUT. 200 senior students from Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Yunnan took part in this educational activity. This activity was directed by the theme "Fly to SCUT, Fly to your dream". During this very week, students learned about the culture and spirit of SCUT, the celebrity of top faculty and the charm of science. All these variable and interesting scientific events did leave unforgettable memory to all the participating students.
There was a presentation about how to use biology to solve the bacterial drug resistance and the 10th iGEM anniversary celebration. Many students were inspired, developed interests in biology, and ask us biological questions in their mind with curiosity.
