Two years ago, a senior, Last year, a freshman of graduate and now he is a Second Grade student of graduate, majoring biochemistry and molecular biology. It’s the third year to attend iGEM, from the team member to captain and establish the first iGEM team of SCUT. This year, His role in team is charging in project design and there have severe interesting the technology support and the team routine, including giving new technology presentation, organizing weekly SCUT-IGEM meeting and keeping track of what everybody is doing, etc. Particularly worth mentioning is that besides this “The Forgotten Corner”, there have several interesting project in our brainstorm, pathogenic entero-becteria inhibitor system and Mess production of antimicrobial peptide through fimbria.
He loves life, loves science and would like to challenge himself such as long-distance running and climbing.
“iGEM is excellent team and I’m so glad to go along with them on this summer; iGEM is not only a competition, but you can get precious friendship for forever”.
