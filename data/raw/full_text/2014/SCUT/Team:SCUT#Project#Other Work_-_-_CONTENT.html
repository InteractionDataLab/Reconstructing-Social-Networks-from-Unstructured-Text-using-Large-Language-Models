This is an additional part of our project, designed to testing and quantify promoter activities for having moderate expression level of target protein, or more detailedly saying, for knowing if TEF2 and TDH3 promoter work and for better control of induction of Gal1 promoter, the only inducible promoter used in our project. We employed GFPmut3b ( BBa_K294055 ), one of the most widely used fluorescence protein, as a reporter. After making a comparison between FCM and ELIASA, we chose the latter one for quantification of fluorescence since it was more convenient to manipulate and was accurate enough for comparing promoter activities. Considering that the fermentation process will span a period of time from several hours to several days, we did not have timed induction of Gal1 promoter included in quantification process.  
</P><P><SPAN class="xiaobiaoti">Design and Result</SPAN>
With employing GFPmut3b (<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K294055:Design">BBa_K294055</A>) as a reporter protein, we designed three similar devices only differing in promoters as shown below.</P><P><B>Promoter Testing</B>
Plasmids carrying the above-mentioned devices were transformed into competent S.cerevisiae cells. Transformed cells were plated on 2% agar in media A (yeast nitrogen base, MET, LYS, HIS, URA), complemented with 2% glucose and cultured at 30℃ for 48h. The colonies were then inoculated in the liquid media A complemented with 2% glucose and were grown at 30℃ overnight. For those contained TEF2  or TDH3 promoter, culture was stopped and samples were taken out for testing. For those contained Gal1 promoter, glucose was removed from media with washing cells by PBS till they reached the exponential phase. Cells were then pelleted and diluted and cultured on liquid medium containing galactose concentration of 2% w/v overnight. Samples were then taken out for testing. The result is shown below.</P><P class="m-zhujie"><B>Figure 1 丨 The results show that all the promoters work.</B></P><P><B>Galactose Dose Response of Gal1 Promoter</B>
Plasmid carrying the device containing Gal1 promoter was transformed into competent S.cerevisiae cells. Transformed cells were plated on 2% agar in media A (yeast nitrogen base, MET, LYS, HIS, URA), complemented with 2% glucose and cultured at 30℃ for 48h. The colonies were then inoculated in the liquid media A complemented with 2% glucose and were grown at 30℃. Culture was stopped and glucose was removed from media with washing cells by PBS till they reached the exponential phase. Cells were then pelleted and diluted and cultured on liquid medium containing galactose concentrations between 0.25% and 2% w/v overnight. Samples were taken out for quantification.
</P><P>
In quantification process, concentrations of liquid media containing cells were measured at λ600nm and then liquid media were removed and cells were washed twice and refolded to a OD600 = 1.0 concentration by Buffer ( 0.05 M NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 M Imidazole ) for ELIASA analysis. Fluorescence intensity of the refolded cells were then measured by ELIASA (Tecan, Infinite M200 and i-Control)) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm (the suggested one is 501 nm), and an emission filter of 520 nm (the suggested one is 511nm) to quantify fluorescence intensities. The result is shown below.
</P><P class="zhujie"><B>Figure 2 丨 Dose responsiveness of the Gal1 promoter to galactose induction</B></P><P>
The graph above summarises the ELIASA data, and shows that the intensity of GFP expressing cells induced by low or high dose of galactose are higher then those induced by the middle doses. This is similar to the result given by iGEM 2010 team, Aberdeen_Scotland. We therefore plan to set more experiment groups between these doses to figure out what happened.</P></DIV><DIV class="mainbody " id="label_2"><P class="atop"><SPAN>Leading Peptides for Future Plan</SPAN></P><P>What we plan to do next is to find the other pathways in the yeast and make it highly effective by taking advantages of the micro environments. But frist of all, how to make the protein import into its own station and work smoothly?  Fortunately, we find some leading peptides to be our “guides”. As we know, different locations need different “guides”. This summer, we have constructed 6 leading peptides successfully in the yeast. In other words, we have 6 another possibility to take advantages of the micro environments.We chose those 8 membrane from a list of about ten candidates based on the following factor:1.It can be easily targeted in yeast.2.Less reaction over it is not allowed.3.Visible distinction from others.So far，we have found the following leading peptides.
</P><P><SPAN>
1.Erv25p
</SPAN>
We characterized a novel protein termed Erv25p that have benn discovered on ER-derived transport vesicles, and it is required for efficient ER to golgi transport. Erv25p is a single membrane spanning segment derived from yeast, and a 12-amino acid N-terminal sequence exposed to the cytoplasm.</P><P class="zhujie">

6.PTS
There is a mechanism about cargo translocation in the peroxisomes, the matrix proteins are posttranslationally targeted to peroxisomes from the cytosol by peroxisomal targeting signals (PTSs). These signals include the predominantly used PTS1(<A href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1462910">BBa_K1462910</A>) and the less prevalent PTS2, which are recognized by the soluble import receptors PEX5 and PEX7, respectively.
 We obtained this nine-bp-leading peptide by gene synthesis .GFP  was fused to its C-terminus as reporter. The biobrick is constructed as follow to verify this leading peptide.</P></DIV><DIV class="mainbody" id="label_5"><P class="atop"><SPAN>References</SPAN></P><P>[1]   Michael J.
