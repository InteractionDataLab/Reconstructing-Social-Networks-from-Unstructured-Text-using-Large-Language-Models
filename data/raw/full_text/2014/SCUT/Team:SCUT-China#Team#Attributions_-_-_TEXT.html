Xihao Liao
He is primarily responsible for laboratory and team management. At the same time, He organizes and coordinates the whole team work, provides strategies for solving the problem, and also contributes in some parts of the project.
Yanhui Liang
During the experiment process, the little girl completed the molecular of pSB1C3 (L9-TE+2T) and pSB4A5 (pT7-RBS+birA-RBS+AccA2) and PCR amplification of DEBS (the result is failed →＿→). In addition, she is responsible for Volunteer Training of The First Session of Synthetic Biology & iGEM popularization Guangdong Science Center Pavilion Volunteer Training Manual and making the survey How Much Do You Know about Antibacterial Resistance.
Yuxin Chen
A positive guy of our team members belongs to the experiment group. In the preparamental 
phase,he takes part in the design of our project. Then, he is in charge of yielding BAP1 by gene knock-out
 in the experimental phase.
Shanshan Qu
In the team, she took part in the establishment of docking domains assisting others and wrote the wiki for docking domain. The building of birA in our experiment was also her attempt. She was also responsible for some propaganda work.
Qifeng Tan
He is in charge of the construction of docking domain and chassis in the early stage. Later in charge of the product expression and detection.
Qitong Weng
In the project, he's responsible for the design of the exchanging of loading module and basic exchanging of domains in PKS. Then he constructed the part of KS-AT2-KR2-ACP2-TE.He also designed the protocol of the expression of DEBS1+TE. He wrote the part of wiki for overview and background.
Yiran Wu
She is a member of the experimental team. She participates in designing the project. She is responsible for standardizing of the genes encoding domain of DEBS and assembling them in correct order. Also, she takes parts in the expression of DEBS1+TE and the detection of product triketide lactone.
Yaqin Du
She is also a former member of the iGEM team of 2013. Thus, we always benefit from her experiences, especially about gene knockout. Additionally, she is ambitious and gives constructive suggestions.
Xuan Li,Zhangyan Ling,Xiuyuan Wang,Xueman Pan
They are designer in our team; they was responsible for design of LOGO, PPT template,poster, Wiki and team uniform. We are so appreciate what they have done for SCUT iGEM team.
Qian Zhao
During the year, she is just like a butler of our team who manage all the funds, also charge of the purchases for experiments. In addition, she helped completing the Police & Practices part of our team, which includes the performance and writing of wiki.
Yiding Chen
I am mainly responsible for the Human Practice. I obtained the sponsorship of five companies for our team. And I organized several promotional activities of Synthetic biology and iGEM. I am the persons-in-charge of the activity in Guangdong Science Center. And I committed to the network media, too.
The highlight of modeling section is:
(1)Simulating the kinetic equations of each domain.
(2)Establish kinetic model by stacking the equations of the related domains.
(3)Establish kinetic model of DEBS 1 + TE, and then compare it with superposition type of equations.
Junying Su
He analyzes the mechanism of catalyzed reactions of every domain, and he apply the kinetic equations of the related mechanism to each domain. Then he simplify these equations. and Li zhiwei simulate the simplified kinetic model.
Yizhao Xiao
He devotes to search for all kinetic constants, including catalytic constants, Michaelis constants, dissociation constants and so on. According to the specific circumstance provided by articles, he select the most suitable values and apply them to our project.
Cheng Li
Cheng Li who is a Ph.D taught us how to use Real Time PCR and gave us useful advice on our project.
Yuanyuan Huang
She is also a Ph.D who provided some technical guidance on operating BL21(DE3).
Ying Lin
Prof. Dr. Ying Lin,she mainly provides laboratory equipments and expenditure for our project.
Li Pan
Prof. Dr. Li Pan,he shared his experiments to guide us how to make our project more suitable to the requirements of the competition.
Yanrui Ye
His major role in the team is to help with laboratory techniques.
