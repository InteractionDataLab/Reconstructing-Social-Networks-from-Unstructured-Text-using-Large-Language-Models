Synthetic Biology for Realer Living
This year, the SCUT 2014 iGEM team has focused on the topic---"Synthetic Biology for Realer Living". We have made great efforts to let common people know that Synthetic Biology is around us and can help to simplify and optimize our life. We can use it for better life.
Firstly, we made several reports for high school students, undergraduates, and professors about health and medicine, new energy, green production, and pollution control. Secondly, we issued our original magazines to introduce the knowledge of Synthetic Biology and iGEM, the aim of our project, the prospect of our iGEM life etc. Thirdly, we went to Hongkong, Wuhan, Shenzhen and Guangzhou to communicate and discuss with many other iGEM teams. Lastly, we conducted a questionnaire survey to gather the information of public awareness and approving degree of Synthetic Biology and iGEM. In addition, we have received almost one thousand valid questionnaires and completed the data analyses.

Looking forward to more wonderful items, please click on the page .
This is an electronic magazine with a collection of ten well-chosen original articles. During the past summer holiday, we teamed up with the Science Department of our university to successfully launch the original magazine "iGEM" by means of the cooperation between the network platform of the Students' Innovation Club and RenRen professional networking service platform.
