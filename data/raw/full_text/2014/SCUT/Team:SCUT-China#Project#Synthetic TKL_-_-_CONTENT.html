domains can be standardized and reconstructed to generate chimeric 

polyketide synthases that produce new-to-nature polyketides, through 

which we can dramatically expand the library of antibiotic candidates. 

In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we conducted 

“proof of concept” experiments to synthesize a simple polyketide—

triketide lactone 1B—using a truncated erythromycin-producing 

polyketide synthase assembled with biobricks constructed by 

standardizing essential domains required for the synthesis of the 

triketide lactone. The domains we standardized are the loading domain, 

domains of DEBS1 and the thioesterase (TE) domain from DEBS3 (Fig. 1). 

The loading domain is required for the direct loading of propionyl-CoA 

to form a starter unit for triketide lactone. DEBS1 is a large 

multifunctional polypeptide composed of two modules that incorporate 

(2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA to form extender units. The TE domain catalyzes 

the intramolecular cyclization of the triketide to form the target 

triketide lactone. <SUP>[1]</SUP>The target product is expected to be detected 

and identified from the culture broth.</P><P class="title" id="label2">Design</P><P class="bold">Candidate selection</P><P>
Biosynthesis of polyketides like erythromycin, tacrolimus and many 

others are guided by modular PKS genes. These genes encode large 

enzymes consisting of modules of domains, forming an &quot;assembly line&quot; 

to extend the ketide units to form polyketides. Among the known PKS 

genes, the genes coding for erythromycin producing polyketide 

synthethase have been extensively and deeply studied, and there are 

numerous information sources. Therefore, we chose a truncated 

erythromycin-producing polyketide synthase which has been proved to 

produce a simple triketide lactone 1B.<SUP>[2]</SUP></P><P class="title">Standardization of domains</P><P class="bold">Figuring Out the Boundary</P><P>
With the idea of engineering PKS genes to be interchangeable domains, 

we firstly develop certain design principles for the engineering of 

PKS genes. Although many PKSs are highly modular proteins consisting 

of modules of domains, figuring out the boundary of each domain should 

be carefully considered because slight changes may result in lost of 

function.To achieve this goal, we searched for more information from two 

database ASMPKS (Analysis System for Modular Polyketide Synthases:(<A href="http://gate.smallsoft.co.kr:8008/~hstae/asmpks/pks_prediction.pl">http://gate.smallsoft.co.kr:8008/~hstae/asmpks/pks_prediction.pl</A> ) and MAPSI (Management and Analysis for Polyketide Synthase type I: (<A href="http://gate.smallsoft.co.kr:8008/pks/">http://gate.smallsoft.co.kr:8008/pks/</A> ). According to the resource 

provided by these websites, we separated the sequences of DEBS1 with 

centering on domains.
</P><P class="three">Standardization of Interchangeable Domains</P><P>
Once the boundaries of the domains have been defined, standard prefix 

or suffix should be assigned to each end of the domains to make them 

interchangeable. The standardization of sufficient numbers of domains 

from numerous organisms would allow customized replacement, 

rearrangement, and/or recombining of different domains to produce 

novel polyketides. In this project, we tested customized synthesis of 

triketide lactones by replacing the loading domain and swapping KR+ACP 

domains between modules to test the compatibility of the standardized 

domains.
</P><P class="bold">The “proof-of-concept” product--triketide lactone 1B</P><P class="three">Assemble standardized domains</P><P>
To validate our proposal we attempted to express the varient --

DEBS1+TE in <I>E.coli</I>. <SUP>[3]</SUP> Initially, we tried to amplify the coding 

sequences for each individual domain from <I>Saccharopolyspora erythraea </I>

genomic DNA by PCR using primers consisting of RFC 23. However, after 

laborious work of weeks, we had failed to obtain proper PCR products 

due to the high G+C content (≥70%) of the interest DNA sequences. 

Afterward, to achieve our goal in a more efficient way, we contracted 

GENEWIZ, an international genomics service company, to synthesize the 

genes. With the coding genes under the control of T7 promoter and 

double T7 terminator, we successfully assembled three constructs for 

our design.

We were able to assemble all of our constructs and continued our work 

with our synthetic DEBS1+TE, DEBS1’+TE (KR of module2 in DEBS1 was 

replaced with KR of module1) and RFP+DEBS1+TE (DEBS1 was fused with 

red fluorescent protein) by transforming them into the <I>E. coli</I> strain 

BAP1. (Fig. 2)
</P><P>   
If the right product triketide lactone can be generated, we can 

conclude that the standardized domains can work relatively 

independently and generate normal product.
</P><P>
Also, we changed the loading domains which selected different 

substrates resulting in product of different polyketides.
</P><P>
Furthermore, we can shuffle the domains as units between different 

DEBSs.
</P><P class="bold">Induction of PKSs </P><P>
12-48 hours after induction with IPTG, culture broth samples of the 

recombinant strain expressing the chimeric polyketide synthetases were 

collected and subjected for further analysis.
</P><P class="title">Results </P><P class="bold">1. DNA Electrophoresis </P><P>
We used restriction enzyme digestion and/or PCR to validate the 

constructs (Fig. 3). The constructs carrying DEBS1+TE and DEBS1’+TE 

were isolated and digested with <I>EcoRI</I> (Fig. 3, lane 1 and 2) or double 

digested with <I>EcoRI</I>+<I>PstI</I> (data not shown). The construct carrying RFP

+DEBS1+TE was validated with PCR (Fig. 3 lane 3) and <I>EcoRI</I>+<I>PstI</I> double 

digestion (data not shown). The results showed that all of the three  

constructs were successfully created.
</P><P class="bold">2. SDS-PAGE</P><P>

DEBS1 is a large protein of 370kDa. We performed SDS-PAGE to confirm 

the expression of the recombiant DEBS1+TE and DEBS1’+TE. However, 

none of DEBS1+TE, DEBS1’+TE (data not shown) and RFP+DEBS1+TE (Fig. 

4) could be detected after Coomassie blue staining. 
</P><P class="bold">3.RT-PCR validation on transcriptional level</P><P>
After failure of detecting target proteins using SDS-PAGE, we used 

RT-PCR to examine the expression of the target genes on 

transcriptional level. The results were shown in Fig. 5. We used 16S 

rRNA gene as an house keeping gene to compare the expression level of 

target genes. The results showed that DEBS1 gene was successfully 

expressed, albeit the transcription level was relatively low compared 

with other target genes (<I>acc, pcc</I> and <I>sfp</I>) whose transcription are 

controlled by T7 promoter as well. The low transcription level of 

DEBS1 gene is in consistent with our SDS-PAGE results. This result 

might due to the large size of DEBS1, which could hamper both the 

transcriptional and translational efficiency.
</P><P class="bold">4.Fluorescence detection analyses</P><P>
To further confirm the expression of DEBS1, we monitored the 

fluorescence of RFP under Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope (Fig. 6). 

The results showed that after excitation with lazer source, red 

fluorescence was monitored in the RFP+DEBS1+TE transformant, while in 

the BL21 strain, no fluorescence was detected. These results indicate 

that RFP+DEBS1+TE was successfully expressed in the transformant.
</P><DIV class="center"><P>

</P></DIV><P class="bold">5.UPLC-MS/MS Detection of TKL 1B</P><P>
To test if RFP+DEBS1+TE was functionally expressed, the transformant 

was grown in Luria Broth (LB) liquid medium and induced with IPTG. 

After 48h of induction, cells were harvested and the supernatant was 

used for the extraction of the product TKL1B. After extraction, the 

samples were concentrated by 5 times and subjected into a triple 

quadrupole mass spectrometry and monitored under an MRM mode using the 

parent ion /product ion=173.1/155.1 channel. The results were shown in 

Fig. 7. The retention time of the target product in the UPLC column 

was 6.42 min, using water/methanol gradient elution protocol. We 

monitored a strong response at m/z = 155.1 ion pair in the RFP

+DEBS1+TE transformant sample. The ion pair of 173.1/155.1 is specific 

to the expected product TKL1B, and is in consistent with previous 

studies. These results demonstrated that TKL1B was successfully 

produced from the transformant.<SUP>[4]</SUP></P><P class="title">Conclusion</P><P>
In this project, we realized the design by standardizing domains from 

the gene cluster of DEBSs. To our knowledge, it was the first time to 

assemble domains as individual units.
</P><P>
We performed separations of the coding sequence resulted in 

standardized domains and assembled these domains in correct order for 

generating our target product triketide lactone.<SUP>[5]</SUP> Evaluation of 

recombinant DEBS+TE expression was performed by RT-PCR analyses, 

fluorescence microscopy analyses, SDS-PAGE and final polyketide 

product was detected using Mass Spectrometry. Our results demonstrated 

that standardized domains could express correctly folded and 

posttranslationally modified modular PKSs, we concluded that domains 

in PKSs can work relatively independently. Furthermore, RFP may 

influence the function of protein, but in our project the product 

could be generated via BAP1 harboring plasmids with RFP-DEBS1-TE. 

Also, there is one scar (Thr-Arg) every two parts produced in every 

ligations because of RFC 23 .We had worried these additional amino 

acids may affect the expression of our synthetase. However, the 

complete construction with 20 additional amino acids of RFP-DEBS1-TE, 

expressed well from the IPTG-inducible promoter present in pSB1C3 in 

E. coli strain BAP1. According to these results, we demonstrated the 

compatibility as well as interchangeability between different 

standardized domains. <SUP>[6]</SUP></P><P>
Based on investigation of standardized domains coming from semi-

rational separation, the obtained results represented an important 

milestone toward the ultimate goal of creating novel PKSs by 

assembling standardized domains.Additionally, these results showed 

a new approach to generating triketide lactone, which can be an 

important source of advanced intermediates of complex polyketides.<SUP>[7]</SUP></P><P class="title">References</P><P class="little">
