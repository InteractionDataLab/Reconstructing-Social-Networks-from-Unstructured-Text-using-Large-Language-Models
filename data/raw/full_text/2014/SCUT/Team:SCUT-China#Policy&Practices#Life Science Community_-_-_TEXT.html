Life Science Community
What we have been doing so far is focused on promoting Synthetic Biology and iGEM to general public, in order to provoke thinking and debating of food safety, production sustainability and microorganism drug resistance issues. However, the general public are not the ones who own the knowledge of skills to turn Synthetic Biology into real products. Those who do are gathered in research labs of universities and companies. And they should be our target audience. We hope our efforts can stimulate these researchers' interest in Synthetic Biology, motivating more research work. This is the way we can make Synthetic Biology to change the world.
Enterprise Outreach
During this past summer, we had in-depth discussion with 10 companies. After shown to our drug resistance research work, they grew great interest in related fields. At last, four companies, namely Genewiz, Dongsheng Biotech, TransGen Biotech and Generay Biotechnology became collaborators or sponsors of our project.
The following is some products supported by our sponsors. Genewiz also provided very lower discount for our gene synthesis of polykitide synthase domains and gave funding on our team uniform and brochure.

Mass-E-mail
Through biologists social network Biosns. With the speed of sending an email every 30 second in 24 hours one day, we planted to present our work to 500,000 users of other biological internet platforms . When you read this, our mass E-mail system is still sending E-mail non-stop to those users ,  most of  whom are biology professionals. We hope to involve as many people as possible to make them aware of innovative applications of  Synthetic Biology on drug resistance. Meanwhile, we invited them pay attention on the 2014 iGEM Synthetic Biology Competition and the 10th iGEM anniversary celebration. After the mails were successfully sent, we will extract a few recipients to do telephone return visiting, in order to have the statistics of the life science community who learned the synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance trough our mails. Based on the feedback, we concluded and analyzed the effect, and also consulted whether they have some suggesting about antimicrobial resistance or not.
The following is the detail about sending such great amount of e-mail.

Mail content：（source text is Chinese-English bilingual，deleting Chinese here） To Combat the Antimicrobial resistanceSCUT-China iGEM Team Dear Sir or Madam,  This is iGEM group of SCUT-China. We feel very sorry to send this email to you without your permission. And we are grateful for your carrying on reading. We are sincerely looking forward to your attention and interest in Synthetic Biology and the tenth anniversary celebration of iGEM.
About IGEM
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM)is the premiere undergraduate Synthetic Biology competition.
About The Celebration of iGEM’s 10-Year Anniversary
With over 2,500 Synthetic Biology researchers from 245 universities across 32 countries in attendance, the Giant Jamboree is sure to be the largest gathering of synthetic biologists to date.
For more information, please check: https://2014.igem.org/Giant_Jamboree .
SCUT-China: What are we doing this year?
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change in ways that render the medications used to cure the infections they cause ineffective.
In order to deal with this situation, the applications of Synthetic Biology are used. We established a programmed antibiotic synthesis system, which can produce new antibiotics for meeting human’s needs to solve the problem of antimicrobial resistance.
Now, We are holding an exhibition at the Guangdong Science Center. The topic of this exhibition is “Toward the Synthetic Biology, Toward a better life”. This exhibition will last for one month, and is free of charge.
Exhibition Address: Guangdong Science Center
This exhibition is planned and organized by SCUT-China.
