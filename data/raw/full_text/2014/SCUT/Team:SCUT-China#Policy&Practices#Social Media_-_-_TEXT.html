Social Media
When we popularize the safety of synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance, we recognized it not enough to hold activities only, so we focus more on the social media like writing reports on internet. At the beginning, we connected with the school journal. And then as the scale became lager, many famous media came to report us like Guangzhou Daily. Especially the reports about our exhibition in science center, was spread on many well known websites like Tencent, Baidu, Sina and so on.
Our holistic propaganda was promoted by professional media, mass media and social media. Via professional media, led by Biodiscover, Antpedia and Biosns, our promotion has reached a great number of professional groups of over 5 million people. Meanwhile, we also required our sponsors that the propaganda would be promoted to all of their customers, ensuring professional groups are included. Moreover, we promoted our project to ordinary people by mass media led by Tencent, which is the biggest news portal of Chinese internet. As statistics from Iresearch shows, up to October 2013, Chinese user coverage of Tencent had reached 89.73%. As for social media, people get access to our holistic by Wechat（with over 650 million users）and Sina microblog（with about 143.8 million monthly active users）. Our news about exhibition was delivered by many 公众号 and retweeted by official Micro-blogs of many enterprise, including a listed company named Guangdong Teamtop Information Technology Co., Ltd.
Here are screenshots and links of the news as follows.
The following media all have completely reported this activity. Only with their help can iGEM, synthetic biology and how we respond to bacterial drug resistance with synthetic biology be showed to public. We express our sincere thanks tothese media for their contribution to popularize synthetic biology.
Tencent user number
QQ: Although since 2012, when the user number of Tencent reached 1 billion, Tencent has never publish their user number again, QQ number has reached 2044430031 up to Nov 21, 2013, which is started from 10000, according to a statistical approach disclosed by Tencent data department.

Biodiscover was founded in 2012. Supported by strong technical strength of University of Chicago, Biomedical Engineering Center of MIT and multiple U.S. biotech firms, Biodiscover provides Chinese biological researchers with authoritative, prospective and deepgoing scientific research information and technic subjects, offers firms with the latest dynamic condition of biological industries and industrial reports, organizes the latest exhibitions, acadmic conferences and workshops for technology, and builds communication platform for biological industries and people.
Antpedia, which was published during BCEIA in 2007, is a professional information site, network community and value-added services platform based on concept and technical structure of Web 2.0. In recent years, it is one of the fastest growing professional information websites.
The Chinese initiative SNS on medical and biological science.
Biosns is a professional real-name SNS focusing on medical and biological science. It provides multiple services including sharing information, exchanging resources, open recruiting and so on. On Biosns, you can build up close circles with classmates, tutors, friends, schoolmates and peers on the premiss of highly privacy.
Derived from SCUT, it has promoted iGEM organized in MIT to public, and then promote the ideas of “innovation, opening-up, cooperation and inheritance”, hoping to raise social focus on biology and to make more students, scientific workers and scientists active to communicate and cooperate in biological aspects.
Apart from the complete reports from media above, these media as follows have also referred to out exhibition about how synthetic biology treat with bacterial drug resistance, and suggested visiting. We also express thank to them!
