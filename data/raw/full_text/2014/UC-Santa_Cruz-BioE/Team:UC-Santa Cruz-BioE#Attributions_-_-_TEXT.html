Acknowledgements(Thanks!)
In this section we would like to thank the people who made this project possible.
Professor Yat Li for agreeing to be our faculty advisor in such short notice. For letting us undergrads use his lab, resources, and equipment. Lastly, for taking responsibility for our safety in his lab.
Hanyu Wang for allowing us to come into lab everyday (sometimes on very short notice) and being available to answer questions practically any time we needed. For helping us use the autoclave and receiving help from neighbouring labs. Lastly, for her patience and teaching us how to use all the equipment and how to assemble our  MFCs.
The Partch Lab for letting us come in , use their equipment, and access to some reagents.
Jaime Hernandez for locating the freezer stocks of MR-1, helping us make starter cultures of MR-1, and providing us with the protocol for conjugation using E.Coli. Also, for giving us his experienced advice for working with shewanella and for helping.
Professor Chad Saltikov for giving us access to his private stock of MR-1.
Benjamin Abrams for access to the microscopy facilities and for helping us to get images of our biofilms.
