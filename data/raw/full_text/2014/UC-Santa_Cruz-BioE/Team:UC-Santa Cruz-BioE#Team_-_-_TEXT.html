Getting to Know the Group...
Team Leader: Aaron Maloney
Aaron is the primary coordinator of this project.  Much of the work couldn't have been done without him. He'll be our representative at the Igem Jamboree.
Team Captain: Sai Edara
Sai has been pursuing a Bioengineering degree since 2011. His leadership role stems from the desire to create and to influence the world in a positive direction. He also refused to list any of his major accomplishments to add to this wikipage. He's a humble guy.
Our Advisor:Professor Yat Li
Professor Yat Li is an Associate Professor of Chemistry at UC Santa Cruz. He received his Ph.D at the University of Hong Kong and completed a Postdoctoral Fellowship at Harvard University. He's the recipient of many awards for past accomplishments, and has graciously decided to help guide us in the design of a microbial fuel cell.
Team Captain:Marshall Porter
Marshall obtained both Shewanella and the supplies and reagents needed to make our MFC. He was responsible for setting up the microscope as well.
Wiki Designer:Ariah Mackie
Ariah is responsible for editing and designing web coverage of the UC-Santa Cruz-BioE project progress. A total novice to html and CSS before this project, she's got her work cut out for her.
Christian Pettet
Christian is earning his BS in biomolecular bioengineering. He wrote the protocols, cultured Shewanella, prepared the glycerol stock growth media. He also assisted with the transformation of the bacterium.
Arjun Sandhu
Arjun is a bioengineering major. He contributed in the design of the protocols, creation of glycerol stocks,culturing the cells, and cell transformation.
