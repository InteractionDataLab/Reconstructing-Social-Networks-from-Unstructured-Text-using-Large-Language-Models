At the Giant Jamboree, we received a gold medal and an Interlab Study Award. We also won the Overgrad Best Parts Collection.

   PoPS calculator V. 1.0
This calculator allows you to calculate your promoter activity in PoPS (Polymerases Per Second) In order to use it you need to obtain: Fluorescence signal from your culture. Fluorescence per spinach (slope of a standard series). Background fluorescence from your culture (intercept). CFU/L or optical density at 600 nm (OD600) for your examined culture. We have found degradation rate of Spinach in E. coli when grown in LB at 37 °C  so feel free to use this value. You also need a growth rate for your culture, and the copy number of the Spinach sequence per cell. When your values are entered to the calculator you will receive your result, the calculator works using the formula derived here .
