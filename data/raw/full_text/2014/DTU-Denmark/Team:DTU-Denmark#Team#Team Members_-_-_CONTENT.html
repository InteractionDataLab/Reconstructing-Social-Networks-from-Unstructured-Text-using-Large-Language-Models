The 2014 DTU iGEM team is an ambitious team consisting of eight graduate students, four advisors and three main supervisors with a total of five different nationalities. We share a deep interest in chemistry, biotechnology and synthetic biology and work dedicatedly in the cross-disciplinary environment of iGEM. Our group possesses a useful combination of valuable competences, comprising skills in molecular biology, biochemistry, mathematical modelling, scientific programming, project management, entrepreneurship as well as scientific and non-scientific communication. Combined our team has a keen interest in state-of-the-art biotechnology and is eager to contribute to the field of synthetic biology.
<I>Fun is fundamental. There is no way around it. You absolutely must have fun. Without fun, there is no enthusiasm. Without enthusiasm, there is no energy. Without energy, there are only shades of gray.</I>
 - Doug Hall
To create and maintain a dynamic group and enjoyable working atmosphere as well as to keep up our enthusiasm when sitting inside a laboratory while getting snap-chatted by friends on the beach. We of course also went out sunbathing and swimming, enjoyed some cold beers, traditional Danish dinners, and delicious ice creams during the summer.

I had several reasons for joining the DTU iGEM team. I wanted to follow all aspects of a project - from the idea generation to the experimental work as well as the communication and management involved in a big scientific project with several participants. Furthermore I wanted to improve my team working skills and challenge myself.<B>Major contributions</B>

I joined our team to experience how to manage a scientific project from the very beginning and to the end, to improve my team working skills as well as to work with some crazy science. Of course being shielded from the burning sun by spending most of my waking hours in front of a lab bench during the summer also kept me working on the project.

Coordination of the fundraising and sponsorships as well as maintaining a sterile environment in the lab.

Try frozen spinach on a pizza with onion, bacon, goat cheese and a lot of garlic - that is delicious.

The great thing about synthetic biology is that we are not only examining and observing nature, but applying it in new contexts. This together with the the fact that it is a field experiencing rapid development and has a huge future potential. 
iGEM is a unique opportunity for me to be a part of an ambitious team and to develop a project from absolute scratch to final jamboree. It is amazing how different iGEM projects are and I’m looking forward to seeing this year's contributions.<B>Major contributions</B>

As a child I had a dream about studying biotechnology and being able to grow living houses from seeds. As I got older I realized that biology is much more complex than I could ever imagine. I have also always had a great interest within electronics and I like to build circuits to solve a problem. When I heard about iGEM, I immediately know that this was a fusion between two of my greatest interests. In a far future I hope that biological components are so well described that we will be able to program a cell to perform complex functions like growing a wooden living treehouse.<B>Major contributions</B>

As a student at DTU you get to do plenty of project work, however it is mostly carried out individually or in a small group, with very specific goals and a high degree of supervision. iGEM offers the opportunity to work on a much larger project with a high degree of autonomy, where everything from the overall goals and strategy to design of experiments is left for the students to manage. This provides a great opportunity to experience the challenges of actual research projects<B>Major contributions</B>
