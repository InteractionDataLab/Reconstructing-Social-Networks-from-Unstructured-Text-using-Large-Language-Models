During our laboratory work several protocols and recipes were applied. To make sure that the work is documented in a systematical and reproducible manner, we have made a list of the procedures and added it to this page. 
<H1>Protocols</H1><H2 id="BioLector" class="protocol-header">Biolector Measurements</H2><DIV class="protocol BioLector">
Cultures of 2 ml LB were inoculated and incubated at 37 °C and 350 RPM O/N.
The O/N cultures were diluted 15000 folds (first by a 100 dilution in salt water and then by additional 150 folds in LB media). The diluted cultures were distributed in triplicates of 1.5 mL in a BioLector flower plate and were placed in the Biolector. The BioLector was set to incubate at 37 °C and 1000 RPM ensuring optimal mass transfer (oxygen).
The experiment ran for 12.5 hours with measurements of cell density and fluorescence in each well every 5 minutes. The cell density was measured by light scatter at 620 nm and fluorescence was measured at 520 nm with excitation at 488 nm.
</DIV><H2 id="Protocol-for-ligation-for-DNA-cloning" class="protocol-header">DNA Ligation</H2><DIV class="protocol Protocol-for-ligation-for-DNA-cloning">
Each reaction of 20 μL contained:
<UL><LI>1 μL T4 ligase*</LI><LI>2 μL T4 ligase buffer*</LI><LI>The cut DNA fragments</LI><LI>Sterile Milli-Q water up to 20 μL</LI></UL>
The DNA was mixed in a molar ratio of between 3:1 and 5:1 (insert:vector), and the volume of DNA was dependent on the concentration of the fragments and the number of ligations requiring the same fragments.
The reactions were incubated at RT for 2-3 hours.
To assess the background vector self-ligation rate, we always included controls with no insert added. Furthermore we included controls with no insert, and no ligase to estimate the amount of uncut vector.

The ligation products were immediately used to transform cells.

</DIV><H2 id="FACS" class="protocol-header">FACS Measurements</H2><DIV class="protocol FACS">
2 ml LB media was inoculated with a single colony and inoculated at 37 ° and 350 RPM O/N.
The cultures were washed twice in PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) and then resuspended in PBS. The suspensions were diluted in PBS to a concentration yielding 1000-1500 events per second.
</DIV><H2 id="fluorometer-measurement-protocol" class="protocol-header">Fluorometer Measurement</H2><DIV class="protocol fluorometer-measurement-protocol"><P>
A Shimadzu RF-5301PC Spectrofluorophotometer was used.
</P><P>
For Spinach measurements the instrument was configured with an excitation wavelength of 482 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm.
The excitation slit was set to 5 and the emission slit was set to 3. The sizes of the slits determine how wide a range of wavelengths is let through the excitation and emission monochromators. Thus a large slit will increase the signal, but will decrease the wavelength precision of the instrument. The fluorometers spectrum function was used to find the largest slits that did not allow significant amounts of excitation light to be detected at the emission wavelength.
A cuvette with pure water was used to blank the instrument.
</P><P>
A 10 ml sample of culture was centrifuged at 4000g for 5 min. The pellet was washed twice and resuspended in 1 ml 0.9% NaCl. The OD600 of the sample was then measured and DFHBI-1T was added to a final concentration of 200 μM. After 1 hour on ice, the fluorescence of the sample was measured.
</P></DIV><H2 id="gel-protocol" class="protocol-header">Gel Electrophoresis </H2><DIV class="gel-protocol protocol"><P>
1% agarose in 1x TAE buffer is melted and poured into a mold. Ethidium bromide is added to a concentration of 25 μL/L, and is mixed using a pipette tip. (<B>Note: Ethidium bromide is a carcinogen, therefore use gloves when working with the gel.</B> Remove the glove immediately after your work with ethidium bromide in order to avoid contamination of the lab).
A comb is placed in the mold to create wells when the agarose solidifies.
</P><P>
When the gel is set, the comb is removed and the gel is transferred to a vessel containing 1x TAE buffer. A suitable DNA ladder is added to the first well, and each sample is then added to an individual well.
</P><P>
When all samples have been loaded, the gel is run with a constant voltage usually 75-100 V for approximately 30 minutes. A lower voltage and a longer duration generally yields better separation.
</P><P>
The gel is analysed with UV light. The gel can then be photographed or bands can be cut out for further work.

The exact amount of template is not important, and it is very difficult to add too little template. Use our calculator below to calculate the amount of stock solutions to be added to your mastermix. Remember its always a good practice to make mastermix for an additional reaction due to pipetting variations.<TABLE width="350px" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0" style="background-color: transparent;"><TBODY><TR colspan="2">

As the polymerase is temperature sensitive it should only be removed from the freezer for short periods of time, therefore add the polymerase as the final part of your mastermix. When the polymerase have been added to your mastermix, it is important to keep the mastermix on ice. When the mastermix is complete it should be mixed thoroughly by pipetting, not by vortexing since this can ruin the polymerase. The mastermix is aliquoted to individual PCR tubes and the tubes are transferred to a thermo cycler. The annealing temperature should be 5 °C below the melting temperature (Tm) of the primers, this step can be tricky as most Tm predictors tend to disagree. Depending on the polymerase used the elongation time should be 30 seconds per kb of the longest expected fragment. All the primers used in our experimental work, together with their sequences and assigned names, are listed <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/Primers">here</A>.

Plasmids were purified from a 2 mL LB culture with the antibiotic that is used as the plasmid’s selection marker, grown at 350 rpm and 37 °C overnight.
Good aeration is important for obtaining high plasmid concentrations, so tube inclination should optimally be 45 °.
The purification was done with a Zymo Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep Kit, by following the manufacturer’s manual.
