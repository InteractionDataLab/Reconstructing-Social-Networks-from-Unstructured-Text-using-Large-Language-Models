Brief Intro:
Hello,I am Shaohua Chen ,an undergraduate in USTC. Before joining in 2013 USTC-Software ,I knew little about the Internet.To change this bad situation ,I was determined to join in USTC-Software where I could not only learn Internet but also know more biology.So  it's an honour for me to cooperate  with many gifted and responsible teammates ,from whom I learned a lot. In the team , I am in charge of the wiki,during the process ,I find that a person's ability is limited,teamwork makes our work more efficient.
