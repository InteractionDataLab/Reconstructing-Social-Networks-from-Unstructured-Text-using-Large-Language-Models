Team Profile
The DTU iGEM team 2014 is an ambitious team consisting of 11 graduate students, five advisors and three main supervisors with a total of seven different nationalities. We share a deep interest in chemistry, biology and biotechnology and work dedicatedly in the cross-disciplinary environment of iGEM. Our group possesses a unique combination of valuable competences, comprising skills in molecular biology, biochemistry, mathematical modelling, scientific programming, project management, entrepreneurship as well as scientific and non-scientific communication. Combined our team has a keen interest in state-of-the-art biotechnology and is eager to contribute to the field of synthetic biology.
Fun is fundamental. There is no way around it. You absolutely must have fun. Without fun, there is no enthusiasm. Without enthusiasm, there is no energy. Without energy, there are only shades of gray.
- Doug Hall
To create and maintain a dynamic group and enjoyable working atmosphere as well as to keep up our enthusiasm when sitting inside a laboratory when getting snap-chatted by friends on the beach, we of course also went out sunbathing and swimming, enjoyed some cold beers, traditional Danish dinners, and delicious ice creams during the summer.
