At the Giant Jamboree, we received a gold medal and an Interlab Study Award. We also won the Overgrad Best Parts Collection.
Outreach
Initiatives
Documentary
In order to educate younger students we contributed in a documentary dealing with biomimic. About how the nature build and how we can apply that in building synthetic nature from biobricks. Inspiring examples.   This supports the wish to cover different way of learning.  Inspiration. Put it into another context.
Life Science and Beyond
In order to inspire younger university students and spread the word about iGEM we participated in a conference dealing with different initiatives for students interested in expanding their studies to exceed the ordinary study programme. Many students showed  interested in iGEM. Tell about what synthetic biology implies.
Biobrick Workshop
Knowledge sharing is an essential part of the development of project.  We arranged a workshop for the other iGEM teams.
The DTU iGEM team 2014 decided to repeat the success of the BioBrick workshop hosted by the DTU iGEM team of 2013. The BioBrick workshop is a gathering of the iGEM teams of Denmark (KU, SDU and DTU) for a social learning experience about the core of iGEM and genetical engineering.
The BioBrick workshop was hosted over a weekend at DTU where the teams received lectures about; Primer design for USER-cloning, the online tool PHUSER that can be used for designing primers, the core of iGEM, how to receive medals and Wiki design and editing in iGEM. The teams were also introduced to several need to know laboratory procedures; PCR, Gel electrophoresis, Purification of DNA from agarose gels and USER-cloning.
The overall idea was to give the teams a solid introduction to the iGEM competition, the wiki and a basic hands-on experience with essential laboratory techniques when working with engineering of biological systems.
Another important purpose was to generate team feeling within the different teams, this was achieved by social dinners after days of lectures and exercises in the lab.
ESOF 2014
Copenhagen was the host of Euroscience Open Forum 2014. raise awareness of science in the public.
Denmark has scientific tradition. Important element of ESOF 2014 is public outreach programme - Science in the City. Takes place in 21-26 June 2014 in Carlsberg City District.
