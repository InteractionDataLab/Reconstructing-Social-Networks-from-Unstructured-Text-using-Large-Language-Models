Biology and chemistry are my biggest interest and also a sort of hobby to me so I chose to study biotechnology because of the mix of the two. I joined the DTU iGEM team to learn synthetic biology and to get the experience of doing it. I also like the idea that you can go into the lab and create something that has never been made before. When I’m not doing school work I enjoy watching sports like football, handball and boxing but road cycling beats them all. My favorite cake is banana cake with big chunks of chocolate.
