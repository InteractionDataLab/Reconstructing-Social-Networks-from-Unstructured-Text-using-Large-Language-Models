Methods
17.03.2014
1.1 Overnight Preculture
2x5 mL LB medium were inoculated with 50 µL DH5α, aliquoted  for a preculture and incubated overnight (16,5h) at 37 °C.
18.03.2014
1.2 Main Culture
250 mL were inoculated with 5 mL of preculture and incubated until they reached an OD of 0,5. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was washed with HTP buffer and resuspended in 3 mL HTP buffer. In the end, 225 µL DMSO was added to an end concentration of 6-7%. The 50 µL aliquots were frozen in N2(l) and stored at -80 °C.

5.1 Testing Competence and Transformation of DH5α
1 µL plasmid with a Amp-resistance was put on ice for 10 min. A heat shock was induced for 45 s at 42 °C. The sample was put on ice for another 10 min and then incubated in 200 µL LB for 1 h before it was plated onto LB-, ampicillin- and canamycin-plates.
7.1 E. coli DH5α with PSG1164: Overnight-cultures
5 mL LB-medium (with ampicillin) were inoculated with E.coli BL21 pLysS and grown overnight.

Incubate samples for 60 min at 37 °C, then induce a heat shock for 2 min at 45 °C. 5 µL marker and 10 µL of the samples are loaded onto a 1% agarose gel.
Results:
The plasmid digested with NcoI showed two bands, what means, it had two restriction sites. pSG1164 digested with EcoRI looked like it was linearized.
