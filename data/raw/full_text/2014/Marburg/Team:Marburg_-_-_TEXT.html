SURF – Synthetic Units for Redirecting Functionalities
 
SilverSURF Environmental pollution with harmful quantities of heavy metal ions has become an urgent problem.
SilverSURF makes use of the flagellar filament that represents one of the largest scaffolds in nature, and combines it with the unique potential of high-affinity metal-ion-binding domains.
 
CancerSURF Lung cancer is one of the most malignant cancers with poor prognosis.
CancerSURF combines the scaffold of a tetrameric Streptavidin to increase the specificity of a DARPin to detect a prominent tumor marker. This system can find several applications in medical treatment or as a diagnostic tool.
 
RiboSURF Ribosomes are limited to 20 L-amino acids while non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) can use a large number of natural and non-proteinogenic amino acids. RiboSURF aims at combining the huge repertoire of NRPSs with ribosomal protein synthesis to extend the synthetic scope of the ribosome.
 
SURFkiller The work with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) harbours the risk of their release into nature. Therefore, it is necessary to make their survival in nature impossible.
We developed a security system for Bacillus subtilis based on one of the cells essential compartment the ribosome.
