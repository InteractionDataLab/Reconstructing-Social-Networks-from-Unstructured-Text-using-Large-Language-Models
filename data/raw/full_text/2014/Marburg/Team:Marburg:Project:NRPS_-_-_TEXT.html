The aim of our project was to make it possible to combine the advantages of the nonribosomal peptide synthesis with the ribosomal pathway,  i.e. the enormous repertoire of amino acids combined with the ability of the ribosome to synthesize huge proteins.
Introduction
The ribosome is the primary site of protein synthesis in a cell with its advantages being the high reliability of protein synthesis combined  with the possibility of assembling huge proteins from amino acids using mRNA as blueprint. As an adaptor that guides the correct incorporation  of amino acids as specified in the mRNA template ribosomes use aminoacyl-tRNAs. These are generated by activation of the needed amino acid using ATP.  The created adenylate intermediate is then transferred to the 3’ terminus of the corresponding tRNA. This loading reaction of tRNA is catalysed by an  enzyme family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) (Rodnina, 2013). These form multi-synthetase complexes (MSCs) in eukaryotes and archaea that  contain not only the aaRSs themselves but also accessory protein factors for the local scaffolding of tRNAs to the aaRS (Quevillon et al., 1997).  One of these accessory proteins, Arc1p (Figure 2), has been shown to improve the functionality of the MSC in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by facilitating  tRNA binding (Simos et al., 1998).
By contrast to the ribosome, the nonribosomal peptide synthesis occuring in the secondary metabolism of many microbes on the other hand uses modular  multi enzyme complexes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Due to the fusion of different domains nature build highly developed catalysts  for the production of a huge amount of biologically active compounds in evolutionary time (Strieker et al., 2010). The reactions that these modules catalyse  can be compared to equivalent steps in the ribosomal pathway. Especially interesting in this context is the first step catalysed by an adenylation (A) domain  which is the activation of the corresponding amino acid using ATP to yield an adenylate intermediate and thus closely resembles the corresponding step of the  ribosomal pathway (Sieber and Marahiel, 2005). However, in contrast to the limited repertoire of amino acids the ribosome uses there are A-domains known that  can select from hundreds of proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic building blocks. Nevertheless the peptides that are assembled seem to be limited in their size  to about 50 amino acids (Caboche et al., 2008). Intrigued by the multitude of possibilities these A-domains offer we wanted to make their utilization within the  ribosomal pathway possible to overcome the size limit of NRPSs.
To reach that aim, we planned to create a fusion protein that has the capability to activate amino acids derived from NRPSs’ A-domains and tRNA binding capabilities  derived from aaRSs.

Structural characterization of the Arc1p-C tRNA binding domain
Our choice for these two domains were on the one hand PheA (BBa_K1329005) from gramicidinS synthetase  which was already well characterized and has been shown to activate L- and D-phenylalanine also in a non-native context (Stevens et al., 2006) which is a necessary  criterion for the construction of our enzyme. On the other hand the search for a domain that conferred tRNA binding capabilities faced the challenge that the tRNA  binding domain is often established by the correct spatial arrangement of parts of the peptide chain. Finally; in the case of the C-terminal part of Arc1p (Arc1p-C) (BBa_K1329004) from S. cerevisiae, we found a domain that shows these binding capabilities in  one peptide strand and thus was accessible for further engineering by the introduction to our fusion protein. However, structural information on this domain and a  structural understanding of how this domain interacts with tRNA was crucially missing. Therefore, we crystallized Arc1p-C (Figure 2A) and determined its crystal structure  to 1.8 Å resolution (Figure 2B). Data were collected at ID23-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiatian Facility, Grenoble, France.

(B) Crystal structure of Arc1p shown as ribbon (left) – and electrostatic surface representation (right). Dashed lines indicate the putative tRNA binding site.  This fact is underlined by the presence of a glycerol from the cryosolution because glycerol likely mimics ribose sugar of a RNA.
Molecular modelling the Arc1p interaction with tRNA
To understand the binding mode of tRNA to Arc1p-C we used the DUCK-BP server employing the FTdock  algorithm (Gabb et al., 1997) to calculate possible binding modes (Figure 2).  Taking functional aspects into account only the highest scoring docking model seems to represent the real binding mode since all the others lead to a blockade of the tRNA  acceptor stem. Furthermore, solution 1 perfectly matches with the presence of a glycerol potentially mimicking a RNA backbone ribose position (see also Figure 2B).
Figure 3: Calculated docking modes of tRNA to Arc1p-C . Only the first one seems sensible from a functional point of view because all other solutions  hide the 3’ end of the tRNA to which canonical aaRSs transfer amino acids.
Structure-based design of Arc1p-PheA catalysts
In order to create that correct distance between those two domains we wanted to use computational methods to simulate the protein with different linker lengths between  the two domains. As a linker we used repeated GSSG units. With the crystal structure of PheA known we still needed to solve the crystal structure of Arc1p-C and find the  binding mode of the tRNA to Arc1p-C in order to build a precise molecular model of rationally design  suitable linker lengths that balance between on the one hand enough  flexibility for favourable positioning of tRNA and activated amino acid and a sufficient increase in local reactant concentration for efficient catalysis to occur on the  other hand. The results of the simulation of 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 GSSG units suggested that the best distance that should lead to the highest catalyst activity is reached with  two GSSG units (Figure 4). For the testing of our prediction, we synthesized the fusion protein with these five different linker lengths.

The 8x linker was constructed from a synthesized template and integrated into pET28a by Gibson assembly. The other lengths were created by round-the-horn site directed  mutagenesis using phosphorylated primers and a ligation after the PCR. All the proteins (Figure 4C) were produced as His6 tagged fusion proteins. For testing the catalytic  activity of each mutant we used an LC-MS based assay. Since the phosphate backbone leads to a multiple negative charge the direct analysis by mass spectrometry probably  would lead to a too poor sensitivity to discriminate loaded and unloaded tRNAs (Figure 4D). Thus we decided to make an indirect measurement based on an established method.  After the reaction mixture was incubated we separated the tRNA from all the other components by size-exclusion chromatography. The obtained mixture of loaded and unloaded  tRNAs was split and one half kept on ice while the other was treated with a base to cleave the oxoester bond. Afterwards the amount of released amino acid in the base  treated sample was detected by LC-MS using the untreated sample as a negative control.
Measurements showed that all fusion constructs were able to load L- as well as D-phenylalanine onto tRNAPhe. As the computational molecular model already  suggested the varying linker length showed a clear influence on the yield levels with the 2x-GSSG linker showing the highest catalytic activity yielding 11% loaded  tRNA after 30 min while the 8x-construct reached only a maximum of 3% loaded tRNA as well as the linker-less version. The remaining constructs showed intermediate  results in good correspondence with the computational model (Figure 4B).

Furthermore the linking of the two domains leading to the increase in reactant concentration and the correct spatial arrangement is indeed important for the catalytic  effect to occur since a mixture of the unlinked domains showed only background levels of aminoacylation (Figure 5). Further negative controls included testing the  reaction without enzyme or ATP. As a positive control to evaluate the method phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) was used. A time-dependent measurement of the aminoacylation  level showed that a maximum is reached after 30 min. To test if other tRNAs except for the tRNAPhe can be aminoacylated using our fusion construct we carried out  aminoacylation assays with five additional Escherichia coli tRNAs (Figure 6). The measurements suggest in agreement with previous studies that all tRNAs were loaded  similarly well.

Improve a brick
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are a most fascinating subject because of the huge amount of biologically  active compounds they produce that show a broad spectrum of clinical applications that even includes their use as  last resort antibiotics, antitumor or antifungal agents and immunosuppressants. These interesting properties especially  derive from the nonribosomal peptide synthetases unique feature to incorporate non-proteinogenic features such as  heterocycles, fatty acids, macrocycles, D-amino acids and other non-proteinogenic amino acids. Last years’ team of the university Heidelberg used nonribosomal peptide synthetases of Brevibacillus parabrevis in order to synthesize a tripeptide by  interchanging modules of an already existing NRPS cluster. The problem of previous applications such as these is  that the size of synthesized peptides is limited. Even naturally occurring peptides synthesized nonribosomally seem to  have an upper limit of 50 amino acids (Caboche et al., 2008). Therefore it would be great to establish a system that  uses these capabilities to introduce non-proteinogenic amino acids but is able to overcome the size limit of the  synthesized peptides. That is why we improved the brick BBa_K1152005 which contains the expression cassette for NRPS synthesizing a Phe-Orn-Leu-tripeptide. In RiboSURF, we improved the A-domain that activates phenylalanine (BBa_K1329005) in that  nonribosomal peptide synthetase. Our improvement makes it possible  to use the NRPS module even in its non-natural environment isolated from its NRPS context. By the fusion of the module  from NRPS to a tRNA binding domain the catalytic activity of this NRPS module was introduced to the ribosomal pathway  which has much more powerful capabilities regarding the protein synthesis as it can assemble huge proteins using RNA as a blueprint.
