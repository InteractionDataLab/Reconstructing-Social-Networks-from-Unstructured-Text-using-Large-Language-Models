We had a questionnaire survey to ensure the feasibility, and took some interviews with some professionals. Those provided us with great useful suggestions. After that, we had interschool communications and freshman teach-in to let others know more about our project and our team, and we got useful feedback which improved our project at the same time.
</P></LI><LI class="img"><P>We devised one questionnaire and received 240 feedbacks in total including 35 people working with radiation and 205 not. Here are the statistical results and analyze to questions.</P><P>According to survey result, we can see that there is widespread exist of radiation in working and living environment of interviewees, most of whom feel uncomfortable with it. However, when the interviewees were asked if they would buy monitoring instrument willingly, merely 6.3% of non-radioactive practitioners would buy definitely and 58% if necessary. Among radioactive practitioners, 40% agreed.  Based on the statistics result, we believe that primarily our project aims to radioactive practitioners. During the project investigation, we also got interviewees’ opinions and attitudes towards synthetic biology. From result, most people once ever heard of it or even remained unknown with it. Despite this, almost all of them agreed that much more public promotion ought to be advocated for citizens’ understanding and that we should use synthetic biology to benefit human beings. Nevertheless, most interviewees held worries about the security of synthetic biology. During the questionnaire investigation, we had prepared souvenirs printed with our team logo for interviewees and introduced our project and the booklet of iGEM, eager to their enthusiasm towards our project and iGEM Competition.</P></LI><LI class="img"><P>After questionnaire investigation, we conducted exclusive interviews with radioactive practitioners particularly including staff in Radiation Monitoring Department in Datong Nanjiao Environmental Protection Bureau, doctor of Radiology Department in Datong No.4 Renmin hospital and engineer in Lianyungang Tianwan Nuclear Power Station.</P><P>We received many great ideas and suggestions from professionals we interviewed. In the meantime, we discovered the flaw of the current detecting methods, so it strengthened our faith of providing anytime-anyplace radiation precaution for related workers. </P><CENTER><P>environment protection bureua</P></CENTER><CENTER><P>environment protection bureua</P></CENTER><CENTER><P>nuclear power station</P></CENTER><CENTER><P>hospital</P></CENTER></LI><LI class="img"><P>In August,2014, our teammates attended the Central China iGem Consortium (CCiC), which was organized by Huazhong Agricultural University. In two days of communication, we established great cooperation with 10 other universities in China and exchanged our ideas on different projects. Moreover, we joined in the online group of iGem for further cooperation.</P><P>On August 28th, we had a meet-up with the iGemers of Beijing University of Chemical Technology. We briefed each other about the current situation of projects and mutually provided with suggestions. Especially, we offered them advice on micro-fluidic chips and in return, they pointed out the deficiency of our hardware.</P><P>Thanks to the precious communication with other teams, we acquired more ideas, guidance and energy to perfect our iGem projects.</P><P>On September 29th, iGemers from Lanzhou University came to us and had a profound communication. We exchanged our ideas about the key points in projects. We offered them some suggestions on making instrument and choosing chip materials, and in return, they helps us promote the device design. In our free discussion, we shared experience in the previous competitions and team building.
</P></LI><LI class="img"><P>In the meantime, we held a info session on iGem for freshmen in our college, managing to make more excellent students to participate in iGem. It turned out that it was totally a great success that we achieved our goal</P></LI><LI class="img"><P>Acknowledgment:
