BIT Logic：Forget Parameters
Black box, both outside and inside. No more attention we pay to what happens in the box, but we know exactly what would come out if we put the samples in, just like the f(x) between y and x. Of course, the black box is based on much experiment statistics.
Precisely Designed Micro-fluidic chip
The bio-chip works as more than a container of sensor and amplifier . As for the structure, it has chambers and channels for culturing sensors and amplifier, which are responsible for receiving and passing signals. On the edge of the hexagon are detecting pools, where amplifier generate fluorescence . If you want to detect another pool, all you need to do is rotate it specific degrees.
Laser Cutting : From 2D to 3D
What is the best way of making the construction of device? 3D print? No! SLA? No! It's laser cutting! You may consider 3D print and SLA are convenient. However, when it comes to price, quality and good-looking, laser cutting will be a better choice. Besides, the convertion from 2D to 3D is another marvellous feeling you can feel from our device.
Light Path:All for accurancy
The optical structure determines the precision of our device. A senser above the chip does the work of calibration while the other one down to the bottom measures the fluorescence. They work like teammates, coordinately, hand in hand ensure the precision of our data.
Automation : Detect wherever & whenever you want
Micro chip and device are so precisely designed that you can use the whole system with no difficulty. Just add what you want to detect in the microchip , insert the chip into the slot , and the data would directly shown on the screen .moreover ,we can connect the device to PC ,and the prime data would be shown directly on the screen for further analysis.the figure below is a form of prime data shown on the PC screen .
What shown above is the data of our device. To confirm that the system is useful ,we used E.coli which can express GFP for detection. We cultured the bacteria at the range from 2h to 8h ,and detect the relative GFP they expressed . Have a notice at the Y axis . for the Data is based on our own standard . We can clearly find out that the data is the lower half of the "s" curve ,just in line with the theory.
The picture below is a engineering prototype of our measurement device . Data is directly shown as the bar charts on the LCD screen .
introduce structure function
As engineering is a significant feature of iGEM, we design and manufacture our bio-chip to supplement the biological part.
It has culturing pools and channels for sensors and amplifier, which function as receiving and passing signals. Detecting pools are on the edge of the hexagon，where amplifier generates fluorescence.             Hexagon shape is easier to manufacture than a round shape and has higher data throughput than a square shape. Several detecting pools helping to ensure the precision of the measurement.
This well-designed tiny chip plays an irreplaceable role in connecting biological parts and device. What’s more? It creates an inert, non-toxic atmosphere for bacteria, and it is optically transparent, simply manufactured, and economically cost. In addition, its miniaturization makes the whole device even more portable.
key words:Hexagon shape; Three layers
The sensor is cultured in the sensor pool of 3mm diameter in the first layer and we call it chamber A.
The Sensor group produces AHL molecules when they are stimulated by radiation. AHL go through the semi-permeable membrane (between the first and second layer) and are transmitted to the amplifier, which is cultured in a three-millimeter-in-diameter pool in the second layer, or say chamber B. afterwards, the amplifier are injected through the one-millimeter-in-diameter chamber C，which is closer to the center in the first layer
.
To make the liquid go through layers, we design a standard channel that drill through the bottom edge of the upper layer and the top edge of the lower layer.
When the liquid in a certain velocity is added at the chamber C, it directly flows into the chamber B through the channel A. Then press on chamber A with an injector to help the AHL molecules go through the semi-permeable membrane. Afterwards, the liquid then go through the long curly channel B on the third layer, and reaches the final five-millimeter-in-diameter detecting pool in the second layer. If the liquid is redundant, it will brim over and flow to the drainage hole in 1mm diameter which is near the edge of the hexagon in the first layer. This structure helps the AHL and amplifier mix sufficiently. Finally amplifier generates fluorescence. Then our device will detect the fluorescence.
Material
PDMS glue;Semi-permeable membrane(24mm diameter inserts,0.4μm pore size)
Principle
Based on the simplified mechanism, Sensor bacteria detects radiation, and produces AHL molecules. The AHL penetrate  the semi-permeable membrane and transport to  the amplifier to the detection hole.
Requirement
basic function of micro-fluidic chip contains: 1 separate culture of sensor and amplified bacteria 2 deliver the AHL from sensor to amplifier, and mix it with amplifier bacteria 3 fluorescence produced by sensor B can be detected. 4 detect multiple samples at a period
