Future Plans
The Real Vegan Cheese team has successfully crowd source fundraised $37K and is committed to continuing the project.  For the iGEM competition we have successfully cloned into E. coli for both human and bovine casein proteins, sequenced to confirm cloning, and cloned into yeast.
Future experiments include:
Expression and purification of all proteins
Cheese formulation
Cheese production
Cloning into E. coli once we have the sequence for Narwhal genes, and work towards Narwhal cheese.
We have many questions to answer including:
How much cheese protein will we be able to make per liter?
How much will it cost?
Can we estimate the final production cost of the vegan cheese?
How does it compare to existing vegan cheese and normal cheese products?
Find cost of bulk milk for cheesemaking. What do current cheesemakers pay?
Find cost of running bioreactors
Figure out retail vs. production cost cheese markups
Check if alibaba bulk ingredient prices are realistic
Find cost of cheesemaking
As part of the future planning we incorporated as a California State Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation under the official name Real Vegan Cheese on August 4th, 2014 with a purpose to promote, encourage, facilitate and engage in free and open scientific research and education. We have elected a board of directors to guide future projects.
