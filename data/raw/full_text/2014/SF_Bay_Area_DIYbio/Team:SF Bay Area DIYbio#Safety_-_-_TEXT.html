SAFETY
Lab safety considerations for this project
Team members have received safety training instruction relevant to specific experiments.  Both BioCurious and Counter Culture Labs have specific multi-person biosafety teams.  One of the team advisors, Patrik D’haeseleer, is on the safety team for both labs and has briefed both teams on the project. Both labs strictly meet the guidelines for BSL-1.
The risks for members working on this project include the risk of RG1 lab strains.  There is no risk to the general public, since we are working with auxotrophic baker’s yeast carrying a plasmid expressing food proteins. To mitigate the risks to the environment from this project we are using yeast that can’t make its own uracil and must be grown on media containing supplement uracil.  This yeast strain is highly unlikely to be viable outside of specific lab conditions. Another safety precaution we have put in place to make sure our project stays contained is that only plasmids will be allowed to leave the lab and be transported from one location to the other – no live yeast or purified protein at this stage.  As we work on the project we continue to address safety considerations and ensure that the experiments and work is done with best lab practices.
