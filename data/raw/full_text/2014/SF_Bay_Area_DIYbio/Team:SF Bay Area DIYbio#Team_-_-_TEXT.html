The Real Vegan Cheese iGEM Team
The Real Vegan Cheese team has emerged from the San Francisco Bay Area to create the world’s first real vegan cheese. The team is a collaborative effort between Oakland-based Counter Culture Labs and Sunnyvale’s BioCurious.  We are all ages and backgrounds and worked collaboratively to bring this project together.
TEAM MEMBERS
Mohammed Almahbashi
BS, Biology - Human Physiology
He is currently student at City college of San Francisco pursuing a Biotechnology lab assistant certificate. He is also currently an intern at UCSF Mission Bay. His lab studies the cell Cycle and how the post translational modification of proteins regulate cell cycle with the contribution of DNA damage response. His lab uses the Yeast as our system Model to study the DNA damage respond in Yeast.
Aaron Byran
Molecular Biology Undergrad
Member of BioPrinter community project and Real Vegan Cheese.
Wes Chang
Ph.D. Mechanical Engineering
With background in engineering, Wes has extensive experiences in biomedical research, specifically involving cell biology and microtechnology. Currently, Wes is working the pharmaceutical industry but continues to be interested in new technologies and developments in the biology and biotechnology.
Maria Chavez
MBA, Global Management
Maria has a diverse background and experience. She has been involved with BioCurious and the community lab projects for over 3 years. She is enthusiastic about science and DIY Bio. The Real Vegan Cheese project includes a full range of issues and challenges that drew her interest in the project.
Meenakshi Choudhary
PhD, Biosciences
Meenakshi's research interest focus on learning innovation. she has been involved in different research project like Algae and Cyanobacterial bioremediation, anti diabetic property of Cyanobacteria and Bacterial Bioluminiscence and working with BioCurious for over 2 years. The vegan Cheese project is very interesting and challenging to her.
Carl Crott
BaMF biohacker / Self-taught programmer
Research interests include microfluidics and codified wetlab protocols. Core engineering discipline is in full stack web development and automated infrastructure. Both a technical developer and conversational in research concepts. Experience in scaling, application testing/hardening, embedded systems, parametric modelling, biochemistry, web scraping, design and UIs. Bad at writing in 3rd person.
