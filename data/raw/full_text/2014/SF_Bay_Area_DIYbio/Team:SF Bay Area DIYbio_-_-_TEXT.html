What’s vegan cheese?
Real Vegan Cheese is a not a cheese substitute! It all starts with regular old baker's yeast. Through synthetic biology, we engineer our yeast to become milk-protein factories. Our milk proteins will then be combined with water and vegan oil to make Vegan Milk, which will ultimately be converted into Real Vegan Cheese through standard cheese-making processes - just like cheese made from cow or goat milk!
