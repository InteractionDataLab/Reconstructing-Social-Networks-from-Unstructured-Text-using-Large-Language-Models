The Real Vegan Cheese iGEM Team
Real Vegan Cheese is made possible by the combined efforts of our team of 24+ biohackers and citizen scientists working out of two open community labs in the San Francisco Bay Area: Counter Culture Labs in Oakland, CA and BioCurious in Sunnyvale, CA. The Real Vegan Cheese project is open to collaborators of all skill levels and from all walks of life. We are excited to enter our Real Vegan Cheese project into the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) 2014 competition. We are excited to be part of a larger global community consisting of students and biohackers from over 30 countries!  Below are those that made this project a reality.
CORPORATE SPONSORS
Many corporate sponsors supplied materials and discounts through iGEM or to our project specifically.
Clontech
Teknova
IDTdna
DNA2.0
THANK YOU FOR THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT
This project would not have been possible without the support and donations from people around the world to our Indiegogo Campaign .  The campaign had 696 funders raise $37,369.  This funding is vital, not just for the iGEM competition but as a foundation to move forward with the project.  We learned as a result of this campaign, that there is enormous support for this type of synthetic biology project among the Vegan community.
DIY COMMUNITY
The project could not have moved foreward without the support of the DIYBio Community.  Having access to lab space at BioCurious and Counter Culutre Labs is proof that coumminty science projects can be done.
TALKING ABOUT US
We are fortunate that many journalists and bloggers took an interest in our project.  Thank you to all the sites that featured Real Vegan Cheese.  Their coverage helped spread the word and was invaluable to our fundraising efforts.

OUR TEAM
Everyone on the team was involved in some capacity. We had weekly, and sometimes bi-weekly team meetings to plan, and experiments throughout the week as schedules allowed.  Specific project contributions include:
Rebecca led, and Patrik, Craig, Ahnon, Marc, Maria, and Bryce Wolf contributed to the discussion around Ethical, Legal, Societal and Environmental Issues.
Ashley, Craig, Patrik, Advait, Johan and Rachel helped with the DNA design, including codon optimization, and checking for restriction and protease sites.
Rachel took charge of sequence validating our constructs, with some help from Craig
Ashley, Patrik, Marc, Benjamin, Teddy, Jamie, Carl, Advait, Maria, and many more helped with the IndieGogo fundraising campaign
Craig, Johan, Patrik, and Marc ordered reagents
Maria, Advait and Patrik kept us on track with iGEM deliverables
Aaron, Meenakshi, Rachel, Lafia, Nikola, and Johan did most of the experimental work (but we all got to contribute!)
Jared Morgan designed our awesome graphics
Rachel and Craig led a class on proper documentation and lab notebook taking techniques
Josiah led a class on SDS Page Gels
Carl helped with web layout on the iGEM wiki
Emi arranged for sequencing pickups
Marc Juul Christoffersen (treasurer), Craig Rouskey (chair), Maria Chavez (secretary), Carl Crott, Johan Sosa, Moises Cassab, Lafia Sebastian, Meenakshi Choudhary, Rachel Linzer all joined the projects Board of Directors
