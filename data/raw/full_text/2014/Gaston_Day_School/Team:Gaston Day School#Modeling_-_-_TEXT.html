Isobutanol Pathway
The figure above shows the native Isobutanol production pathway in E. coli. The figure is from Figure 1 in Atsumi, S., Hanai, T., and Liao, J.C., (2008). Non-fermentative pathways for synthesis of branched-chain higher alcohols as biofuels. Nature 451(3):86.
Isobutanol Production Pathway
Figure 2 shows the isobutanol production pathway in greater detail. This figure is from figure 1 in Atsumi, S., Wu, T., Eckl, E., Hawkins, S., Buelter, T., & Liao, J. (2009). Engineering the Isobutanol Biosynthetic Pathway in Escherichia Coli by Comparison of Three Aldehyde Reductase/Alcohol Dehydrogenase Genes. Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2010) 85.651-657.
Mechanism for GlmY and GlmZ Actvity
This model comes from figure 8 from Urban, J.H., and Vogel, J., (2008). Two Seemingly Homologous Noncoding RNAs Act Hierarchically to Activate glmS mRNA Translation. PLoS Biology 6(3):631.
