Cd Detector
K1320000
In 2012 our team created a cadmium detector part K824008. We also created several other heavy metal detectors, but since our team was unable to gain access to other heavy metals due to our BS1 status, and cadmium was quickly becoming a local issue, we decided to focus on improving our cadmium detector. This first detector was sensitive to 10 mM of cadmium. This year, with the addition of sensitivity tuners, we improved the sensitivity four-fold. We can now detect 2.5 mM of cadmium, which is a much more realistic and useful concentration to find. At 2.5 mM of cadmium, the presence is not necessarily apparent in water, but is still above safe levels and the federal limit.
