Complexity in town planning and complexity in religion
In the last days Stefanie met an architect and a priest to discuss complexity in their occupational field. Both conversations were highly interesting and at the same very different. It was fascinating and inspiring to once change the point of view and to approach complexity from new positions. For the priest, Josef Fuisz, the struggle of men with complexity might be represented by the following psalm (42.5):
Why, my soul, are you downcast?
Why so disturbed within me?
Put your hope in God,
for I will yet praise him,
my Savior and my God.
Other interesting interviews were done in various fields. For example a philosophy teacher, a physicist, a nano-technologist and a theoretical computer scientist were partners for talks. From these interviews we expect to gain insight into the diversity of complexity. It became even more clear than before that complexity can be found in many different fields.
