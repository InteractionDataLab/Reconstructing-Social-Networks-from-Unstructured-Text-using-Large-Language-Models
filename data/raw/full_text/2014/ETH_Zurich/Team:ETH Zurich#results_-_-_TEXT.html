Used and Characterized Pre-Existing Parts
Experience - Promoter (LuxR/3OC6-HSL regulated), BBa_R0062: the promoter's EC50 could be shown to be dependent on the amount of regulator LuxR (BBa_C0062) in the system by using the three different constitutive promoters BBa_J23100 , BBa_J23109 , and BBa_J23111 for the production of LuxR. The amount of regulator also demonstrated an influence on the promoter's basal expression or leakiness. Additionally, it could be determined that the promoter can also be activated by the regulators LasR (BBa_C0179) and RhlR (C0171) thus showing crosstalk with these two quorum sensing systems.
Experience - Promoter (LasR/3OC12-HSL regulated), BBa_R0079: it could be shown that this promoter is not only activated by the regulator LasR (BBa_C0179) , but also be activated by the regulators LuxR (BBa_C0062) and RhlR (C0171) . Therefore, it shows crosstalk with these two quorum sensing systems.
Experience - Promoter (RhlR/C4-HSL regulated), BBa_I14017: the amount of regulator RhlR (C0171) had an influence on the promoter's basal expression level or leakiness as well as on the steepness of the response. This was investigated using two different RBSes controlling the production level of RhlR, i.e. the RBS B0034 and a RBS optimized for rhlR using the Salis Lab RBS Calculator [13] .
Experience - Regulator LuxR, BBa_R0062: it could be shown , that the regulator LuxR not only activates the promoter BBa_R0062 together with 3CO6-HSL, the product of the enzyme LuxI (BBa_C0161) , but also with 3CO12-HSL ( LasI (BBa_C0178) product) and C4-HSL ( RhlI (BBa_C0170) product).
Experience - Regulator LasR, BBa_C0179: it could be shown , that the regulator LasR activates the promoter BBa_R0079 mainly together with 3CO12-HSL, the product of the enzyme LasI (BBa_C0178) and only to a minor extend with 3CO6-HSL ( LuxI (BBa_C0161) product) and C4-HSL ( RhlI (BBa_C0170) product).
Experience - Regulator RhlR, BBa_C0171: it could be shown , that the regulator RhlR not only activates the promoter BBa_R0071 together with C4-HSL, the product of the enzyme RhlI (BBa_C0170) , but also with 3CO6-HSL ( LuxI (BBa_C0161) product) and 3CO12-HSL ( LasI (BBa_C0178) product).
Experience - Promoter, BBa_J23100: the constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 was compared to the promoters BBa_J23109 and BBa_J23111 within our system by placing each in a construct in front of the quorum sensing regulator LuxR (BBa_C0062) . The system behaved as expected by model predictions, thus confirming an increase in promoter strength from BBa_J23109 over BBa_J23111 to BBa_J23100 .

The system behaved as expected by model predictions, thus confirming an increase in promoter strength from BBa_J23109 over BBa_J23111 to BBa_J23100 .
Experience - Autoinducer synthetase for the AHL molecule 3OC6-HSL, BBa_C0161: by placing into a millifluidic chip an alginate bead containing sender cells, which are constitutively expressing LuxI (BBa_C0161) in vicinity to a bead containing receiver cells with a construct producing sfGFP in presence of 3OC6-HSL it could be shown that signal transduction was successful . Thus it could be confirmed that the synthetase is producing a quorum sensing molecule.
Our Favorite New Characterized Parts
Main Page - sfGFP under riboregulated promoter (RhlR/C4-HSL, RR12), BBa_K1541009: this riboregulated promoter construct contains the quorum sensing promoter BBa_I14017 which can be activated in presence of RhlR (BBa_C0171) and the homoserine lactone C4-HSL, the product of the enzyme reaction catalyzed by RhlI (BBa_C0170) , succeeded by the gene for sfGFP. However, the promoter BBa_I14017 without riboregulation shows leakiness. Together with the ribogegulator 12 [18] the leakiness could be reduced .
Main Page - rhlI with optimized RBS, BBa_K1541017: this part is can be compared to the part BBa_I9026 , but contains instead of the RBS BBa_B0034 an RBS which was specifically optimized for rhlI (C0170) using the Salis Lab RBS Calculator [13] . With higher levels of RhlI, the production of the enzyme's product C4-HSL can theoretically be improved.
