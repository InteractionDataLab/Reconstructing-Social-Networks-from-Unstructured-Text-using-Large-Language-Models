Crosstalk experiments continued
Monday, 6th September
Until now we thought Lux was crosstalking too much with las and tried to improve the pair Las-Rhl. However we realized today that Rhl is difficult to improve and that our induction curves of Las and Lux are good enough, since Las is never responding to lux-HSL and we only have to be in a range of las-HSL concentrations that is below 10 nM to avoid Lux responding to las-HSL.
