1 Characterization of two-order crosstalk on the promoter
1.1 Background information
1.1.1 System considered
1.1.2 Modeling crosstalk
1.2 First-order crosstalk
1.2.1 First Level crosstalk: LasR binds to different HSL and activates the promoter
1.2.2 Second Level crosstalk: other regulatory proteins, like LuxR, bind to their natural HSL substrate and activates the promoter
1.3 Second order crosstalk: Combination of both cross-talk levels
1.4 Results
