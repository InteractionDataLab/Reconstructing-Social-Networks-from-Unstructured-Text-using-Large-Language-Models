Emergence of the pattern
Every cell of the cellular automaton on the grid below computes an XOR of the two signals coming from above in the figure below. XOR means that if only one of the two signals (red or blue) is received, the cell receiving should turn ON (and show green fluorescence), whereas if none or both of the signals are received, the cell should stay OFF (do nothing).
Pass the mouse on the different colonies to understand how they process the signals coming from the top and make the pattern appear.
