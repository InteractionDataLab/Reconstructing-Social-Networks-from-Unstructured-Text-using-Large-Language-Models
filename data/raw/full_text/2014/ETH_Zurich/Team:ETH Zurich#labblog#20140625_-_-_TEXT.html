Week 5: Assembly strategy and steady states derivation
Wednesday, June 25th
We will use Gibson assembly to assemble our constructs, and have now a construct assembly strategy. We know the list of experiments we want to carry (cross-talk between quorum sensing molecules, quorum sensing leakiness with or without riboswitch, cross-talk between integrases, integrase activity and logic gate behaviour) and the exact sequences of base units we will assemble (lux, rhl, las promoter and repressor units, reporter units, logic units with 3 different integrases, constitutive AHL production units for diffusion test, backbone units).
Exemple of sequences of base units.
From the modeling side, we calculated analytically the steady state of the integrase and terminator modules, and it  appears that the deterministic model gives a binary steady state corresponding to an XOR gate. This is what we expected, it confirms that deterministic model in our case is interesting for the study of dynamics of the whole system, and not for steady state calculations. So we are now moving to dynamic studies.
