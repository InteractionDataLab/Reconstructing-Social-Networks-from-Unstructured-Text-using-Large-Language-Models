Sequencing, Transformation, antibiotic stock preparation
Thursday, July 3rd
Sequencing results
Biobricks of the plasmids piG0001, piG0015 and piG002 show the correct sequences
E coli Transformation
Transformation of E. coli with pSEVA181, pSEVA271, pSEVA291, pSEVA561.
Addition of 1 μL DNA to 75 μL competent cells (thawed on ice), put samples on ice for approximately 20 min  Heat shock: 90 s at 42 °C
Addition of SOC to samples, let cells recover for  ca. 1h  at 37 °C, 220 rpm
Plate 100 μL of bacteria suspension on LB-agar-plates containing the appropriate antibiotics (pSEVA181: Ampicillin (200 μg/L), pSEVA271 and pSEVA291: Kanamycin (50 μg/L), pSEVA561: Tetracycline (20 μg/L))
Let bacteria grow overnight at 37 °C
Antibiotic stock preparation
Preparation of antibiotics stock:
2 g Ampicillin were dissolved in 10 mL H2O and sterile filtered
0.5 g Kanamycin were dissolved in 10 mL H2O and sterile filtered
0.34 g Chloramphenicol were dissolved in 10 mL Ethanol
