Week 13 : Steady state quorum sensing fitted and human practice survey launched !
Wednesday, August 20th
Our first diffusion try with highlighter ink !

The design of punched agar doesn't seem to be the best but at least we can see something. Diffusion experiments with different designs are running now.
We have been fitting quorum sensing experiments at steady state to a Hill function and found some quorum sensing parameters.
Fitting quorum sensing Hill function parameters thanks to steady-state data from experiments. Check the corresponding article for more details.
We wrote a survey in English , in French and in German on complexity for our human practice project. We expect 500 responses.
