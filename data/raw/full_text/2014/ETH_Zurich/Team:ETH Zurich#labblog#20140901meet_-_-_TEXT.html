Week 15 : Integrase parameters retrieved from Bonnet's paper, problems with integrase experiments
Monday 1st September
We finally managed to retrieve integrase parameters from Bonnet et al.'s [9] paper steady state behavior curve. You can check the corresponding article for more details. We can get Hill function parameters this way, but still need dynamic data from our own experiments to retrieve dynamic parameters (i. e. degradation rates).
Integrases don't seem to switch the terminator at the moment, maybe because of a mutation that we found in their sequence.
