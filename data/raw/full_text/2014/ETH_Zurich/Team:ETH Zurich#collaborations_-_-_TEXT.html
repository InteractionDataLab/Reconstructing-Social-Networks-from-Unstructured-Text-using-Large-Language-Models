Collaborations
Edinburgh: Theoretical fusion of our projects
We collaborated with the Edinburgh iGEM team . As they focus on metabolic wiring and we search for orthogonal ways for cells to communicate, it seemed natural to combine our two projects, at least on the modeling level. You can find the fusion of our models here .
Aalto Helsinki: Low Budget PCR of Colombia iGEM team
The Colombia iGEM team organized a challenge to develop low budget protocols. The importance of this challenge is to make molecular biology processes more cost-efficient and make them available worldwide. The following three processes were suggested for total or partial modification:
DNA Extraction
Transformation
PCR
We participated in this challenge and attempted together with the Aalto-Helsinki iGEM team to develop a PCR method not requiring a thermocycler. Watch the video for a more detailed description of the process and check the pdf document below for our results considering the costs and in terms of experimental outcomes.
Figure 1 We received a sticker for participating in this challenge
Paris Bettencourt: iGEM newsletter
Our team participates in the iGEM newsletter produced by the Paris Bettencourt iGEM team . Every two weeks a new issue is published where the team and its members are presented and the progress of the project is documented.
Virginia: Survey filling
We helped Virginia team with gathering answers for their survey and earned this funny badge.
We thank our sponsors:
