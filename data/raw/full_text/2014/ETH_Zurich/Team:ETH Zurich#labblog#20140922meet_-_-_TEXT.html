Week 18 : Decisive meeting
Monday, September 22th
This meeting was a turning point of our iGEM adventure. We reviewed all the experiments that had been done so far. Most of them concerns quorum sensing and its non-orthogonality. We summed up the results in a three-layer graphs.
The dry lab part presented for the first time a whole-cell model. With the parameters estimated, the model actually implemented an XOR gate. However, leakiness of promoters and crosstalk seemed to be affecting the robustness of our design.
As all our experiments were done in our plasmids, we have to standardize them into the Biobrick format. This year, the deadline corresponds to the delivery in Boston of the biobricks. Thus, it is becoming slowly urgent...
