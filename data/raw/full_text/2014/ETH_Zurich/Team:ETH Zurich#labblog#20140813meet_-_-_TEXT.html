Week 12 : Nice cross-talk results, problems with producer strains, and with synthesis of our Las riboregulated sensor
Wednesday, August 13th
We have a lot of results for cross-talk experiments. Check the corresponding article for more details. For the moment lux promoter doesn't respon to other AHLs. This is a good step towards orthogonality.
Current challenges :
AHL producer strains are not producing enough. We have to improve the RBS.
GenScript has problems to produce our Las sensor with riboregulator RR42.
We have a project description !
