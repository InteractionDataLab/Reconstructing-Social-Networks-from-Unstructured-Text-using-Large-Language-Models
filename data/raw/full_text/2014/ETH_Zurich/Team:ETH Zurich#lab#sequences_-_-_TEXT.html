Expression of sfGFP is induced when RhlR bound to 4C-HSL bind to pRhlR. The p15A is present at a copy number of approximately 15 to 25 [35] .
piG0062
Expression of sfGFP is induced when LuxR bound to 3OC6-HSL bind to pLuxR. The cis-repressive element (crR12y) inhibits the translation of sfGFP, since the RBS is blocked by secondary structures of the mRNA. The p15A is present at a copy number of approximately 15 to 25 [35] .
piG0065
Expression of sfGFP is induced when LuxR bound to 3OC6-HSL bind to pLuxR. The cis-repressive element (crR12y) inhibits the translation of sfGFP, since the RBS is blocked by secondary structures of the mRNA. The transcript of the trans-activating element (taR12y) binds to the transcript of the cis-repressive element, hence the RBS is not blocked anymore. The two elements build a riboregulator that decreases leakiness of pLuxR. A biologically neutral spacer sequence was designed using the web application R2oDNA [34] . The p15A is present at a copy number of approximately 15 to 25 [35] .
piG0066
Expression of sfGFP is induced when RhlR bound to 4C-HSL bind to pRhlR. The cis-repressive element (crR12) inhibits the translation of sfGFP, since the RBS is blocked by secondary structures of the mRNA. The transcript of the trans-activating element (taR12) binds to the transcript of the cis-repressive element, hence the RBS is not blocked anymore. The two elements build a riboregulator that decreases leakiness of pLuxR. A biologically neutral spacer sequence was designed using the web application R2oDNA [34] . The p15A is present at a copy number of approximately 15 to 25 [35] .
piG0109
Expression of sfGFP is induced when LuxR bound to 3OC6-HSL bind to pLuxR. The cis-repressive element (crR12y) inhibits the translation of sfGFP, since the RBS is blocked by secondary structures of the mRNA. The transcript of the trans-activating element (taR12y) binds to the transcript of the cis-repressive element, hence the RBS is not blocked anymore.

The p15A is present at a copy number of approximately 15 to 25 [35] . PiG0109 is a derivate of piG0065 where the restriction sites EcoRI and XbaI have been removed. Thus, the two constructs slightly differ in the sequence of the 3'-end of the trans-activating element and in the sequence of the 5'-end of the cis-repressive element.
piG0110
Expression of sfGFP is induced when RhlR bound to 4C-HSL bind to pRhlR. The cis-repressive element (crR12) inhibits the translation of sfGFP, since the RBS is blocked by secondary structures of the mRNA. The transcript of the trans-activating element (taR12) binds to the transcript of the cis-repressive element, hence the RBS is not blocked anymore.

The p15A is present at a copy number of approximately 15 to 25 [35] . PiG0110 is a derivate of piG0066 where the restriction sites EcoRI and XbaI have been removed. Thus, the two constructs slightly differ in the sequence of the 3'-end of the trans-activating element and in the sequence of the 5'-end of the cis-repressive element.

The directional terminator BBa_B0015 blocks transcription of sfGFP under the strong constitutive promoter BBa_J23100 . Only if the integrase Bxb1 flips B0015 between the attP and the attB sites, transcription of sfGFP is possible. The pBBR1 origin is present at a copy number of approximately 5, however, the origin is poorly characterized [16]
Integrase Reporter Construct
piG0071
Expression of the integrase Bxb1 and the fluorophore mCherry is induced when LuxR bound to 3OC6-HSL bind to pLuxR. The cis-repressive element (crR12y) inhibits the translation of Bxb1 and mCherry, since the RBS is blocked by secondary structures of the mRNA. The transcript of the trans-activating element (taR12y) binds to the transcript of the cis-repressive element, hence the RBS is not blocked anymore. The two elements build a riboregulator that decreases leakiness of pLuxR. A biologically neutral spacer sequence was designed using the web application R2oDNA [34] . The p15A is present at a copy number of approximately 15 to 25 [35] .
