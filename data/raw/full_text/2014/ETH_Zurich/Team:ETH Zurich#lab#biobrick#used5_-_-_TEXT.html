1 Characterization of two-order crosstalk
1.1 Background information
1.1.1 System considered
1.1.2 Modeling crosstalk
1.2 First-order crosstalk
1.2.1 First Level crosstalk: LasR binds to different HSL and activates the promoter Plas
1.2.2 Second Level crosstalk: LasR binds to 3OC12-HSL, its natural HSL, and activates different promoter
1.3 Second order crosstalk: Combination of both cross-talk levels
