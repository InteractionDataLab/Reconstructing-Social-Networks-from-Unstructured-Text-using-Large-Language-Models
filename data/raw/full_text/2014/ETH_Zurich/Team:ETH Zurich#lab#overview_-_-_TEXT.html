Lab overview
Before combining all the aspects of our project we divided it into several experimental subunits first to answer our crucial questions:
Can we produce a millifluidic PDMS chip with a 3D-printed mold?
Do E. coli cells still grow and produce fluorescent proteins and signal molecules when encapsulated into alginate beads ?
Can the signal diffuse through the channels of the millifluidic chip and activate the cells in the neighboring bead?
Is there crosstalk between the different quorum sensing systems?
Do riboregulators decrease the problem of leakiness?
Are the integrase based logic gates working in our setup?
Click on the different subunits to learn more about how we worked in the lab and what our results were.
