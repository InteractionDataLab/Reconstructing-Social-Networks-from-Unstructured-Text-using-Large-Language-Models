Week 7: Human practice planning, Plasmid assembly running, Logo design
Wednesday, July 9th
We have a logo !
In the lab, we did some :
Plasmid preparation
Sequencing
Digests
Purification of backbone fragments needed for GA
On the modeling side, we tried to estimate integrase parameters from the paper from Bonnet et al. [9] , more particularly with the figure S4 :
Data we are using from the Bonnet et al. [9] paper
We are trying several strategies : minimization of the error function and Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
We have a precise plan for our human practice project. We would like to study the emergence of complexity in many different fields and investigate how people deal with it. We will do this with interviews of experts in different fields, and with a survey for a wider outreach. We will also reach younger people by organizing talks in schools. We will finally give our own advice on the question by writing an essay on the subject and linking it to our experience with Mosaicoli.
