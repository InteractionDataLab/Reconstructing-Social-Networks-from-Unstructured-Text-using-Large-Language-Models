Week 11 : PDMS chip built, First quorum sensing experiment
Wednesday, August 6th
We have a first draft of our abstract.
We have results for our first quorum sensing experiment .
We have now a proper PDMS chip for diffusion experiments.
We have a simple GFP production model for simulation of these quorum sensing experiments.
In the next weeks we will fit quorum sensing parameters thanks to the first quorum sensing experiments and our simple GFP production model, refine this Comsol diffusion model with the right quorum sensing parameters and then fit this diffusion model to diffusion experiments to find the diffusion constant.
