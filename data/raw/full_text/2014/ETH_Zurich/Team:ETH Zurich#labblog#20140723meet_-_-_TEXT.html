Week 9: First simulations, Skype with Paris Bettencourt, Chip fail
Wednesday, July 23rd
We started to simulate diffusion experiments on a Comsol model. We consider cells will lay on agar for the moment.
We will have a chip with these four different channels 1 to 4 mm long. The model still has to be refined because at the moment it doesn't take into account internal/external concentrations of AHL.
Our first mold didn't enable us to peal the PDMS correctly. We have to make it less deep.
5 of 8 regulator plasmids are done. We have to repeat construction of producer plasmids.
Parameter estimation for integrases is not working at the moment.
We skyped with Paris Bettencourt for human practice collaboration and are participating to their newsletter project.
