Discussions with experts
Emergence of complexity can be found in various fields. We can take a crystal as an example: atoms or molecules are arranged in an ordered pattern and this pattern extends in all three dimensions. Each crystal structure is characterised by its unit cell. Thus, from small simple units a complex whole is formed. One of the aims of  our human practice project is to investigate and understand the role of complexity outside our fields of study. What is complexity for a philosopher? Are feelings always complex? How would a city planner describe emergence of complexity? What is the best way to approach complexity in nanosystems? Discussing comparable questions with experts of various professional fields allows us to see complexity from different angles. This gives us novel, inspiring, and interdisciplinary perspective.
