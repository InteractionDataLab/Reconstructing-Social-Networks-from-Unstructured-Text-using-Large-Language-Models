GFP production model for diffusion simulation
Sunday, August 3rd
We need an efficient way to simulate diffusion experiments. A receiver cell at the end of a channel receives AHL produced by the well at the other end of the channel, and starts to produce GFP. By using quasi steady state aproximations (considering that binding is much faster than transcription and diffusion), we have a simple equation for GFP production as a function of AHL :
Equations and approximations for the model of GFP production by sensor cells used in simulation of diffusion and cross-talk experiments
By using producer cells on one side of the channel and receiver cells in the other side, and putting cells in a punched cylinder in agar, we should see fluorescence appear at different times depending on the channel length (1 to 4mm) :
