1 Characterization of two-order crosstalk
1.1 Background information
1.1.1 System considered
1.1.2 Modeling crosstalk
1.2 First-order crosstalk
1.2.1 First Level crosstalk: LuxR binds to different HSL and activates the promoter Plux
1.2.2 Second Level crosstalk: LuxR binds to 3OC6-HSL, its natural HSL, and activates different promoter
1.3 Second order crosstalk: Combination of both cross-talk levels

Characterization of two-order crosstalk
Background information
System considered
Modeling crosstalk
First-order crosstalk
First Level crosstalk: LuxR binds to different HSL and activates the promoter Plux
Second Level crosstalk: LuxR binds to 3OC6-HSL, its natural HSL, and activates different promoter
Second order crosstalk: Combination of both cross-talk levels
Other regulatory proteins, like LuxR, bind to different HSL and activates the promoter.
