Week 14 : Diffusion experiments started, simulated with Comsol, and fitting of quorum sensing dynamics
Monday, August 25th
We carried diffusion experiment with different designs : punched PDMS, liquid, beads. For every design we added high concentrations of pure AHL in the sender well, so cells are glowing a lot. However because of this high concentration, diffusion is very high and at a given AHL concentration, receiving cells are glowing at the same time for all 4 channel lengths. Check the corresponding article for more details.
We have a Comsol simulation for these experiments that explains why at this concentration of AHL (1mM), all 4 wells glow at the same time irrespectively of channel length. Check this article for more details.
We could fit degradation rates of external, internal AHL and GFP thanks to quorum sensing dynamic curves.
Check the corresponding article for more details.
