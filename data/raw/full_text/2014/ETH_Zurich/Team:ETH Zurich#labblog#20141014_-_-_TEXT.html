School Visit
20141014
On Oct 14. 2014 Stefanie and Nadine visited a high school in Bern as a part of our human practice project. There the girls had the chance to teach students at the age of 16-17 years. Through these lectures, we attempted to impart the basic principles of synthetic biology and encouraged the students to participate in a discussion of the concepts presented. In these discussions we tried to focus on risks to humans, health, the environment and the public. Furthermore former iGEM projects were quickly outlined and their possibilities and potential discussed. Thus, we increase the level of awareness of synthetic biology and simultaneously teach them how to approach complex problems. This school visit belongs to the outreach aspect of our human practice project as it aims to share knowledge with the public.
