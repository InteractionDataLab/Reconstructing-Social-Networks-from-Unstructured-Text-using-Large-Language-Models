First millifluidic chip
Thursday, August 2nd
Here is our first millifluidic chip for diffusion experiments ! This time we used a layer of PDMS thin enough so that we could peel it without breaking it. In some wells will be added producer cells or pure AHL, and in the wells on the other side of the channels, receiver cells. There are several lengths of channels, this should enable us to retrieve diffusion parameters by recording when receiver cells start glowing.
