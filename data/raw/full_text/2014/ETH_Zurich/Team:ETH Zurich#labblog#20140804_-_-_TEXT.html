First quorum sensing experiment
Monday, August 4th
We performed double transformations with different combinations of regulator + sensor plasmids for cross-talk experiments. We have results for our first quorum sensing experiment : fluorescence under control of wildtype lux sensor (s24) over time for different concentrations of AHL. s1 is a negative control.
