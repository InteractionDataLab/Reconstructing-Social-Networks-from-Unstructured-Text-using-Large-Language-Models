Week 16 : choosing an AHL pair, improving diffusion
Monday 8th September
We have enough crosstalk results to decide which pair of quorum sensing systems we will use : Las and Lux. See this article for more details.
Diffusion experiment (trying to have a correlation between channel length and time of fluorescence, having cells at the end of a channel and adding pure HSL at the other end of the channel, see this article for more details on the setup) : We tried lower concentrations of pure HSL and the wells start shining at different moments, but we still don't have any correlation between channel length and starting time of fluorescence, because our chip seems to be leaky and some wells dried completely. However, this experiment enables us to check that fluorescence appears after a reasonable time and that channel length probably doesn't influence this time too much.
On the modeling side, we are not able to retrieve diffusion coefficient of HSL from this diffusion experiment but we can use a parameter from literature.
