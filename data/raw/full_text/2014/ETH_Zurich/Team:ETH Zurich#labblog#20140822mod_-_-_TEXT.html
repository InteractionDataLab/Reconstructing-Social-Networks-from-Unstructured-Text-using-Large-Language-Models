Comsol simulation for diffusion experiments
Monday, August 22nd
We have a Comsol simulation for diffusion experiments that explains why at 1mM AHL concentration in sender wells, all 4 wells glow at the same time irrespectively of channel length. On the other hand if we use μ , the wells should start glowing at different times. The channels are 1 to 4mm long. We used a Hill function to model activation of GFP in the receiver wells.
Comsol simulation of diffusion experiments for 1mM and for 1 μM AHL initial concentration in sender wells. It explains why with 1mM all wells start glowing at the same time.
