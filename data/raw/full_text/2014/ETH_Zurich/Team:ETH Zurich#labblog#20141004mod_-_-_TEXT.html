Stochastic model giving insight on parameters
Tuesday, October 4th
We modeled the XOR module with a stochastic model, as the sites are discrete and not continuous and thus binding events might be sensitive to stochasticity. In this process, we figured out that the concentration of GFP was rapidly increasing due to fast flipping rates. It is very unlikely in biological systems. Thus, this model helped us debug an estimated paramter
GFP and LuxI produced when the system is ON.
Both inputs are present. There is an immediate GFP response, followed by degradation.
