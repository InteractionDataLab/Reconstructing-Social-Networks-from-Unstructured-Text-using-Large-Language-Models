Optimizing Restriction Endonuclease Reactions
Digest of 291 and 561
291: (2x)
1μL AscI
1μL FseI
0.5μL PvuI

let solution cool down to approximately 50 °C, add 5 μL peqGREEN, mix
pour solution in tray, use appropriate comb
add 10μL loading dye (6x) to samples
fill samples and ladder (10 μL) in wells
run gel at 135 V for 50min
