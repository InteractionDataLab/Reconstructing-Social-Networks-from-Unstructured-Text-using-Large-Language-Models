Survey
Survey
Our survey deals with complexity. Complexity in everyday life as complexity in biology, the emergence of complexity and the relationship we have to it. How is the idea people have of complexity; what do they associate with it? Are the feelings connected to that idea positive or rather negative? Is a dog actually complex? And what about an atom? Or love? Where do people encounter complexity? How do they react to it; do they face it or is avoiding the strategy of choice? From general questions about complexity we go over to questions directly related to our project; do people see necessity in the investigation of emergence of complex pattern in nature? Are simplifying and mimicking good strategies to approach complexity?
However, before we tell to much about our survey, we invite you to participate:
Right now, the survey can be filled in in English or in German . A French version will follow soon.
For our survey a sample size of 500 people is planned. The sample consists of randomly selected people of all ages, sexes and educational background. In addition other iGEM teams are asked for their participation in our study, so as to obtain a sample of manifold cultural backgrounds. Additionally, we enhance collaboration and promote networking between the teams. Each team that has contributed at least 20 answers to our survey is rewarded with a badge that can be posted on the wiki to show the successful interaction. The answers obtained in this survey are interpreted and summarized in graphic illustrations.
