Modeling overview
Our whole model is the result of separate studies for every module of the system. We started with mass action kinetics to model the reactions of all modules, and chose the proper approximations to fit parameters when they were unknown. The flow of the information is characterized by transfer functions. Click on the different modules to check out their precise characterization. For a global description of the whole cell model as a black box, click on Whole cell model.
