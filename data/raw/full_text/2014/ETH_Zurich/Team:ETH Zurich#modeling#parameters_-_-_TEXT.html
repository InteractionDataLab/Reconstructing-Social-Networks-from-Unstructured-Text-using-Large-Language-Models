Tools
We used the following tools for modelling and simulation:
MATLAB version 8.3.0.532 (R2014a). Natick, Massachusetts: The MathWorks Inc., 2014. for deterministic model, curve fitting (function: fittype ; robustness option: LAR) and parameter estimation.
COMSOL Multiphysics software Version 4.4.0.248, COMSOL Ltd, 2014, for diffusion model and simulation.
MEIGO Toolbox for parameter estimation. [26]
