Week 10: Chip design, Plasmid assembly, Bead production
Wednesday, July 30th
We designed two possibilities for the chip: either cells laying on agar or punched cylinders in the agar.
Comsol simulations of a part of the future chip, in two different designs : droplets of cells laying on the agar or introduced in a punched cylinder in the agar. Cells are producing AHL which diffuses through the channels.
8 out of 21 plasmids were positively sequenced. 7 further plasmids are sent for sequencing.
We will start cross-talk experiments this week. It should help us choose an orthogonal AHL pair among three different quorum sensing systems.
We have started to learn bead production.
