Table 3 Crosstalk matrix for the promoter prhl ( BBa_I14017 )
In this set of experiments the promoter pRhl was tested for potential crosstalk. In the top left position we observe the induction of pRhl by C4-HSL bound to the regulator RhlR . The switching behaviour was observed at a C4-HSL concentration of 1 μM.   In the case of 3OC12-HSL binding the RhlR regulator and subsequently the promoter pRhl insignificant crosstalk has been observed. Severe crosstalk was observed in the case of 3OC6-HSL binding the RhlR regulator followed by induction of pRhl . The transition occurred at a concentration of the inducer molecule of 1 μM but compared to the reference curve a lower value of fluorescence per OD was observed (1000 a.u.). Another case of crosstalk with the pRhl was detected with 3OC12-HSL binding to the corresponding LasR regulator followed by inducing the promoter pRhl . Here switching occurred at a concentration 1 nM of 3OC12-HSL and reached fluorescence per OD of 750 a.u.. This is approximately 0.5 fold the value of the fluorescence per OD shown by the reference curve indicated in green.
