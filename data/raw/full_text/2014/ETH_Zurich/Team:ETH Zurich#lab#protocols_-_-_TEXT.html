NanoDrop 2000, UV-Vis Spectrophotometer
Figure 1 Our NanoDrop spectrophotometer
A Thermo Scientific NanoDrop® 2000 spectrophotometer was used to determine the concentrations of our plasmids after miniprep.
This microvolume spectrophotometer can be used to measure the concentration and purity of DNA, RNA or protein samples. Having a wide spectral range (190-840nm) allows for measuring a variety of samples types such as peptides, DNA, RNA, purified protein and even gold nanoparticles. Even for highly concentrated samples no dilutions are required. Results are obtained in less than 15 seconds from sample pipetting to wiping the pedestal clean. For the measurement only 0.5 – 2uL of the samples are needed. The software with an intuitive user interface allows for classical NanoDrop applications such as nucleic acids, protein A280, colorimetric assays and new user defined custom methods.

Novaspec Plus™ Visible Spectrophotometer
Novaspec™ Plus Visible Spectrophotometer is ideal for general biotech laboratory use. There are stored methods for the standard colorimetric methods of Bradford, BCA, Biuret and Lowry in addition to the basic modes of absorbance, transmittance,OD600 and concentration measurements. The use of diode array technology permits rapid wavelength scans to be made as well and, as there are no moving parts, make for a highly reliable and low maintenance product (Fig 1).  The large backlit display enables the graphical results for wavelength scans, kinetics assays (including slope calculation for rate/activity studies) and standard curves to be viewed (Fig 2).Up to 99 methods for such experiments can be stored for instant recall and use by a laboratory assistant. Novaspec Plusis delivered with Graﬁco, a PC utility software package, and the requisite serial lead, providing the user with the means to capture, print and store data from the instrument (with a time/date stamp) onto a PC so that a results log can be built up or data exported to Microsoft™ Excel.
The cell holder supplied with Novaspec Plus accepts standard 10-mm pathlength glass or plastic cells (adapters are availableto convert it to accept 10-, 12- and 16-mm diameter test tubes).It can be removed for cleaning, or ﬂushed through with water in situ, if spillages occur.  For users who require thermostatting, particularly for kineticsstudies and use with test kits, a special version of Novaspec Plus is available with a factory ﬁtted heated cell holder (37 °C only);note that this cell holder cannot be added retrospectively.

Harvard Pump 11 Plus
Our team used the syringe pump for fabricating the alginate beads containing our bacteria.
Harvard Apparatus’ Syringe Pump 11 Plus combines smoother flow and updated features to create a high performance syringe pump with a basic syringe pump price!
Bright Display and Easy-To-Use Interface  A new, two-line 16 character vacuum fluorescent display and six membrane keys make this a powerful, easy-to-use syringe pump. Only two entries are required to start pumping; Syringe ID and flow rate. The flow rate can be changed while the pump is running.
Two Modes of Operation,  Constant Flow Rate & Volume Dispense  The new Pump 11 Plus will operate continuously in RATE mode or accurately dispense a specific amount of fluid in VOLUME mode.
Versatile  Select from two different models. The standard Pump 11 Plus model has the following features:  • Infusion Only  • End of Travel Limit Stop  • Anti-Siphon Bracket
Non-Volatile Memory  New micro-stepping pump profiles deliver very smooth and consistent flow over the entire flow rate range. These pumps now feature non-volatile memory. The pump remembers its last syringe size, flow rate used and configuration settings. An advanced universal power supply means there is no need to change AC line switches, fuses or wires.

Multi site directed mutagenesis
Single Primer Method
This protocol only uses one oligo per mutation site (cuts the oligo cost in half) and can mutate more than one site at a time. While this protocol is less reliable than the previous protocol (only ~25% of colonies will contain the desired mutation(s)), if you're doing multiple mutations on the same piece of DNA than this can save you many days of work by just sequencing a few more colonies. In this protocol there is an initial Kinase (phosphorylation) reaction to allow your primers to be available for ligation. The polymerase will extend from one primer to another and then the Taq ligase will seal the nick. This allows multiple mutations to be done at the same time.
Method
Design mutagenesis primer(s). The targeted mutation should be in the middle of the primer. Design your primers (including the mutations) to have a Tm >=78°C.

Transform 3μL purified DNA into highly competent cells.
Screen the transformants for the desired mutation using restriction digest or sequencing.
Notes Because the inital kinase step could lead to non-specific binding, it would be best to use a hot-start polymerase for this procedure. Any combination of DMSO and MgSO4 has shown significant improvments in product.
According to Multi Site Directed Mutagenesis, Single Primer Method
Preparation of alginate beads
Harvest bacteria in exponential phase (OD between 1.5 and 2.0)
Centrifuge the culture for 10 min at 4000 rcf
Resuspend and dilute the pellet in sterile NaCl solution (0.9%)
Add bacteria-NaCl-suspension to sterile alginate (2.5%) so as to reach an alginate concentration of 2%
Fill the suspension into a sterile syringe
Use a suitable device for uniform droplet formation
Collect the droplets in a beaker containing CaCl2 (100mM) to allow electrostatic cross-linking within the alginate bead
Store the beads in CaCl2 (10mM)
1 bead corresponds to approximatly 14.5 µl alginate-NaCl
