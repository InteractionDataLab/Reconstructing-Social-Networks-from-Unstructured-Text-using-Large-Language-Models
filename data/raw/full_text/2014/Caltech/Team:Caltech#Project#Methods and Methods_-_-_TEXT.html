PCR
For each 25 μL reaction mixture:
12.5 μL Phusion Mastermix
2.5 μL primer mix (10 μM of forward and reverse primer)
1 μL DNA template
0.75 μL DMSO (optional)
Fill to 25 μL with MilliQ water
Thermal Cycler Protocol
98°C for 30 seconds
98°C for 10 seconds
53°C for 30 seconds
72°C for 15x seconds, where x is the expected length of longest PCR product (in kilobases)
Repeat above steps 29 more times
72°C for 10 minutes
Hold at 4C°
Gel electrophoresis
Making the gel
Make 1% agarose solution in 1x TBE buffer (typically 0.5 g agarose per 50 mL 1x TBE buffer)
Microwave solution for 60-90 seconds, until agarose is completely dissolved
Add 5 μL SYBR Safe per every 50 μL of agarose solution
Pour into gel casket and add comb. Let cool for around 20-30 minutes to allow gel to set
Lane mixtures
For DNA ladders, mix 0.5 μL of ladder, 1 μL loading dye, 4.5 μL MilliQ water
For DNA samples (typically PCR products), mix 2 μL of sample, 1 μL loading dye, 3 μL MilliQ water
Running the gel
Fill gel box with 1x TBE buffer
Load gel, then run at 200V for 20 minutes
Image gel under UV light
Colony PCR
If using colonies grown on plates:
Pick colonies with pipette tip and re-suspend in 10 μL of MilliQ water
If using liquid cultures:
Add 0.5 μL of 5mL liquid culture to 10 μL of MilliQ water
PCR reaction mixture
5 μL Phusion Mastermix
0.5 μL forward primer (10 μM)
0.5 μL reverse primer (10 μM)
4 μL MilliQ water
Make 10x μL of this reaction mixture, where x is the number of colonies picked
For each colony suspension, add 1 μL of the suspension to 10 μL of the PCR reaction mix
Thermal Cycler Protocol
Lid temperature 105°C
98°C for 10 minutes
98°C for 30 seconds
53°C for 15 seconds
72°C for 15x seconds, where x is the expected length of PCR product (in kilobases)
Repeat above steps 29 more times
72°C for 5 minutes
Hold at 4°C
Gibson assembly
Calculate equimolar amounts of each DNA fragment to be used in Gibson assembly. The length of the insert divided by length of the backbone multiplied by the mass of the backbone used (typically 0.5 or 1 ng) gives the mass of insert desired (in ng). Use the concentration of the DNA fragment to determine volume of DNA fragment to be added to the DNA mix. Fill to 2.5 or 5 μL of total DNA mix using MilliQ water
Add 3 times as much Gibson Mastermix as there is DNA mix
Thermal Cycler Protocol
Lid temperature 105C
50°C for 1 hour
Hold at 4°C
Transformations
For JM109 cells:
Add 2 μL of plasmid to 20 μL of cells
Stir with pipette tip
Keep cells on ice for 5-10 minutes
Add 4 volumes of SOC medium and incubate in shaker at 37°C for 1 hour. This step is optional if plating onto CARB.
Plate with glass beads
For DH5α-Z1 cells:
Add 1 μL of plasmid to 40 μL of cells
Incubate on ice for 10 minutes
Heat shock at 42°C for 90 seconds
Add 100 μL of SOC medium, then incubate in a 37°C shaker for 30-90 minutes to recover
Plate with glass beads
Liquid Culture Inoculation
Add 5 μL antibiotic to 5 mL LB media
Pick colony from solid culture with pipette tip and mix into liquid
Incubate in 37°C shaker overnight
PCR purification
Used to purify PCR products of unwanted DNA
Use QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Cat. No. 28107)
Deviation from established protocol: elute in 40 μL EB buffer
Miniprep
Use to extract plasmids from transformed colonies
Use QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Cat. No. 27104)
Deviation from established protocol: elute in 40 μL EB buffer
