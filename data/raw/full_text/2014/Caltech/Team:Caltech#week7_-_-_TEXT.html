Export Systems
Ran colony PCR on pTG002/3/6-transformed JM109 cultures grown up over the weekend. Bad results for all of them
Created and ordered new primers that will hopefully avoid secondary-structure-formation when the exonuclease attacks the 5' end during Gibson assembly.
lamBCDA & fsrABC Reception Systems
Single-transformations run on each of the constructs used in the double-transformations:
pMB001
pMB002
pMB003
pMB004
pMB005
pMB006
agrBCDA Reception System and Combinatorial Promoters
Colonies were picked from pAA008 transformations incubated over the weekend, as well as the pAA009 & pAA010 transformations, which had been set up last Thursday.
Set up liquid cultures of the colonies to grow overnight in preparation for miniprep and sequencing tomorrow
Tuesday, 7/29/14
Export Systems
Ran Gibson assembly products on a gel. Results inconclusive
Started 3 mL liquid cultures of bacteria (with pTG004 & pTG005) with varying levels of aTc induction:
0 nM, 50 nM, 150 nM, 250 nM, 350 nM, & 450 nM
lamBCDA & fsrABC Reception Systems
Colony PCR was run on several of the colonies that emerged from the single-transformations last night
Gel was run, but wrong primers were used. New primers for sequencing/colPCR were ordered, and colPCR will be redone tomorrow.
agrBCDA Reception System and Combinatorial Promoters
Miniprepped liquid cultures grown last night and shipped samples for sequencing.
Wednesday, 7/30/14
Export Systems
Ran new PCR reactions with newly designed primers to extract backbones of pTG002/3/6.
DpnI-digested (4 hrs) and PCR-purified the PCR products.
Products were run on a gel to confirm their creation.
Gibson assembled the backbones with their geneblock inserts
Gibson assemblies were transformed into JM109, which were plated & incubated overnight.
Additionally we began experimentation on the pTG004 (lam system) & pTG005 (fsr system) constructs we had successfully constructed in Week 5, using the liquid cultures induced with aTc yesterday.
Western blots were run on both supernatant and cell lysate samples (6 concentrations of aTc, so 12 Western lanes for each system) from the 2 liquid cultures grown up last night. 3xFLAG-antibodies appear to mark proteins in the fsr supernatant and cell lysate lanes.
agrBCDA Reception System and Combinatorial Promoters
Analyzed sequencing results:
pAA008 successfully constructed
Minipreps supposedly containing pAA009 & pAA010 instead contain pKS001 backbone template
We redid PCR of the pAA009/010 backbone
DpnI digestion for 2 hours, followed by PCR purification. The purified product was then run on a gel.
Thursday, 7/31/14
Export Systems
5 colonies from each of the overnight transformations were picked (15 total), and we ran colony PCR (52°C annealing step) on them using the newly ordered sequencing primers.
colony PCR products were run on a gel, showing that none of them contained the correct construct.
10 new colonies were picked and "colony-PCR-ed" (this time with a 47° annealing step). However, running the product on a gel showed these didn't work either.
lamBCDA & fsrABC Reception Systems
colony PCR was redone on the pMB001-006 transformations using the newly ordered primers. Still no binding.
agrBCDA Reception System and Combinatorial Promoters
agrBCDA system:
We used a gel extraction kit to extract the pAA009/010 backbone from the gel run yesterday.
Combinatorial Promoters:
PCRed the plasmid backbone and combinatorial promoter parts of pAA002.
DpnI digested the PCR products
Ran a gel on the products to confirm sequences were of the correct length
PCR-purified the DpnI-digested products
Friday, 8/1/14
Export Systems
To debug our colony PCRs from yesterday, we set up 8 colony-PCR reactions on a annealing temperature gradient, using E. coli containing pKS001 (the positive control in our earlier colPCRs) as the template.
Annealing temperature was allowed to range from 47°C to 54°C
Optimal annealing temperature for our new sequencing primers was determined to be around 48.6°C, with no binding beyond 52°C.
To create a negative control for our Western blots, we obtained a pTet_GFP plasmid that had been assembled via Golden Braid assembly. This assembly product was transformed into JM109 and plated on a chloramphenicol plate.
We will eventually place a 3xFLAG behind the GFP in this plasmid to be used in a Western.
In preparation for the LCMS run to detect the lam system's signalling peptide, we are going to remove the 3xFLAG from pTG004 (as it would be in any actual signal-reception system involving lam we would design):
3xFLAG was PCRed out (linearizing the pTG004 plasmid) using 2 new primers we had designed with phosphorylated 5' ends. 50°C annealing step was used.
PCR-purified PCR product.
Around-the-horn ligation (to recircularize pTG004-without-FLAG) was run using Quick Ligation kit
Ligation product was transformed into JM109, plated on carbenicillin, and incubated.
Colony PCR (49°C annealing step) was then run on the 3 colonies that grew up.
A gel was run on the colony PCR products, revealing ____
lamBCDA & fsrABC Reception Systems
Still no success with the colony PCR.
agrBCDA Reception System and Combinatorial Promoters
Did a Gibson assembly of pAA002 (containing a combinatorial promoter), pAA009, and pAA010 (containing agr reception system), using PCRed/gel-extracted (respectively) products from yesterday.
