Export Systems
Attempt to create a negative control for Western blotting:
Ran colony PCR on colonies of A2 construct (pTet-GFP). Annealing temperature was 53°C. Colonies were overloaded and smeared the lanes.
Reran colony PCR on A2 colonies. Annealing temperature was 51°C. 2 presumed successes.
Set up 2 liquid cultures using the 2 colonies proposed to have A2.
LCMS analysis of lam system:
Continued vacufuging LCMS acetonitrile pTG004-FLAG samples.
lamBCDA & fsrABC Reception Systems
Miniprepped pMB001, 2, & 5 liquid cultures. Shipped them out for sequencing.
Resuspended colonies for pMB003, 4, & 6 and grew up overnight cultures of them.
agrBCDA Reception System and Combinatorial Promoters
agrBCDA system:
Set up liquid cultures of pAA009 & pAA010 colonies from overnight.
Ran colony PCR on pAA009 & pAA010 colonies, adding DMSO & with annealing temperature of 51°C. This yielded bright bands at correct length for 2 of the pAA010 colonies and some of the pAA009 colonies.
PCR-purified the pAA010 colony PCR products & shipped them for sequencing.
Miniprepped pAA009 liquid cultures & sent samples for sequencing.
Tuesday, 8/12/14
Export Systems
Attempt to create a negative control for Western blotting:
Miniprepped yesterday's 2 liquid cultures of A2 and shipped them for sequencing
LCMS analysis of lam system:
Continued vacufuging LC/MS acetonitrile samples (lam-noFLAG)
agrBCDA Reception System and Combinatorial Promoters
Analyzed sequencing data, indicating that 2 of the pAA010 Gibson colonies contain the correct sequence.
Miniprepped liquid cultures of those colonies.
Since pAA009 construction was a failure, we ran another Gibson assembly constructing pAA009.
New Gibson assemblies were transformed into DH5α-Z1.
Wednesday, 8/13/14
Export Systems
Redo of cloning of agr system and fsr-FLAGafter:
PCRed out backbones for pTG002,  pTG003, & pTG006.
DpnI digested and then purified PCR products.
Ran a gel to confirm isolation of backbones from above procedures.
Gibson assembly using constructed backbones and appropriate gblocks.
Gibson assembly products were transformed into JM109 cells. 2 transformations were performed for each product: one using 3 μL of assembly product and the other using 11 μL of assembly product.
Transformations werew plated on CARB plates & incubated overnight.
Preparation of fsr system for LC/MS analysis:
Innoculated LB-CARB liquid culture with DH5α cells expressing pTG005 (fsr system with FLAG still included)
lamBCDA & fsrABC Reception Systems
Miniprepped pMB003, pMB004, & pMB006 liquid cultures. Sent samples out for sequencing.
Resuspended pMB005 colonies and ran colony PCR.
agrBCDA Reception System and Combinatorial Promoters
Ran colony PCR on colonies from the pAA009 Gibson assembly transformation yesterday.
Ran a gel of the colony PCR products.
PCR-purified promising PCR products and shipped them for sequencing.
Thursday, 8/14/14
Export Systems
Redo of cloning of agr system and fsr-FLAGafter:
Ran colony PCR on yesterday's transformations.
Colony PCR products were run on a gel.
8 LB-CARB liquid cultures were prepared and incubated overnight.
Attempt to create a negative control for Western blotting:
Picked more colonies from A2 transformation last week and ran colony PCR on them.
Ran a gel on the colony PCR products.
Set up 4 LB-CARB liquid cultures and incubated them overnight.
Preparation of fsr system for LC/MS analysis:
Set up 0 nM, 250 nM, & 500 nM aTc inductions of pTG005-expressing cells (fsr-FLAG) in MOPS media. 5 μL aliquots of last night's liquid culture was used to start the cultures in MOPS.
lamBCDA & fsrABC Reception Systems
agrBCDA Reception System and Combinatorial Promoters
Analyzed sequencing results from yesterday. Bad results for all.
Some colonies that produced bands of right length from yesterday's colPCR weren't sequenced, so those colonies were miniprepped and then shipped for sequencing.
Friday, 8/15/14
Export Systems
Redo of cloning of agr system and fsr-FLAGafter:
Miniprepped 3 of the 8 LB liquid cultures from last night.
Shipped samples out for sequencing.
Attempt to create a negative control for Western blotting:
Miniprepped 3 of the 4 LB liquid cultures from last night.
Shipped samples out for sequencing.
Preparation of fsr system for LC/MS analysis:
Started LB liquid culture of DH5α cells expressing pAA001 as a negative control in the LC/MS runs.
aTc-induced MOPS liquid cultures from yesterday were spun down, and then the supernatant was loaded into C18 columns, washed with 10% acetonitrile, and then eluted with 60% acetonitrile.
The pTG005 acetonitrile elutates were then left to evaporate in the fume hood overnight.
On Saturday, we began vacufuging the fsr-FLAG LC/MS acetonitrile samples.
On Saturday, we also set up 0 nM, 250 nM, & 500 nM aTc inductions of pAA001-expressing cells (negative control in LC/MS) in MOPS media. 5 μL aliquots of last night's liquid culture was used to start the cultures.
On Sunday, we spun down the aTc-induced MOPS liquid cultures of pAA001 cells, and then loaded the supernatant into C18 columns, washed it with 10% acetonitirle, and then eluted it with 60% acetonitrile.
pAA001 acetonitrile samples were then left to evaporate in the fume hood overnight.
De-FLAGging pTG005:
Attempted to PCR-out the 3xFLAG from pTG005.
DpnI digested and PCR-purified the pTG005 PCR product.
Ran round-the-horn ligation on the purified PCR product.
Transformed round-the-horn ligation product into DH5α
lamBCDA & fsrABC Reception Systems
agrBCDA Reception System and Combinatorial Promoters
Analyzed sequencing results from yesterday's minipreps. Failed again.
Conducted Round-the-horn PCR using sequence-verified pAA010 plasmids to attempt to construct pAA009.
DpnI-digested for 1.5 hours and then PCR-purified PCR products.
QuickLigation reaction on purified PCR product. Ligation product was then transformed into JM109.
