Export Systems
Redo of cloning of agr system:
Ran colony PCR on 10 picked overnight colonies.
colony PCR products were then run on a gel.
5 LB-CARB liquid cultures were set up and incubated overnight.
De-FLAGging pTG005 for LC/MS analysis:
Ran colony PCR on 10 picked overnight colonies.
colony PCR products were then run on a gel.
3 LB-CARB liquid cultures were set up and incubated overnight.

Export Systems
Redo of cloning of agr system:
Miniprepped the 5 liquid cultures from yesterday. Stored the plasmids in the fridge.
De-FLAGging pTG005 for LC/MS analysis:
Miniprepped the 3 liquid cultures from yesterday. Stored the plasmids in the fridge.

Ran colony PCR using liquid cultures of Gibson colonies inoculated on Friday, in hopes of obtaining clearer gel results
Wednesday, 9/3/14
Export Systems
Shipped samples for both agr-recloning subproject (2*5=10 samples) & pTG005-unFLAGging subproject (2*3=6 samples) out for sequencing.

agrBCDA Reception System and Combinatorial Promoters
Ran gel of colony PCR products from yesterday
Gel still yielded unfavorable results
Planning to clone using Golden Gate assembly
