Picked 10 Gibson colonies from yesterday
Ran colony PCR on re-suspended colonies, inoculated liquid cultures of picked colonies
Ran gel of colony PCR products, but no good bands were obtained
Saturday, 8/30/14
Export Systems
Redo of cloning of agr system:
Ran PCR reactions to construct appropriate backbone for pTG002 & modified gblock insert for pTG002.
DpnI digested PCR product for pTG002 backbone.
PCR purified DpnI digested pTG002 backbone and pTG002 modified gblock insert PCR products.
Ran purified products on a gel.
Ran Gibson assembly reaction between pTG002-backbone & pTG002-insert.
Transformed Gibson reaction mix into JM109. Cells were then plated & incubated overnight.
De-FLAGging pTG005 for LC/MS analysis:
Ran PCR reaction to exclude 3xFLAG from pTG005.
Ran DpnI digest and then PCR purification on PCR product.
Ran PCR product on a gel to verify creation of the appropriate DNA fragment.
Ran a round-the-horn ligation reaction on the purified PCR product.
Transformed the reaction mix into JM109. Cells were then plated & incubated overnight.
