To figure out what went wrong during assembly of the combinatorial promoter constructs used in last week's TXTL workshop, we attempted to take out the LacI and TetR genes present in plasmids pAA001.
PCR extraction of linear fragments of pAA001 minus the lacI and tetR genes.
Recircularization of the truncated "backbone"+"combinatorial promoter construct" round-the-horn ligation
Transformation of recircularized plasmids into JM109 competent cells
Cells plated onto carbenicillin plates and incubated at 37°C overnight
In other news, we continued to work on the wiki and make it worse and worse......
