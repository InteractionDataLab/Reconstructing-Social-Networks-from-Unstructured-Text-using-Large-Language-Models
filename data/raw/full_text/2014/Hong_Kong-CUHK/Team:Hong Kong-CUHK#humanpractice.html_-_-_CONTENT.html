The event “Energy Day” is held by Faculty of Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong on August 20th, 2014.Hundreds of participants, including professors, researchers and experts from related industries were involved.This activity aimed to promote new technology in energy aspect, which was highly related to the goal of our project. We had a whole-day poster session, in which we present our project to various audiences. Our project aims at turning excess carbon dioxide in atmosphere to useful biofuel, methane. It was a wonderful opportunity to promote our project and also receive professional comments, which are discussed in our questionnaire analysis. Apart from sharing our project, we also introduce iGEM and synthetic biology, which has aroused a great interest among the visitors. They were amazed by the concept and the application of synthetic biology, and realized the underlying industrial value. Indeed, synthetic biology could make significant contributions in energy-related fields. We were glad to share our enthusiasm on this topic with others and also inspired them for further research and application. “Energy Day” has successfully raised the awareness of professionals towards synthetic biology and a novel environmental friendly way to generate biofuel.

In order to introduce the idea of synthetic biology and iGEM to high school students, we have done multiple speeches in Hong Kong. We aim to educate the young students about the creativity and potential of synthetic biology, a booming, novel topic which is not covered in their curriculum. We hope to arouse their interest and hopefully inspire them to join iGEM too. Currently, no Hong Kong team participates in HS iGEM competition. Encouraging high school students to join iGEM is crucial and exciting, as iGEMers, we believe it is our responsibility to play an active role. To demonstrate the unlimited applications of synthetic biology, we shared innovative award-winning projects in the past iGEM competitions. We also discussed our current project with them, eager to know their comments. Results from surveys provided us different insights into our projects, which were highly-valued.  After the talks, many students approached us and asked us further details about iGEM and synthetic biology. It is truly rewarding to see so many students are interested and inspired. We hope Hong Kong HS iGEM teams can be seen in the near future, producing more novel ideas.

As synthetic biology involves more specific equipment and advance skills, most of the high school students do not have chance of having real laboratory experience. We hope to provide some basic introduction of common equipments and techniques to the students. By holding laboratory workshops, we offer the students a hand-on experience of doing experience. We held a workshop to 10 students. Handbooks containing relevant experimental design, background knowledge and protocols were distributed. Experiments such as gel electrophoresis, plasmid DNA extraction…etc, are introduced. In addition, we gave pre-lab talks, emphasizing on safety issue and waste disposal. It is our belief that proper attitudes and manner go before skill. Throughout the workshop, each student got to handle their own experiments, with our guidance and support by the side. Needless to say, most of the participants were thrilled and eager to learn more about other lab techniques. Laboratory workshop gave a great interactive experience between the high school students and our team.

In the event, we opened a booth to promote both iGEM and our project. Pull-up banners introducing synthetic biology and our projects were set up. Poster presentation provided us an opportunity to interact with CUHK students from all disciplines, sharing our project and promote iGEM. Since we decorated our booth with photos from lab, many non-science students were attracted by those apparatus and machines and thus stop by. Besides the posters, we also produced and distributed leaflets, which give more detailed information helping people to understand more. This event was also a great chance for us to recruit iGEM team for the next year. We kept the contacts of those interested students and will send out invitations for recruitment soon. Overall, this event was successful in introducing iGEM and synthetic biology. We hope the seed we planted will give us more potential iGEMers.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="CUHK_Information_Day">CUHK Information Day</SPAN></H2><P>Information day is a University event open to the public. It aims to introduce all the university programmes to high school students. In the hope of encouraging establishment of High School iGEM teams in Hong Kong, we also participate in this event, promoting iGEM and our project. Visitors asked us all kinds of questions, regarding to synthetic biology or genetics engineering. It was also a chance for us to learn how the public understand and view related projects. We treat this issue seriously as we think that publics must know as much as possible before applications based on synthetic biology. It is crucial for the public to gain accurate knowledge and not be affected by some biased media reports. In addition, many high school students were quite interested and we offered to help if they plan to form a HS iGEM team in the future. We hope the idea of iGEM and synthetic biology would be more wide-spread in Hong Kong, particularly among the young students.
