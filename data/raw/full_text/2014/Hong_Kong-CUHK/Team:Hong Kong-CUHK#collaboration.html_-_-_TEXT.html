From 2014.igem.org
Collaboration
We helped Berlin team with their wiki and shared experiences of iGEM and  They sent us some information cornering magnetosome.
We helped City University of Hong Kong to clone a construct that they fail many times. As they use competent E. coli strain BL21 to make the plasmid before, we try to use DH5alpha as an alternative, eventually we successfully help them to clone with it, which is a better strain for plasmid constructing and they helped us to improve our modeling part.
We discussed the progress and exchanged some ideas of synthetic biology and iGEM with Hong Kong University of Science and Technology
