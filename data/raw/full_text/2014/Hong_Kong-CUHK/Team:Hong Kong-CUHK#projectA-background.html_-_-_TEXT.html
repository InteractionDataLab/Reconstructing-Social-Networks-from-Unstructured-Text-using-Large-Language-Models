Why Azotobacter Vinelandii?
Although Azotobacter Vinelandii is not commonly used as a model of gram-negative bacteria, there are many features that make us introduce the chassis to iGEM. We think that it is very suitable for genetic engineering based on the features below:
Anaerobic intracellular environment in aerobic extracellular environment which could use to express oxygen sensitive protein
Most parts in registry optimized for E. coli may also function
Can use stable genome integration which could transform a larger size of gene at once
Antibiotic such as ampicillin and kanamycin can be used
For introducing the stable genome integration, we constructs several biobricks. Moreover, as many promoter of registry cannot be used in Azotobacter Vinelandii, we introduce a novel T7 dependent system using nifH promote. Features about the protein expression system:<p>
Nitrogen inducible—repressed by ammonia and other nitrogen source
Predicted to express better than the original T7 expression system
Make T7 promoter usable in Azotobacter Vinelandii, and hence, make a lot more biobricks could be used in Azotobacter Vinelandii.
