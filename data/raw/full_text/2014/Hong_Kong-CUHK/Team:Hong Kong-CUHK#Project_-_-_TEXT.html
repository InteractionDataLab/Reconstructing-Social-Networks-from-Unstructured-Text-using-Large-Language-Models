Project Description
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is notorious for its major contribution to global warming, where one of the impacts brought to the ecosystem is its excessive solvation into the ocean in carbonate form, threatening marine life [1]. This year we would like to utilize and recharge these abundantly available CO2 by converting to methane (CH4), an important carbon source for fuel and bio-degradable plastic production. While there are naturally existing methane-generating microorganisms, the convertion involves multi-step metabolic reactions, not to mention that they can only survive in anaerobic environment thus diffcult to manipulate.
 
A recent research showed that a mutated form of nitrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii, a nitrogen-fixing bacteria found in soil, has carbon fixation ability [2]. Yang et al. [3] demonstrated that by introducing 70Ala and 195Gln mutations on nitrogenase alpha subunit, the nitrogenase enzyme complex reduced CO2 and CO3- to CH4 instead of converting nitrogen to ammonia. This system provided a one-step reaction to convert CO2 into CH4 and other carbon compounds directly. However, since a large electron flux, thus energy, was wasted in producing molecular hydrogen (H2) from proton during the reaction, we utilized a soluble hydrogenase complex from Aquifex aeolicus to recycle H2 to proton. To further enhance the efficiency of carbon fixation process, we physically linked both nitrogenase and hydrogenase complexes with SH3 and PDZ ligand-domain pairs to accelerate the H2 recycling.
 
To allow regulation of expression of these enzymes in A. vinelandii, we plan to build a T7 protein expression system in this diazotrophic bacteria. Given that this organism produces more nitrogenase complex, which includes the structural gene nifH, in the absence of ammonia [4], we utilized its strong nitrogen-derepressible nifH promoter [4] to control T7 RNA polymerase expression. nifH promoter appeared to be stronger than its counterpart, lacUV5 promoter, in E. coli ([5] and characterization data of iGEM Biobrick K568003 ). Our system may provide an alternative platform for protein expression, as it is compatible to existing T7 promoter-driven constructs. Expression of enzymes along a particular metabolic pathway becomes possible as stable genome integration of DNA up to several MBps could be done in A. vinelandii [6]. Moreover, we only need ammonia to repress the expression instead of using expensive IPTG in the counterpart, thus lowering the expense.
 
To sum up, two goals will be achieved: to create a carbon fixation system using a combination of bacterial nitrogenase and hydrogenase enzyme complexes to convert CO2 to CH4, and to develop a novel nitrogen-regulated T7 protein expression system.

Conclusions
It's important for teams to describe all the creativity that goes into an iGEM project, along with all the great ideas your team will come up with over the course of your work.
It's also important to clearly describe your achievements so that judges will know what you tried to do and where you succeeded. Please write your project page such that what you achieved is easy to distinguish from what you attempted.
