Your Training
Have your team members received any safety training yet?
Yes, we have already received safety training.
Please briefly describe the topics that you learned about (or will learn about) in your safety training.
We have received Biosafety courses on:
Safety laws and policy
Fire safety and emergency procedures
Electrical safety
Safety information resources including MSDS
Chemical handling requirements and waste disposal procedures
Use of personal protective equipment
Practicing safe science
Use of fume cupboards
Principle of Biological Safety
Risk Group and Biosafety Level
Laboratory Practices
Bioaerosol
Biosafety Cabinet
Sterilization
Biowastes
Genetically Manipulated Organisms
In detail, regarding Biological and Related Safety, we have learned:
Risk-Grouping of Micro-organisms by Type
Biosafety Levels
Abbreviated Laboratory Biosafety Level Criteria
Handling Blood and Other "Products" of Human Origin
Biosafety Cabinets
Hazards from "Microbial" Aerosols
Work with Recombinant DNA
Treatment of Biological Waste and Spill Cleanup
Autoclave Safety and Disinfection
Clinical Waste Disposal
Please give a link to the laboratory safety training requirements of your institution (college, university, community lab, etc). Or, if you cannot give a link, briefly describe the requirements.

Your Local Rules and Regulations
Who is responsible for biological safety at your institution? (You might have an Institutional Biosafety Committee, an Office of Environmental Health and Safety, a single Biosafety Officer, or some other arrangement.) Have you discussed your project with them? Describe any concerns they raised, and any changes you made in your project based on your discussion.
Mr. YIP Sung Tat from the University Safety Office of the Chinese University of Hong Kong is one of the persons responsible for biological safety at our institution.
The University Safety Office have done a regular safety check of the lab on 7/3/2014 and the rectification has been carried out by department.
We discussed our project with university safety office every year, for evaluation of the project safety issue.
What are the biosafety guidelines of your institution? Please give a link to these guidelines, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.

In your country, what are the regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories? Please give a link to these regulations, or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.

Risks of Your Project Now
Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab
The organisms that we handle are all from Risk group 1, which are in low risk - generally do not cause disease in healthy adult humans. There should not be any severe risks if all steps are handled properly according to biological safety guidelines. On the other hand, there may be risks if the biological waste and spill are not treated properly, or if the recombinant DNA steps are not handled properly.
Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab)
As the organisms that we handle are in Risk group 1, and both Azotobacter and E. coli exist in natural environment, they will not give high risk to general public even if escaping from our lab. The modified protein system in our project is only dealing with common gas in atmosphere, such as CO2, H2, and CH4. So far as we planned, the production amount is far from sufficient to cause public danger.
Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab)
As the organisms that we handle are in Risk group 1, and both Azotobacter and E. coli exist in natural environment, they will not give high risk to natural environment even if escaping from our lab. The modified protein system in our project is only dealing with common gas in atmosphere, such as CO2, H2, and CH4. So far as we planned, the production amount is far from sufficient to cause environmental.
Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries
Our project does not bear high risk to be maliciously mis-used by individuals, groups or countries, as it does not have any direct threat to human-being and human society.
What measures are you taking to reduce these risks?
We ensure that every member of the team has finished the lab safety training course before entering the lab. Teammates have been trained on proper handling of biological and chemical materials before doing lab work alone. In the lab, personal protective equipments (PPEs) are advised to wear according to requirement. Biological and chemical wastes are disposed properly according o guidelines, respectively. We have considered the safety issue when choosing organisms to use. Also, we communicate with supervisors during regular lab meetings, or whenever a problem comes into our concern.
Risks of Your Project in the Future
What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
As far as we foresee, there will not be any severe new risks arising from the project's growth. Our project does not have any severe direct risk towards lab workers, general public, environment and malicious mis-uses.
Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
We designed certain promoters to regulate the protein expressions of our system. In the future, some self-control system design can be integrated in our project to help control the death of manipulated organism and the expression level of our system.
