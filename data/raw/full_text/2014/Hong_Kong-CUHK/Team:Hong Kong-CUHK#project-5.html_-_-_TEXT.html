From 2014.igem.org
Further direction
The project is done little as the gene sequence of hydrogenase and nitrogenase cluster are of very long sequence (about 30kb in total). Following the failure with Gibson assembly for many times, the cluster is difficult to be made. Up to the time of wiki deadline, the hydrogenase and nitrogenase cluster is not finished. Lengthening the overlapping base pairs of Gibson assembly and other techniques such as overlapping pcr or synthesis may be an alternative way for finishing the project.
