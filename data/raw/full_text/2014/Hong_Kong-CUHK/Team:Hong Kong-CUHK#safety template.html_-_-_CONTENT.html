                        The organisms that we handle are all from Risk group 1, which are in low risk - generally do not cause disease in healthy adult humans. There should not be any severe risks if all steps are handled properly according to biological safety guidelines. On the other hand, there may be risks if the biological waste and spill are not treated properly, or if the recombinant DNA steps are not handled properly.

                        As the organisms that we handle are in Risk group 1, and both Azotobacter and E. coli exist in natural environment, they will not give high risk to general public even if escaping from our lab. The modified protein system in our project is only dealing with common gas in atmosphere, such as CO<SUB>2</SUB>, H<SUB>2</SUB>, and CH<SUB>4</SUB>. So far as we planned, the production amount is far from sufficient to cause public danger.

                        Our project does not bear high risk to be maliciously mis-used by individuals, groups or countries, as it does not have any direct threat to human-being and human society.
                    </DIV><DIV id="subgroup-how-to-reduce" class="subgroup well"><H4>What measures are you taking to reduce these risks?</H4>
                        We ensure that every member of the team has finished the lab safety training course before entering the lab. Teammates have been trained on proper handling of biological and chemical materials before doing lab work alone. In the lab, personal protective equipments (PPEs) are advised to wear according to requirement. Biological and chemical wastes are disposed properly according o guidelines, respectively. We have considered the safety issue when choosing organisms to use. Also, we communicate with supervisors during regular lab meetings, or whenever a problem comes into our concern.

(Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?</H4>
                        As far as we foresee, there will not be any severe new risks arising from the project's growth. Our project does not have any severe direct risk towards lab workers, general public, environment and malicious mis-uses.

Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.</H4>
                        We designed certain promoters to regulate the protein expressions of our system. In the future, some self-control system design can be integrated in our project to help control the death of manipulated organism and the expression level of our system.
