Safety
Prior to bench work of the project, our team members received all basic trainings on biosafety and laboratory safety. Safety training included many aspects, such as the proper usage of all the equipment and discard of experimental rubbish. We also paid special attention to limiting Ethidium Bromide contamination and using nontoxic bacteria.
