Our Team
Tsinghua-A first entered the iGEM Jamboree in 2011 and progresses have been made ever since then. With instructors and team members from the Department of Automation, we have an advantage in modeling construction. We have team members from all kinds of departments, School of Life Science, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences and Department of Automation. Hopefully we can do better this year.
Instructors
Our instructors come from Bioinformatics Division & Center of Synthetic and Systems Biology, TNLIST in Tsinghua University.

Xinye Wang | Undergrad
Hi, everyone~ I am a girl from medical school and always insists on healthy lifestyle. However, I have stay up late for iGEM recently. I guess tomorrow my anatomy teacher will give his advice about health again~
Zhanhao Peng | Undergrad
If you ask me which one do I prefer, coding or iGEM modeling? I will definitely say iGEM modeling.
Luning Yang | Undergrad
I’m so lucky to be in the Tsinghua-A team and I love this iGEM Jamboree. In the last whole year, I spared no effort to the lab work. It is so cool I have the chance to meet with all the youngest synthetic biologists in the world and all those craziest ideas. It is an unforgettable experience for sure~~
Chumeng Xu | Undergrad
As one of the team members from computational background, I was supposed to do most of the "geek" stuff. However, I have dealt with people a lot more than code through this amazing experience :D. Interdisciplinary subjects are all about communication and collaboration. Looking forward to meeting all the fantastic young minds!
Yuehan Wang | Undergrad
hi~I am Wang Yuehan from the Department of Automation. Swimming and accappella are my favorite freetime activities and I believe it's amazing to meet friends from different countries with same interest.(hu~~3 sentences of self-introduction is so hard =.=）
Fei Xia | Undergrad
I am a geek from Department of Automation. I love coding and all such kind of stuffs. IGEM is interesting because it is like hacking into life. Doing the modelling of our iGEM project is an highlight in my years of coding, and I enjoy it a lot.
Yao Xiao | Undergrad
I major in clinical medicine, and wet lab experiment is my first approach to putting hands on problems without a definitely right answer. Those months and years I've spent with E.coli and yeast have brought me a deeper understanding of research.
Minzhen Yi | Undergrad
Hi，everybody~Happy to meet you in iGem! I'm Minzhen Yi in THU, or you can call me hazelnut as my nickname! I'm a girl from the department of Automation, and I hope what I do will not create artificial intelligence which is so perfectly automatic that leaves me nothing to do~
Jie Li | Undergrad
iGEM arouse my primal interest in synthetic biology. Honestly, I’ve gained far more than I’ve ever paid. Hope to meet the sharp minds in iGEM Jamboree!
Huarui Liu | Undergrad
Hi, I amd Huarui Liu from the Department of Automation. I am a tall boy always with smile on my face. I love iGEM so much and entering the jamboree may be the best choice I have ever made.

The students in the Tsinghua-A team came up from different major. We took courses together and had special training in synthetic biology and bioinformatics. All of the designs, constructs, and experiments presented in Tsinghua-A’s Wiki were performed by students of the 2014 Tsinghua-A team. The instructors and teaching assistance were providing feedback and advice. We are proud of completing the project on ourselves.
