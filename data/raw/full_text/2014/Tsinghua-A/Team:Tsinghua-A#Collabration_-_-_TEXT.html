Help Nanjing-China with the Modeling
https://2014.igem.org/Team:Nanjing-China/policy
From July 15 to 18, team member from the Nanjing-China visited us in Beijing. During the three-day stay here, we discussed about our ideas about our projects and team management. Tsinghua-A team members majored in automation gave a warm welcome to them and gave them pieces of advice in their circuit modeling. We showed them the basic idea of modeling and how to do it with MATLAB. The discussion ended with good results and we had a lot of fun as well.
Our team members (Tsinghua-A) are showing them (Nanjing-China) the basic function of MATLAB in circuit modeling.

Help SJTU-BioX-Shanghai with the TALE Expression in Prokaryotic Cells
https://2014.igem.org/Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai
Team member of SJTU-BioX-Shanghai visited our iGEM team in the summer vacation. After we both introduced our project to each other, they felt interested in our project and asked about more details. They needed to express the TALE protein in their project in prokaryotic cells which was exactly what we were doing in our project. After the short meeting, their team leader showed great interests in our projects and we had a nice chat through the Internet. We exchanged our ideas about how to improve their project.
We are having a discussion on SJTU-BioX-Shanghai's project.

Seminar with Tsinghua iGEM team
https://2014.igem.org/Team:Tsinghua
In collaboration with our buddy team, Tsinghua, our team and automation SAST (student association of science and technology) held a seminar among Tsinghua undergraduates. We told the story of iGEM, our projects and the attractions and beauty about synthetic biology.

Newsletter
Join in the Newsletter confounded by Paris Bettencourt iGEM team and Xiamen University iGEM team from the second issue to the last issue. In the Newsletter, we updated our project process and introduce our team members to others. We also gave ‘peer’ review to other iGEM team and gained feedback from others. We enjoyed the process reaching out to other teams, asking for advice and talking about ideas. In the newsletter, the young, ambitious and creative synthetic biologist got together and had fun with the scientific research.
