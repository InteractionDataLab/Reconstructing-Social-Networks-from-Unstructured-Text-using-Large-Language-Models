TEAM PROFILE
ATTRIBUTIONS
Everyone's effort should be honored and repect.
No one work alone as a team. One of the iGEM's charm is to work as a team, to move as a team, to exprience the joy and saddness as a team.Therefore,we grow up from this experience and start to understand the meaning of cooperation in a science study. With this chance to present in our wiki, we shall give our best thanks to who helps us，who teaches us, but also most importantly who always stands just besides us.
