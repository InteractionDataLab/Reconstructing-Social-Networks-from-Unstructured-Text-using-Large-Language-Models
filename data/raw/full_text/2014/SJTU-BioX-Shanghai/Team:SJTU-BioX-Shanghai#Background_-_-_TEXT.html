Background：
Enzymes which form an enzyme system are needed to participate in some complex metabolic pathways. As a result, they tend to form a complex to significatelly raise the reaction efficiency by increasing enzyme-substrate contact. However, in practical application fields such as industry and environment, enzymes we directly use can not form a multi-enzyme complex on most occasions. With the help of artificial multi-enzyme complex systems, we expect to realize polymerization and improve the dynamic characteristics of metabolic reactions.
