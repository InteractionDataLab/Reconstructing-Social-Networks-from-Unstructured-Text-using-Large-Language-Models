Yaojin Sun
I am taking responsibility of team management and modeling work. For the past eleven months, We has experienced laugh, argument, enjoy and improvement. One thing that never change is my trust to my teammates, to our project, to our dream. I will always be with my team, moving forward without fear.
I come from School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, majoring in bioengineering. I’m mainly in charge of enzyme polymerization verification and help with TAL construction as well. I love the science lab, because that’s where I meet true friends. Hope we can all have a great time in MIT!
