Hi, everyone!
There is a Chinese song named
"Unity is the strength."
This year, we want to explore this great power.
Of course, we are not talking about ourselves.
The main characters are...
Enzymes!!
Do you know that the more enzymes polymerize,
the more useful they become?
Enzymes couldn't get close to each others easily.
Therefore,
we help them using a structure we call
"Crown"
to connect them together.
That's not all.
We try to improve our idea by taking
Polymerization
and
Selectivity
into account.
Oops, am I talking too much?
Alright, I will just let you figure out by yourselves.
At last, thanks for reading our wiki~
Want to have a quick view?
