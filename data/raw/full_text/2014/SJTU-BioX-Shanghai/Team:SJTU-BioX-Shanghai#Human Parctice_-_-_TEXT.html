Human Practice
This year, our main focus about human practice is communication. We truly believe that it is the key to bringing dynamic and new ideas to our iGEM community. And it is our job to observe others’ opinions as well as to give others advice. Therefore, this is not only our human practice presentation but also proof for the friendship between our team and all the groups or individuals below.
2014/4/12-SJTU Aniversary Carnival
We first focused on our own school community. After all these years of support from the university, we really wanted to bring fun activities to help everyone learn the beauty of life and synthetic biology.
In April, with the opportunity of School Anniversary Carnival, we designed games about gene codes and biology lab equipment for people to participate in. Over 100 people stepped in our tent and enjoyed their time with us.
2014 Summer Vacation-Shenzhen Foreign Languages School
This year we were also lucky to have younger iGEMers’ companion. SFLS iGEM Team has recently become an official partner of our team. Our cooperation mainly contains two parts. Based on same focus on membrane, Shenzhen_SFLS Lvdagunr project of 2014 iGEM HS utilized the LGT membrane protein Biobricks BBa_K771107 and BBa_K771102 which was submitted by 2012 SJTU-BioX-Shanghai.  Also, one of their teammate, Zhang Yuyin, came to our lab to help out. With the summer visit, we had a lot to share with each other considering the same interest.
2014/8/3~8/7-The 2014 iGEM Formosa in NCTU
During August 3rd to 7th 2014, 7 of our team members attended the 2014 iGem Formosa in NCTU.
Over 20 team presented their idea with speeches and posters. We were excited to have a chance to improve our ideas and presentation by really participating in one. Posters and presentations were made to introduce every team’s project design and progress; questions were raised as well as good advices. Everyone attended really touched the thrill of iGemer’s happiness, and got home fully load. We also enjoyed serious conversations about ideas as well as just a quick chat about the team itself. Especially, we are really thankful to the host school. Only with their thoughtful arrangement could we enjoy this great iGEM event.
2014/8/14~8/15-Software and Modeling track in USTC
On August 14th, we attended the meetup for software track in USTC. Seven software teams attended this meetup including SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, SJTU-Software, SYSU-Software, USTC_Software, HFUT_CHINA, NEAU_Harbin and USTC-China. It was very interesting to see the perspective of software team involved in this event. And as potential users of those software, we were glad to give our opinions to help them improve their user experience. Also, we were grateful to have professors from USTC and Haiyan Liu of the committee attend this meetup and give critiques about the presentation.
2014/4/19-The mini meeting in Tongji University
On 19th April, we went to Tongji University to have a mini iGEM communication meeting. During the meeting, we introduced iGEM competition and synthetic biology, shared our experience in team management, and discussed some of last year's iGEM projects. We are looking forward for this new shining team to rise up.
2014/8/20- Hosting Peking iGEM Team
On 20th August, Peking iGEM team came to our school. With the small group of people, we talked about not only project but also a great blueprint of biology. In feedback, we sent one of our teammates to their discussion afterwards.
