ATTRIBUTIONS
Bronze
We achieved the following 6 goals:
We completed our team registration.
We completed our judging form.
We uploaded our team Wiki.
We will present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree during the conference.
We describe our project CROWN clearly ,including distinguish attribute work done by team members and advisors, instructors.
We submitted BioBrick Part used in our project to the iGEM Registry.
Silver
In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, we achieved the following 4 goals:
We validate 25 new BioBrick Parts during our experiment.
We documented the characterizations of the parts in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
We submitted these new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry and the submissions adhered to the iGEM Registry guidelines.
Our iGEM projects involve important questions related to resource and environment problems like petroleum degradation. We focus on the improvement of enzyme utilization efficiency, and described how our team considered the question within our project.
Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, we achieved the following 3 requirements:
We improve the function and characterization of an existing BioBrick Part in the project of Freiburg 2012 and entered this information in the Registry. We provide new ideas and broaden the range of application upon the former BioBrick by modified the basic units of them.
We cooperated with SJTU-software by debugging constructs.
Our iGEM projects involve important questions related to resource and environment problems like petroleum degradation. We achieved protein polymerization with the help of TAL effector and described thoroughly in our wiki about this approach which can address the questions. Our approach is convenient and easy-used to other scientific researches within and beyond iGEM, including industrial royalties. The approach allowed us to answer our question and influenced deeply through the whole scientific project.
