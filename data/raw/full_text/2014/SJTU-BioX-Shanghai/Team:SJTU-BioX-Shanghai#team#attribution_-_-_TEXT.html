We sincerely thank for all the help given by the research institute of Bio-X. During the whole preparation procedure of the igem competition, Bio-X offered us a great support in all aspects. Thanks to their providing of experimental funds and drugs. Thanks to our supervisor Gang Ma, the professor of Bio-X who supported us with a good experimental condition. Thanks to our instructor Yushu Wang, who spent a lot of time and energy on us, we fought together dealing with all of the hard problems. Without their help and encouragement, we can not held up to the end. And we also give thanks to all other teachers and fellow students who supported us in either experiment or brainstorming in Bio-X. Our whole project is mostly based on their understanding and help!
