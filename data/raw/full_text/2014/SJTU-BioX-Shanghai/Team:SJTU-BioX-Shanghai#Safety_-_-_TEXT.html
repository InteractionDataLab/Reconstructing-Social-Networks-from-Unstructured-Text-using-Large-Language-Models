1. Your Training
a)Have your team members received any safety training yet?
Yes, we have already received safety training.
b)Please briefly describe the topics that you learned about(or will learn about)in your safety training.
Our fundamental training has covered the recognition of risky chemicals and certain experimental conditions, and the biosafety lessons are the first and vital classes for all teammates. Other basic training contains but not limits the area from how to design safe experiments, do the exact procedures and deal with lab waste.
c)Please give a link to the laboratory safety training requirements of your institution (college,university,community lab,etc).Or,if you cannot give a link,briefly describe the requirements.
1.Personal Safety, including body and clothing protection, eye protection and hand protection;
2.Known pathogens should never be used in the lab, and the treatment of virus, bacteria and other microscopic organisms should under states requirements;
3.Detailed recordings the facility and material useless are necessary;
2. Your Local Rules and Regulations
a)Who is responsible for biological safety at your institution?(You might have an Institutional Biosafety Committee,an Office of Environmental Health and Safety,a single Biosafety Officer,or some other arrangement,have you discussed your project with them?Describe any concerns they raised,and any changes you made in your project based on your discussion.
Assets Management Bureau in Shanghai Jiaotong University is responsible for SJTU-Biox-iGEM biological safety matter.
Our team has discussed the project under current conditions.
The main concern about out project is from the following areas, the safety of material, procedures of molecular experiment and treatment of lab waste. Based on the suggestions they offered, the material we are utilizing during the project are all from iGEM Official Foundation.
b)What are the biosafety guidelines of your institution?Please give a link to these guidelines,or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.

In your country,What are the regulations that govern biosafety in research laboratories?Please give a link to these regulations,or briefly describe them if you cannot give a link.

3.Risks of Your Project Now
a)Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:
Basic experiments relating electrophorese and other high risky operations;
b)Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):
Bactria with resistance genes, if escaped from lab to natural environment coincidently, may be harmful to unknown organisms.
c)Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
Materials may bring risks to environment, these chemicals are including but not limiting to relevance of electrophorese and other toxic chemicals.
d)Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
Unpredictable now.
e)What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
1.All the materials we would use are classified and carefully preserved;
2.Group members received professional and practical instructions and trainings before they enter the lab;
3.Under the requirements the management offered, the biomaterials we got out of college are all from iGEM Official Foundation.
4.Risks of Your Project in the Future
a)What new risks might arise from your project's growth? (Consider the categories of risk listed in parts a-d of the previous question: lab workers, the general public, the environment, and malicious mis-uses.) Also, what risks might arise if the knowledge you generate or the methods you develop became widely available?
The project we are working for is relating to Fundamental Advances, that is, to increase certain biological function by our methods. We cannot projected the future use, especially when it comes to the industrial application, since we did not limit the possible usage area it may contain. The following areas may bring our attention to its further uses:
1.The over use the combining system may bring organism into a dangerous condition, and these organisms cannot be more likely to produce hazardous substances.
2.When such system which can improve certain biological functions, could help to let creature get advantage when competing with other creatures, and the others have the possibility of being the dangerous situation;
3.Some people may use it to produce biological toxic or the like.
b)Does your project currently include any design features to reduce risks? Or, if you did all the future work to make your project grow into a popular product, would you plan to design any new features to minimize risks? (For example: auxotrophic chassis, physical containment, etc.) Such features are not required for an iGEM project, but many teams choose to explore them.
We plan to set lethal genes into the host organism, this procedure can bring less risks and may be useful when it comes to the industrial usage. The lethal genes or other who can bring self-control or conditional dependence management can bring the artificial system to the area with reason instruction by certain researchers and users. In the future, our team will design new, safe and easy-control ancillary systems to help our project become a more usable tools for synthetic biology.
Security
The bacteria(E.coli) we use are common and safe. It belongs to the Risk Group 1. We are all well trained in the field of lab safety. When we work in the lab, we pay much attention to our own safety and try to protect ourselves under all circumstances.
The plasmid constructed by us will not produce any toxic substance.
Environment
As our project is so fundamental, the engineering bacteria constructed by us will only be used in a laboratory or factory. They will not escape to the environment as long as the lab/factory deals with them properly. So the influence it can exert on the environment is negligible.
