We truly believe that it is the key to bringing dynamic and new ideas to our iGEM community. And it is our job to observe others’ opinions as well as to give others advice. Therefore, this is not only our human practice presentation but also proof for the friendship between our team and all the groups or individuals below.</P></DIV><DIV padding-bottom="130px" class="block"><H3>2014/4/12-SJTU Aniversary Carnival</H3><P>We first focused on our own school community. After all these years of support from the university, we really wanted to bring fun activities to help everyone learn the beauty of life and synthetic biology.</P><P>In April, with the opportunity of School Anniversary Carnival, we designed games about gene codes and biology lab equipment for people to participate in. Over 100 people stepped in our tent and enjoyed their time with us.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H3>2014 Summer Vacation-Shenzhen Foreign Languages School</H3><P>This year we were also lucky to have younger iGEMers’ companion. SFLS iGEM Team has recently become an official partner of our team. Our cooperation mainly contains two parts. Based on same focus on membrane, Shenzhen_SFLS Lvdagunr project of 2014 iGEM HS utilized the LGT membrane protein Biobricks BBa_K771107 and BBa_K771102 which was submitted by 2012 SJTU-BioX-Shanghai. 
Also, one of their teammate, Zhang Yuyin, came to our lab to help out. With the summer visit, we had a lot to share with each other considering the same interest.</P></DIV><DIV class="block"><H3>2014/8/3~8/7-The 2014 iGEM Formosa in NCTU</H3><P>During August 3rd to 7th 2014, 7 of our team members attended the 2014 iGem Formosa in NCTU.Over 20 team presented their idea with speeches and posters.
