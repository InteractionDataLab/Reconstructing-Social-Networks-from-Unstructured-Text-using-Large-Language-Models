Nicholas
Michelle
On a day in paradise, Nicholas would be found eating a delicious meal, reading a great book, and playing squash. A sophomore from Seattle, Washington has a real passion for computation, especially when applied to biology. In addition, he has become known as the funniest member of the team. One of his greatest quotes, “Cold room or die”, has become a classic Harvard BioDesign joke, succinctly describing the struggle that is the cold room. One of the parts of the project that he is most excited about is the potential for biological cryptography.
Michelle, a sophomore undergraduate, wants to live in a world full of her grandma’s home cooked noodles with a fried egg, painting, funny farm animals and trying to play Mario kart. Hailing from Long Island, New York, Michelle brings her love of art, design, family, good food, and laughs , along with the expertise in synthetic biology that she has developed through prior commitment to scientific research. Known for her wonderful sense of humor, attention to detail and neon color-blocked backpack, she has been a really valuable contributor to this year’s iGEM team.
Tiana
Jonah
If Tiana lived in an ideal world, her days would be filled with chocolate, family, fireworks and random adventures. Her love of science began at an early age and she can attribute the spark that led her to do research to her involvement in an amazing program, Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science (MITES). From Katy, Texas, she has decided to study Biomedical Engineering with a possible secondary in Computer Science. She is incredibly grateful for the amazing opportunity she had to learn and contribute to Harvard iGEM.
A Boston native who loves The Beatles, Jonah is a sophomore planning on studying philosophy as an undergraduate. His strong interests in an array of fields, including philosophy, politics, physics and biology allow him to take an interdisciplinary approach in solving problems and developing ideas, making him a great asset to the team. If you see him, ask him about the economy of China. In addition to the great brainstorming, mini-prepping and transformations he’s done in the lab, he has been writing a manual on the Chinese economy and economic policy for his involvement in Model United Nations at Harvard.
