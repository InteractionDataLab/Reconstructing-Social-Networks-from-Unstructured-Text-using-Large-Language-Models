Construction n°3: PSB1C3 with K823012-E1010
Other constructions of the Anderson library of constitutive promoters
PSB1C3+E0240+J23101, PSB1C3+E0240+J23118, PSB1C3+E0240+J23105, PSB1C3+E0240+J23106 and PSB1C3+E0240+J23107:
Transformation plate from the 10th September observation. There were 50 colonies for each constructions.
PSB1C3+E0240+J23101 and PSB1C3+E0240+J23118,
PCR colony of 3 colonies for each construction following protocol table 1 and 2.
GEL 1: 1% agarose gel.
Lane 1 to 3: PCR product of 3 colonies of the PSB1C3+E0240+J23101 construction.
Lane 4 to 6: PCR product of 3 colonies of the PSB1C3+E0240+J23118 construction.
PCR purification of sample 1 and 4 of the Gel 1 were purified with the NucleoSpin kit (Macherey Nagel). DNA was quantify by Nanodrop 2000.
Preparation of samples to sequencing. N° XX
Preparation of 3 ml cultures LB Cam. Incubation overnight at 37°C.
PSB1C3+E0240+J23100, PSB1C3+E0240+J23102, PSB1C3+E0240+J23103, PSB1C3+E0240+J23104 and PSB1C3+E0240+J23118,
PCR colony of 1 colony for each construction following protocol table 1 and 2.
GEL 2: 1% agarose gel.
Lane 1: PCR product of 1 colonies of the PSB1C3+E0240+J23100 construction.
Lane 2: PCR product of 1 colonies of the PSB1C3+E0240+J23102 construction.
Lane 3: PCR product of 1 colonies of the PSB1C3+E0240+J23103 construction.
Lane 4: PCR product of 1 colonies of the PSB1C3+E0240+J23104 construction.
A pre-culture was made for each colony to make a glycerol stock.
