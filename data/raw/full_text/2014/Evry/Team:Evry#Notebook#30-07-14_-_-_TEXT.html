Curve of growth
We previously tried to af a curve of grotwh by mesuring the DO (600nm), but because of the opaqueness of the MB these data are useless.
We measured the growth of Pseudovibrio denitrificans on the TECAN in M9-CASA+3%NaCl and MB filtred (because of the opaqueness of the non filtred MB)
Unfortunately, cells didn't grow very well in the TECAN due to the little volume use and the ratio air/culture which is not optimal.
