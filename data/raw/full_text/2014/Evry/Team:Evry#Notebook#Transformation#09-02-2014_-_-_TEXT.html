Transformation of Pseudovrbrio with pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 - Results
Positive control with E.Coli :
Resulst with Pseudovibrio :
NB: The negative control with E.Coli does'nt work on any plates. The culture was probably too old.
A problem occurs with stocks of electro-competent Pseudovibrio because wa can see that it growth on Kanamycine 1:1000.  On Chloramphenicol, the contamination does'nt seem to grow.
We have to prove that it's Pseudovibrio wich growth on Chloramphenicol.
