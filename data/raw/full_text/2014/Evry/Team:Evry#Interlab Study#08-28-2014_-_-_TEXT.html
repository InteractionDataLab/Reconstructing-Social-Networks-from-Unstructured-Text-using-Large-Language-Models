Team:Evry/Interlab Study/08-28-2014
From 2014.igem.org
Contruction n°2: PSB1C3 with J23101-E1010
Contruction n°3: PSB1C3 with K823012-E1010
PCR colony was done on 7 colonies:
Steril H2O:34,5µL
5X Q5 Reaction buffer: 10µL
Template:2µL
10mM dNTP: 1µL
10µM Primer forward VF2: 1µL
10µM Primer reverse VR: 1µL
Q5 DNA Polymerase: 0,5µL
A migration of PCR product was done. We expect to observe in each wells a band of 1176bp:
6 colonies have a band at 1200 bp around so we decided to choose colonies n°2, 3 and 4.
Other constructions of the Anderson library of constitutive promoters
Promoters were resuspended from 2014 distribution kit plates with 10 µl of sterile MiliQ watter and stored at -20°C.
Table: Additional promoters of the Interlab Study. In grey, plasmids already resuspended, transformed, sequenced and stock glycerol existed.
