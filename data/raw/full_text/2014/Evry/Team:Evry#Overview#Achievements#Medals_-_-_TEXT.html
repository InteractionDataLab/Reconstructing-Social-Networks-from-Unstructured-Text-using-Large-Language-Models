-     iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, here we describe describe how our team considered the(se) question(s) within our project. A preview of the questions raised can be found below:
In synthetic biology, there is a contrast between the expectations (rigorous designs) and the reality (trials, errors and tinkering). It is crucial for students to question whether synthetic biology can truly be compared to engineering or if it is the result of inelegant but efficient kludges. The use of sponges raises ethical issues such as the modification of its microbiome, its use as a bioremediation tool and if the epibiosis could efficiently contain engineered bacteria in sponges.
Bronze Medal
-   We registered our team for iGEM 2014
-   We completed and submitted the Judging form .
-   We made a comprehensive and accessible iGEM Evry 2014 Wiki to convey our educational and scientific advances.
-   We will present a poster and give an oral presentation at the iGEM Jamboree in Boston, USA.
-   Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.
