Amplification of pRhokHI-2 in E.Coli Bl21
The transformation of E.Coli with pRhokHi-2 still didn't works. We still have to amplify it so we re-tried to the tranformation (1µL of plasmid for 40µL of cells, 1800V).
This time, after a liquid culture of only one hours cells were plated on LB 1X + Kan (1:1000), LB 1X + Cam (1:1000), and LB only and let in incubator overnight.
