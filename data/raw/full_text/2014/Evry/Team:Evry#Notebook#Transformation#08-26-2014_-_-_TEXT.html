Transformation of Pseudovribrio with pBBR1MCS - Results
We saw no colony on our plates. We decided to test our two replicates of transformation on MB 1X plates with other concentrations of antibiotic. We made three plates with Cam 1:5000, and 1:10 000, then Pseudovibrio were showed on them and let overnight in incubator.
