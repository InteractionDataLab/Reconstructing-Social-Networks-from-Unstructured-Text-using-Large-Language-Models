The team
iGEM Evry team 2014 is composed of students from Licence 3 (3rd year after baccalaureate) to M2 (5th year after baccalaureate) from different universities and schools with various specialties as biology, computer science, biotechnology, ethics...     We worked together from June to October in order to realize our project. Each member brought his own knowledge and his "savoir-faire" to share and build the Sponge Patrol Project.
We have lived an amazing experience and adventure all together.
Laboratory
Biologist team spent summer in Institute of Systems & Synthetic Biology (ISSB), Evry working in the laboratory. The biologist team is composed of Cécile Jacry,  Laura Matabishi, Nandjafot Mendy, Noémie Berenger-Curria, Julie Zaworski, Sophia Belkhelfa , Romain Bodinier, Matthieu Da Costa and Johanna Chesnel. Biologist supervisors: Tiffany Souterre and Tristan Cerisy were presents and supportive.
Any piece of the ISSB laboratory is mysterious today.
Modelisation
Bioinformatic team spent summer in Institute of Systems & Synthetic Biology (ISSB), Evry working in partnership with biologist. The bioinformatic student team is composed of Bernard Jesop, Anaïs Louis and William Digan. Bioinformatic supervisors with Pierre Parutto and Adrien Basso-Blandin gave significant hand all along the project.
One day biologist and bioinformatist will be one.
Policy and Pratices
Sophie Gontier was our philosopher and spent summer in laboratory and shared room working about ethic questions and share with biologist and bioinformatist all along about her thoughts.
We create only because we watch out for the world around.

Wiki
All members was concerned about fill in the wiki. Anaïs Louis and William Digan have managed it, and Matthieu Da Costa carry about schema and representations. Thanks to Olivier Leplus and Jean-Baptiste Munières.
The Institute of Systems and Synthetic Biology (iSSB)
Our team was received by the iSSB all along the year firstly for our Wednesday meeting then all the summer. The iSSB is a laboratory at the University of Evry and CNRS, supported by Genopole®.
