From 2014.igem.org
It’s the first day where Brian Jester gave us the plasmid pNK2. This plasmid contains transposon.
A Precultur of DH5α pir is realized.In a 15 mL tube, add 2 mL of LB medium and inoculate cells from glycerol. These cells can replicate the plasmid because they contains pi protein.
It parallel annotation of plasmid pNK2 with Blast is realized.
