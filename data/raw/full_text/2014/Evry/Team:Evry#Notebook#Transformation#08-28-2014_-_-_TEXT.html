Amplification of pRhokHI-2 in E.Coli Bl21 - Results
After incubation overnight we can see some colonies of E.Coli Bl21 transformed on LB+Cam 1:1000 and on LB+Kan 1:1000. Our Bl21 which had not been transformed doesn't growth on these media but both grow on LB only. We had well success to tranform E.Coli and amplifly the plasmid.
We tranfered two colonies into liquid MB+Kan(1:1000) and let them in incubator overnight to have a pre-culture for the plasmid purification with NucleoSpin Plamsid Kit (Macherey Nagel).
