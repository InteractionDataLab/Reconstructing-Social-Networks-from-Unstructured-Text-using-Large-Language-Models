After complete dissolution, the solution was sterilized in the Tuttmauer 2540ML apparatus, STE 20 minutes at 121°C and EXT+DRY 15 minutes. 50 µl of kanamycin stock solution (25 mg/L) was added to 50 ml of LB agar to pour 2 plates. 150 µl of chloramphenicol stock solution was added in the 150 LB agar remaining ml to pour 6 plates.  
 The transformation was performed on DH5 alpha ''E. coli'', as followed: </P><OL><LI> Remove E. coli competent tubes from -80°C and keep it on ice
</LI><LI> Add 1 µl of template (here solubilized plasmids from the registry distribution kit) and mix gently
</LI><LI> Incubate 10 minutes on ice
</LI><LI> Perform an heat shock 30 seconds at 42°C
</LI><LI> Incubate 2 minutes on ice
</LI><LI> Add 3 ml of LB medium and incubate 60 minutes at 37°C with an agitation at 200 rpm
</LI><LI> Plate 200 µl of BBa_E0240 on a chloramphenicol LB agar plate and BBa_I20260 on a Knamycin LB agar plate
