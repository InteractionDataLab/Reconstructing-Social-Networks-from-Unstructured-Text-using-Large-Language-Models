From 2014.igem.org
PCR using VF2 and VR primer
Q5 polymerase
Expected bands :
DmpR: 2038 bp
GFP B0031: 1331 bp
GFP B0032: 1330 bp
Digestion
From newly extracted DNA
DmpR: SpeI&PstI
GFP B0031/32: XbaI&PstI
Analysis
VF2/VR PCR products are still in agreement with the expected size either for DmpR and GFP B0031/32.
GFP 31/32 digestion products were in agreement with the expected size.
DmpR digestion by SP is still displaying 2 close bands profile.
