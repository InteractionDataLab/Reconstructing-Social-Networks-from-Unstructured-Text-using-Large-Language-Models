Measure of GFP
A measure of fluorescence (GFP) is realised by means of TECAN.  This Tecan isn't concluding.

A result of sequencing of PseudoD with transposon is received. The sequence of 16S pseudoD is compared with the sequencing. There are 100% of identity. So it's  PseudoD , which is transformed.
