Amplification of plasmids pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 in E.Coli Bl21
Two plasmids pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 were generously sent by Dr Thomas DREPPER (University Duesseldorf, Dept. of Biology, Institute of Molecular Enzyme Technology)
Bowth were transfered into Bl21 electro-competent cells by electroporation (two replicate)(1µL of plasmid for 40µL of cells, 1800V).
After a liquid culture of three hours, cells were plated on LB 1X + Cam (1:1000) and let in incubator overnight.
