From 2014.igem.org
Survival test on E.coli BL21:
10mg of 2 hydroxy,3'-4'dichlorobiphenyl have been received. The compound was lyophilized so it's has been dissolved in 17mL of DMSO in order to have a final concentration of 10(-2)M
The compound was stored at -20°C, in the dark because the DMSO is sensitive to the light.
