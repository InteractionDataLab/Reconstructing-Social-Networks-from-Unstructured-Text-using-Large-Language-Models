electrocompetent cells:
1 mm cuvette; 1800 V
recuperation media: MB for Pseudovibrio denitrificans , LB for DH5alpha
plating:
MB agar for Pseudovibrio denitrificans
LB agar for LB for DH5alpha
Transformation Pseudovibrio denitrificans & Dh5 alpha with BBa_1413001 in BBa_1413044
electrocompetent cells:
1 mm cuvette; 1800 V
recuperation media: MB for Pseudovibrio denitrificans , LB for DH5alpha
plating:
MB agar for Pseudovibrio denitrificans

Verification testing of pnK2 in Pseudovibrio denitrificans
16  clones of Pseudovibrio denitrificans were grown in 3 ml MB, 30 C°, 24h
DNA extraction:
Invitrogen DNA extraction kit used with the Gram - protocol.
nanodrops gave value between 80 ng/ul & 130 ng/ul
PCR for Kan gene insertion:
PCR: enzyme: Q5; template: 200 ng genomic preparation Pseudovibrio denitrificans; oligo: F 82/ R 83; Tm tested: 55; elongation time: 2m00s
PCR for Pseudovibrio denitrificans specific oligo:
PCR: enzyme: Q5; template: 200 ng genomic preparation Pseudovibrio denitrificans; oligo: F 72/ R 73; Tm tested: 55; elongation time: 2m00s
As a control we tested the specificity of our oligo on the strain we work with:
