New stocks are ready for antibiotics' tests on Pseudovribrio
Launch of antibiotics's tests in liquid M9 1X
For each tested antibiotic we made the following range of concentrations:
0
1:500
1:1000
1:50 000
1:100 000
We made these range two time to have a replicate and we added a controle tube without antibiotic for each bacteria.  Each tube is made like in the following table in Falcon tubes (15mL):

For each range, we test Pseudovibrio denitrificans but also E.Coli and E.Coli tranformed with a speicific resistance cassette (NM:The E.Coli strain for the control case is the same strain that is tranformed for the cassette efficiency test). The initial OD at 600nm of each bacteria has been mesured to after be able to calculate the ΔOD at 600nm, during three days.

Plates for antibiotics's tests
For each tested antibiotic we made the same range of concentrations than in liquid. We also made these range two time to have a replicate and we added a controle plate without antibiotic on which we showed all our tested bacteria. Plates will be checked during three days. We made these same ranges of tested antibiotic's concentrations for three media:
MB agar 1X
MB agar 0.5X
M9 agar 1X
Each plate is made like in the following table:
