From 2014.igem.org
The map of the first plasmid pNK2 isn’t ok. There was mistake because this isn’t the RFP in the transposon but emGFP.
To verified the insertion we used a new couple of primer 42b and 92c.
This approach did not work. There is no band revealed on the gel. So this new primers which amplified the kanamycin in the transposas is bought.
