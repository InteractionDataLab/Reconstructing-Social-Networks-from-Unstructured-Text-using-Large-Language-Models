New protocols of electrocompetent Pseudovibrio
On a pre-culture of Pseudovibrio in MB 1X 3mL, we relaunch the culture in 100mL of MB 1X. We made the electrocompetent protocol ( Protocole ).
We tested to make 5 and 6 washes with glycerol 10% instead of three.  Stocks of cells were stored at -80°C (3 weeks maximum)
