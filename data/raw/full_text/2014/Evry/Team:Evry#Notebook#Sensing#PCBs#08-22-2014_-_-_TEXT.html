Transformation plate observation:
- BBa_E1010: 50-60 colonies
- BBa_J23114: 150-200 colonies
- BBa_B0015: 40-50 colonies
- PSB1C3G3: > 1000 red colonies
A PCR was performed on 8 colonies for BBa_J23115 (K823012) following the protocol Table 3 and 4.
Samples are loaded on a 1% agarose gel, 10 µL of sample + 2 µl of loading dye 6X per well. Gel ran 45 minutes at 100 mV.
Sensor construction bphR2/PbphR1 :
One colony of the transformation of pSB1C3 was incubated in 3ml LB + 3µL Cam, at 37°C, overnight
