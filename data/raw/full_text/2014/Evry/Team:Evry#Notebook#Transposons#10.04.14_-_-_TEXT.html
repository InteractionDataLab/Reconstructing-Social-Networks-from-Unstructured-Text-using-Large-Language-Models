Construction of Universal Transposas Plasmid
We want mRFP digested with biobrick enzyme to put into Universal Transposon Plasmid.
For this a plasmid pSB1C3 (RFC 92) is took and digested with X P.
After that the product of digestion is migrated, to do an extraction on gel of mRFP.
Universal Transposas Plasmid
There is ¾ of the plate Golden gate Universal Plasmid with white colonie. The rest is red, and tese is the colonie with mRFP.
PCR on 11 colonies is realized with primer VF and VR.
After migration all the samples have a band at 500 bp. It corresponds to empty plasmid.
The Golden Gate didn't work.
