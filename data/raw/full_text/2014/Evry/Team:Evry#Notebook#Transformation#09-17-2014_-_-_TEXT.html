Transformation of Pseudovrbrio with pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 - Confirmation
We tried to confirm the presence of our plasmid of previous transformations by extracting potential plasmids and digest them with EcoRI. After the incubation and the inactivation of the enzyme, products were migrating.
No band on the gel. The control (lab stock) didn't work either, so there is probably a problem of quantity of DNA.
