There was a problem with the stock of Kanamycine so we made a new one at 25mg/mL. For the erythrompycine, we learn that E. Coli is not really sensitive to this antibiotic and that it's better to use it  with a dilution at 1:100.

Any liquid culture can be plated and will grow up. Of course, it works better on MB medium, wich is a rich medium than on M9.
