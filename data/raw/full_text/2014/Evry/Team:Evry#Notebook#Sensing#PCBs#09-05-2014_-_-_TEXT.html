Sensor construction bphR2/PbpR1
Miniprep was made for each part and the nanodrop gives:
J23114-rbs: 205 ng/µl
bphR2: 227,5ng/µl
bphR1:57,2ng/µl
RFP: 74,2ng/µl
terminator:54,6ng/µl
pSB1C3,G3: 182,7ng/µl
A new PCR has been done by using Q5 DNA polymerase for all the parts expected for the terminator (one taq polymerase)
