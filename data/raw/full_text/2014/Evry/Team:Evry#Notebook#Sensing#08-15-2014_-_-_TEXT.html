Week 7
Sensor construction HbpR/PhbpC/HbpC:
Purification of pHYB130 plasmid with NucleoSpin plasmid protocol => we obtained 91,8ng/µL
Survival test on E.coli BL21:
A lab stock of 2 hydroxy-3',4'dichlorobiphenyl at 10(-2)mol/L was made by dissolving 10mg in DMSO
Serial dilution of compound was made from 10(-2) mol/L to 10(-8) mol/L
300µL of E.coli BL21 was added in each eppendorf tube.
We had 2 control tubes:
A negative control: 2,7mL of M9 medium + 300µL of compound
A positive control: 2,7mL of M9 medium + 300µL of E.coli BL21
Incubation of tubes at 37°C overnight, 200rpm
