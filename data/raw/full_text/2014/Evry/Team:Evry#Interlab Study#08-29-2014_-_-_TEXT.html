Construction n°1: PSB1C3 with I20260
Selected colonies PCR products from the 28/08/2014 were purified with the NucleoSpin kit (Macherey Nagel). DNA was quantify by Nanodrop 2000.
Colony n°2: 30.7 ng/µl  and A260/280 1.92
Colony n°4: 52.3 ng/µl  and A260/280 1.75
Colony n°7: 26.1 ng/µL  and A260/280 1.72
Samples were send to sequencing. N° 26DJ96, 26DJ97, 26DJ98, 26DJ99, 26EA00 and 26EA01.
