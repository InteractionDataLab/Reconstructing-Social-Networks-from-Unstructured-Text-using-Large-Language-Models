Pseudovibrio denitrificans : An unknown bacterium
Pseudovibrio is a genus of the bacterial family Rhodobacteraceae which is not very well known in the scientific community.  The main goal of our project is based on the transformation of these bacteria to develop a new and ecological way to sense and degrade water pollutants. To succeed, we needed to have some knowledge about them.
