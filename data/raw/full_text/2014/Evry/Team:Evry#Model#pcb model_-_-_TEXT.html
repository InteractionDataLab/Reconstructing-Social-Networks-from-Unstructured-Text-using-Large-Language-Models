Introduction
After considering the water flux and pollutant motions in our sponge, we investigated the sensing power of our PCB construction .
We first modelled the behaviour of RFP production regarding PCB absorption to determine if our sensing strategy was viable. However, we previously tried to create a particle system of our system in the cell.
