Survivability in molecules which are going to be sensed:
Ranges of concentrations of molecules that we want to sense were made as described in following tables:
1. Serial dilutions of compound were made
Lead
Cadmium
Nitrite
2. 300µL of E.coli BL21 was added in each eppendorf tube.
We had 2 control tubes:
*A negative control: 2,7mL of MB medium + 300µL of compound
*A positive control: 2,7mL of MB medium + 300µL of E.coli BL21
3. Incubation of tubes at 30°C overnight, 200rpm
