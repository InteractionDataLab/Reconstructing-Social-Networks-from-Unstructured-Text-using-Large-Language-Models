Antibiotics' tests on MB 1X plates - Results Day3
Results of antibiotics' tests on plate are calculated as percentage of bacteria's growth by compared with the controle case. Pseudovibrio coming from culture with antibiotics (part B on plates), are taken from antibiotics' range in M9 at Day2.
Chloramphenicol
Kanamycin
Ampicilin
Tetracyclin
Erythromycin

Differed launch of antibiotics' tests
Tests of Kanamycin's resistance cassette:

Tests of Ampicilin's resistance cassette:
Antibiotics' tests in liquid M9 for E.Coli transformed with a plasmid PSB1A3 containing an ampicilin resistance cassette were launch. In two days, these cultures will be plated on MB 1X, MB 0.5X and M9 1X plates
