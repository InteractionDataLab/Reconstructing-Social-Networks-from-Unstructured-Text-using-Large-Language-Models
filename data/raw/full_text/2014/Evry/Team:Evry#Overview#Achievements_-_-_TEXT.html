-     iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, here we describe describe how our team considered the(se) question(s) within our project. A preview of the questions raised can be found below:
In synthetic biology, there is a contrast between the expectations (rigorous designs) and the reality (trials, errors and tinkering). It is crucial for students to question whether synthetic biology can truly be compared to engineering or if it is the result of inelegant but efficient kludges. The use of sponges raises ethical issues such as the modification of its microbiome, its use as a bioremediation tool and if the epibiosis could efficiently contain engineered bacteria in sponges.
Bronze Medal
-   We registered our team for iGEM 2014
-   We completed and submitted the Judging form .
-   We made a comprehensive and accessible iGEM Evry 2014 Wiki to convey our educational and scientific advances.
-   We will present a poster and give an oral presentation at the iGEM Jamboree in Boston, USA.
-   Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.

iGEM prizes
Environmental track
- Real-time monitoring with a bioactive filtration system, a sponge and its microbiome.
- Design with the aim not to introduce a new species in a fragile ecosystem.
- Environnementaly safe design, not transferrable to descendance.
- Working on an organism people know and are confortable with: the "bath sponge".
Best measurement
- Participation to the Interlab Study working not only on the 3 mandatory genetic devices but also the 18 promoters from Anderson’s library.
- Designed a phenol biosensor able to detect phenol at lower concentrations than previous teams.
Best Policy & Practices Advance
- Extensive report of our philosophical reflexion on the contrast between the ambitions of synthetic biology (rigorous designs) and the reality (trial, error and kludges), which we conducted over the summer.
- Debate on the ethical questions raised by the modification of an animal's microbiome, and by the use of an animal as a bioremediation tool in potentially toxic areas.
- Reflexion about the risks inherent to the release of genetically modified organisms in seawater, and on the possibility and efficiency of epibiosis as a biological containment.
Best New Basic Part
- Bring Transposons Tn10 to the iGEM competition, giving a chance to other teams to develop a project in a wider range of chassis.
Projects Achievements
Chassis characterization
- Genome Sequencing of Pseudovibrio denitrificans to collect informations defense mechanisms,
transposons putative insertion localisation and to possess a assembled genome for RNAseq.
- Growth conditions optimization
- Antibiotic sensitivity tests shown a potential resistance to tetracycline and ampicilline
- Electroporation Transformation protocol establishment that never been done before
New Vector
- Transposon-based vector was created to overcome resistance mechanisms to DNA entrance
- Proof of concept to use it in Pseudovibrio denitrificans was achieved
New or Optimized sensors Sensors
- New PCB sensor based on bphR1 promoter and binding protein bphR2.
- An optimized version of the Phenol sensors from Pekin iGEM 2013 team was constructed
- RNA-seq data shall be used to find new promoters
