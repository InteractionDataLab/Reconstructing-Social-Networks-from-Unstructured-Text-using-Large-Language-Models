New protocols of electrocompetent Pseudovibrio - Results
The transformation didn't work with Pseudovibrio washed 5 times or 6 times.
Oct 09
New protocols of electrocompetent Pseudovibrio
Transformation was perfomed on the new stocks made the 10-06-14 with two types of washes. 1µL of plasmids PBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 (25 and 33ng/mL).
2000 V
( Protocole )
Oct 07
New protocols of electrocompetent Pseudovibrio
On a pre-culture of Pseudovibrio in MB 1X 3mL, we relaunch the culture in 100mL of MB 1X. We made the electrocompetent protocol ( Protocole ).
We tested to make 5 and 6 washes with glycerol 10% instead of three.  Stocks of cells were stored at -80°C (3 weeks maximum)
Oct 06
Transformation of Pseudovrbrio with pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 - Confirmation
We tried to confirm the presence of our plasmid of previous transformations by extracting potential plasmids and digest them with EcoRI. After the incubation and the inactivation of the enzyme, products were migrating.
No band on the gel. The control (lab stock) didn't work either, so there is probably a problem of quantity of DNA.

Transformation of Pseudovrbrio with pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 - Results
The transformation didn't work.

Transformation of Pseudovrbrio with pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 - Confirmation
A contamination has been shown in another transformation test. We can't use our previous results because there is a chance that it's not Pseudovibrio but the contamination which had been transformed. We can still try to prove that it's our bacteria (with amplification of specific sequence) ond that there is our plasmids.
New transformation was tried with another stock of competent Pseudovibrio ( Protocole ) and cells were plated on MB/MB+Cam(1:1000)/MB+Kan(1:1000).
Stock of pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2
The colony of E.Coli transformed in LB 1X + Cam (1:1000) culture of 3mL was sowed on new LB/LB+Cam(1:1000)/LB+Kan(1:1000) plates and incubated with shaking overnight at 37°C.
Sep 10
Transformation of Pseudovrbrio with pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 - Confirmation
The previous digestion could fail because of the too little time of incubation (15min). We re-try to make the digestion with an incubation of 1 hour.
Gel of digestion with XbaI (2)
There was a problem with the digestion. We are going to try with another enzyme.
Stock of pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2
To remake a stock of these plasmids, we showed a colony of E.Coli transformed in a new LB 1X + Cam (1:1000) culture of 3mL.
Sep 09
Transformation of Pseudovrbrio with pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 - Confirmation
We made a restriction control of our plasmid, and we tried to prove that these plasmids are present in our Pseudovibrio.
After made a purification of plasmids in A1 and A2 with NucleoSpin Plamsid Kit (Macherey Nagel), we obtained concentrations at 380.1 ng/µL for pRhokHI-2 and at 91.1 ng/µL for pBBR1MCS.
We disgested these sample and our stock of pRhokHI-2 and pBBR1MCS with XbaI (unique restriction site on these plasmids) and we have make migrate the product of digestion.
Gel of digestion with XbaI
There was a problem with the digestion. We are going to try with a longer time of incubation.
Stock of pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2
To remake a stock of these plasmids, we put in liquid LB+Cam (1:1000) culture, a colony from a LB+Cam plate of E.Coli transformed.

New stock of electro competents Pseudovribio - Antibiotics' control
Sep 06
New stock of electro competents Pseudovribio
We choose to make a new stock of electro competent Pseudovibrio denitrificans.
We made a culture of 100mL from a pre-culture of 10mL made the 04/09.
The new stock was test on plates MB 1X with Cam and Kan (1:1000).
Sep 05
Transformation of Pseudovrbrio with pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 - Results
Positive control with E.Coli :
Resulst with Pseudovibrio :
NB: The negative control with E.Coli does'nt work on any plates. The culture was probably too old.
A problem occurs with stocks of electro-competent Pseudovibrio because wa can see that it growth on Kanamycine 1:1000.  On Chloramphenicol, the contamination does'nt seem to grow.
We have to prove that it's Pseudovibrio wich growth on Chloramphenicol.

Amplification of pRhokHI-2 in E.Coli Bl21 - Results
After incubation overnight we can see some colonies of E.Coli Bl21 transformed on LB+Cam 1:1000 and on LB+Kan 1:1000. Our Bl21 which had not been transformed doesn't growth on these media but both grow on LB only. We had well success to tranform E.Coli and amplifly the plasmid.
We tranfered two colonies into liquid MB+Kan(1:1000) and let them in incubator overnight to have a pre-culture for the plasmid purification with NucleoSpin Plamsid Kit (Macherey Nagel).

Amplification of pRhokHI-2 in E.Coli Bl21
The transformation of E.Coli with pRhokHi-2 still didn't works. We still have to amplify it so we re-tried to the tranformation (1µL of plasmid for 40µL of cells, 1800V).
This time, after a liquid culture of only one hours cells were plated on LB 1X + Kan (1:1000), LB 1X + Cam (1:1000), and LB only and let in incubator overnight.

Transformation of Pseudovribrio with pBBR1MCS - Results
We saw no colony on our plates. We decided to test our two replicates of transformation on MB 1X plates with other concentrations of antibiotic. We made three plates with Cam 1:5000, and 1:10 000, then Pseudovibrio were showed on them and let overnight in incubator.

Amplification of pRhokHI-2 in E.Coli Bl21
We re-tried to transform E.Coli with pRhokHI-2 to amplify it (1µL of plasmid for 40µL of cells, 1800V). This time, after a liquid culture of only one hours cells were plated on LB 1X + Kan (1:1000) and let in incubator overnight.
Transformation of Pseudovribrio with pBBR1MCS
After made a purification of pBBR1MCS with NucleoSpin Plamsid Kit (Macherey Nagel), electrocompetent Pseudovibrio cells were tranformed with the plasmid by electroporation (1µL of plasmid for 40µL of cells, 1800V), then they were incubated for three hours and showed on MB 1X+Cam (1:1000) plates.

Two plasmids pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 were generously sent by Dr Thomas DREPPER (University Duesseldorf, Dept. of Biology, Institute of Molecular Enzyme Technology)
Bowth were transfered into Bl21 electro-competent cells by electroporation (two replicate)(1µL of plasmid for 40µL of cells, 1800V).
After a liquid culture of three hours, cells were plated on LB 1X + Cam (1:1000) and let in incubator overnight.

There was a problem with the stock of Kanamycine so we made a new one at 25mg/mL. For the erythrompycine, we learn that E. Coli is not really sensitive to this antibiotic and that it's better to use it  with a dilution at 1:100.

Tests of antibiotics' stocks
Six plates of LB agar were made.  Five of them contained one of those antibiotics in the dilution 1:1000:
Chloramphénicol
Kanamycin
Erythromycin
Ampicilin
Tetracyclin
(The last one was the control of the growth of our bacteria without antibiotics) We sowed 10µL of a liquid LB culture of Bl21, and we let them incubate overnight at 37°C.
Survivability tests
Two plates of MB 1X and M9 1X were made and divised in two parts. Each plate was sowed with 5µL of a liquid MB 1X culture of Pseudovibrio denitrificans(dated 12th August) in a part and with 5µL of a liquid M9 1X culture Pseudovibrio denitrificans (dated 12th August) in the other part.
Pre-cultures
Cultures in MB 1X and M9 1X of Pseudovibrio were passed by a 1/10 dilution and let incubate overnight at 30°C. New cultures of different E.Coli were also started from glycerol or plate and let incubated overnight at 37°C.

From plates:
DH5a tranformed with pCB1C3 (CamR)

Bacteria tranformed with plasmid were cultivated with the corresponding antibiotic for the selection. For each medium we make a negative contrôle without bacteria.

Curve of growth
We previously tried to af a curve of grotwh by mesuring the DO (600nm), but because of the opaqueness of the MB these data are useless.
We measured the growth of Pseudovibrio denitrificans on the TECAN in M9-CASA+3%NaCl and MB filtred (because of the opaqueness of the non filtred MB)
Unfortunately, cells didn't grow very well in the TECAN due to the little volume use and the ratio air/culture which is not optimal.

After the purification, a new PCR is realized with 3μL to purificated fragments.
