Sensor construction bphR2/PbphR1:
Culturing of one colony bphR1 promoter (BBa_K1155001) , received from Paris-Saclay's team, in 5ml LB + 5µL Chloramphenicol (Cam)
Incubation at 37°C overnight, 200rpm
Jul 27
Sensor construction bphR2/PbphR1:
Plate 20µL from the culture of 27th july on LB-agar-Cam (25 mL LB-Agar + 25µL Chloramphenicol)
Incubation of plate at 37°C overnight
A glycerol stock was made with 750ml of culture and 750ml of glycerol 50% and stored at -80°C

Survivability in molecules which are going to be sensed:
Ranges of concentrations of molecules that we want to sense were made as described in following tables:
1. Serial dilutions of compound were made
Lead
Cadmium
Nitrite
2. 300µL of E.coli BL21 was added in each eppendorf tube.
We had 2 control tubes:
*A negative control: 2,7mL of MB medium + 300µL of compound
*A positive control: 2,7mL of MB medium + 300µL of E.coli BL21
3. Incubation of tubes at 30°C overnight, 200rpm

Survivability in molecules which are going to be sensed - Results:
Here are the results of the survivability of Pseudovibrio in media with molecules which are going to be sensed:
Pseudovibrio seems to survive in presence of all concentrations of nitrite, it's affect cells' growth but don't kill Pseudovibrio.
In Lead, big concentrations lead to cells' death, but Pseudovibrio survive very well until a concentration of 5µL.
Cadmium does'nt seem to block cells' growth in concentrations which we want to use.

Survival test on E.coli BL21:
10mg of 2 hydroxy,3'-4'dichlorobiphenyl have been received. The compound was lyophilized so it's has been dissolved in 17mL of DMSO in order to have a final concentration of 10(-2)M
The compound was stored at -20°C, in the dark because the DMSO is sensitive to the light.
Aug 13
Survival test on E.coli BL21:
This test allowed to know if E.coli can survive at different concentrations of 2 hydroxy-3',4'dichlorobiphenyl
For that, BL21 culture was removed from the -80°C and culturing in 4 mL of LB
E.coli was incubated overnight at 37°C, 200rpm
Aug 14
Survival test on E.coli BL21:
Serial dilution of compound was made from 10(-2) mol/L to 10(-8) mol/L
300µL of E.coli BL21 were added in each eppendorf tube.
We had 2 control tubes:
A negative control which contains 2,7mL of M9 medium + 300µL of compound
A positive control which contains 2,7mL of M9 medium + 300µL of E.coli BL21
Tubes were incubated at 37°C overnight, 200rpm

DH5a chimiocompetents were transformed with this plasmid according to this protocol:
Remove DH5a from -80°C (about 200µL) and let them on the ice
Add 100ng of plasmid at DH5a and let during 30mn on ice
Make a heat shock by putting bacteria at 42°C during 30s-1mn
Let 1h at 37°C

Dna extraction
Machery Nagel DNA purification Kit ( PROTOCOL )
PCR using VF2 and VR primer
Q5 polymerase
Expected bands :
DmpR: 2038 bp
GFP B0031: 1331 bp
GFP B0032: 1330 bp
Digestion

Analysis
VF2/VR PCR products were in agreement with the expected size either for DmpR and GFP B0031/32.
GFP 31/32 digestion products were in agreement with the expected size.
However DmpR digestion revealed an unexpected profile.
Gel extraction
Extraction of GFP B0031/32 digestion product [XbaI-PstI]
After confirmation of relevant electrophoresis bands, cut the gel all around the band and as close as possible to it.
Place the resulting piece into a 2ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 1µl of Binding buffer to 1 µg of gel. Place the tube at 55°C to 60°C during 10min or until gel turn completely liquid.
Follow classical DNA purification protocol.

Plasmid with bphR2 gene was purified with NucleoSpin Plamsid protocol (Macherey-Nagel) => we obtained 227,5ng/µL
This plasmid was digested according this protocol:
Add:
sterilized water: qsp 20µL
template DNA : 500ng
buffer 2.1: 2µL
BSA: 0,2µL
EcoRI: 1µL
PstI: 1µL
Reverse for mix
Incubate at 37°C during 45mn
Incubate at 80°C during 20mn
Ligation was not possible because pSB1C3 plasmid was not digested so the digested plasmid (bphR2 gene) was stored at -20°C
Survival test on E.coli BL21:
Bacteria survive again for different concentrations but they were very concentrated
A dilution of the medium has been done for the positive control and the six different concentrations:

Sensor construction bphR2/PbpR1
BBa_J23114 was resuspended with 10 µL sterile water in order to obtain a DNA concentration around 0.2 ng/µl (according to the registry). Solution was transferred into one 1 ml eppendorf tube and stored at -20°C.
Transformations of constitutive promoter BBa_J23114 , RFP BBa_E1010 and terminator BBa_B0015 and vector pSB1C3G3 was done on DH5alpha as followed:
Remove E. coli competent tubes from -80°C and keep it on ice
Add 3 µl of template (here solubilized plasmids from the registry distribution kit) and mix gently
Incubate 10 minutes on ice
Perform an heat shock 30 seconds at 42°C
Incubate 2 minutes on ice
Add 2 ml of LB medium and incubate 60 minutes at 37°C with an agitation at 200 rpm
Plate 200 µl of pSB1C3G3, BBa_B0015 and E1010 on a chloramphenicol LB agar plate and ampicilline LB agar plate for BBa_J23114
Incubate plate overnight at 37°C
We received primers.
Table 4: Received primers with numbers and sequences for PCB sensing constructions
pSB1C3 was digested with EcoRI and pstI and a ligation with bphR2 was done before the transformation in DH5a.
50 µL were plated on Cam Lb plate and incubated at 37°C overnight
Aug 21
Transformation plate observation:
- BBa_E1010: 50-60 colonies
- BBa_J23114: 150-200 colonies
- BBa_B0015: 40-50 colonies
- PSB1C3G3: > 1000 red colonies
A PCR was performed on 8 colonies for BBa_J23115 (K823012) following the protocol Table 3 and 4.
Samples are loaded on a 1% agarose gel, 10 µL of sample + 2 µl of loading dye 6X per well. Gel ran 45 minutes at 100 mV.
Sensor construction bphR2/PbphR1 :
One colony of the transformation of pSB1C3 was incubated in 3ml LB + 3µL Cam, at 37°C, overnight
Aug 22
Sensor construction bphR2/PbphR1 :
Miniprep of pSB1C3 was done => 68,9ng/µl and the plasmid was digested with EcoRI-HF and pstI.
Digestion products of pSB1C3 and bphr2 has been migrated on gel 1X agarosis. Bands expected were:
for pSB1C3: one band at 2069bp (vector) and one band at 1070bp (insert)
for bphr2: one band at 946 pb (insert) and one band at 1300bp (vector)
We obtained the good bands so an extraction on gel was done to recover only pSB1C3 without its insert and only bphr2 gene.
