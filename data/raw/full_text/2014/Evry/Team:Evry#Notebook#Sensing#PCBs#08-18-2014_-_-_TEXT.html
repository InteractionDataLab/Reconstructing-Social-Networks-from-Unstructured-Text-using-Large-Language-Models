Sensor construction bphR2/PbphR1:
bphR2 gene, synthetized by Eurofins in a plasmid, was dissolved in 23,5µL of elution buffer because it was lyophilized.
Concentration obtained = 200ng/µL
DH5a chimiocompetents were transformed with this plasmid according to this protocol:
Remove DH5a from -80°C (about 200µL) and let them on the ice
Add 100ng of plasmid at DH5a and let during 30mn on ice
Make a heat shock by putting bacteria at 42°C during 30s-1mn
Let 1h at 37°C
Plate 100µL of the culture on LB-agar-Amp
Incubate at 37°C overnight, 200rpm
