Abstract
The sponge can filtrate up to 20m3 of water/day/kg making it one of the most powerful filtrating system alive. Pseudovibrio denitrificans has been shown to be part of several sponges microbiome. Our project is based on the engineering of this bacterium in order to develop a filtrating system allowing to sense and even degrade pollutants in water when cooperating with sponges.
