Transformation of Pseudovibrio denitrificans
Transformation of Pseudovibrio denitrificans (PseudoD) with pNK2 is realised, with Electric shock of 2000V .This voltage had been optimised in the part transformation. As Pseudovibrio lives with kanamycine at 25µg/mL, the cells is sowed in Marine Broth (MB) 1X with kanamycin 50µg/mL.
It parallel BL21 is so transformed with same plasmid but with electric shock of 1800V and sowed in LB 1X add kanamycin (25µg/mL).
