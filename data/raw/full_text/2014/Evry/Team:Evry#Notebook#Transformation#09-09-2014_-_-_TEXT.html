Transformation of Pseudovrbrio with pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 - Confirmation
The previous digestion could fail because of the too little time of incubation (15min). We re-try to make the digestion with an incubation of 1 hour.
Gel of digestion with XbaI (2)
There was a problem with the digestion. We are going to try with another enzyme.
Stock of pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2
To remake a stock of these plasmids, we showed a colony of E.Coli transformed in a new LB 1X + Cam (1:1000) culture of 3mL.
