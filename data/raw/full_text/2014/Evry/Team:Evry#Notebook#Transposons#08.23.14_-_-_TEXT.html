Universal Plasmid
We decided to create a new Universal Transposon Plasmid. For this we designed some primers to amplified OriVR6Kgamma, the transposas Tn10 in the format biobrick, to amplified OriVR6Kgamma transposas and the 2 Is10 to build the Universal plasmid with Golden Gate method.
First it is necessary to muted the site XbaI in the Orivr6kgamma. For this the method of PCR mutagenes is used. For this the primer is designed to amplified all the plasmid.
The site Xba I : 5' TCTAGA 3'  is modified by 5' ACTAGA 3'
