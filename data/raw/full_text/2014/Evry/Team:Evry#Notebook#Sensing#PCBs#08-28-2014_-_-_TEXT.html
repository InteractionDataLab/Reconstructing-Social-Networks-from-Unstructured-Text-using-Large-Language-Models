Sensor construction bphR2/PbpR1
PCR colony has been done with colonies of the transformation bphR2 in pSB1C3. The tail expected was 1242bp and we obtained it:
A nanodrop has been done on the colony 1 (48ng/µl) and colony 2 (4&,4ng/µl) and the colony has been send to sequencing
With PCR clean up of each part, golden gate has been done. Volumes for each part has been calculated with cloning bench application.
Mix DNA contains:
J23114-RBS (82,1ng/µl):0,06 µl
bphR2 (139,3 ng/µl) : 0,327µl
bphR1 (101,1ng/µl): 0,21µl
RFP (75,3 ng/µl): 0,46µl
Terminator (28,1ng/µl) : 0,37µl
pSB1C3,G3 (107,2ng/µl) : 0,93µl
Mix enzyme contains:
1,5µl 10X T4 ligase buffer
0,5µl BSAI
0,5µl T4 ligase
2,5µl
