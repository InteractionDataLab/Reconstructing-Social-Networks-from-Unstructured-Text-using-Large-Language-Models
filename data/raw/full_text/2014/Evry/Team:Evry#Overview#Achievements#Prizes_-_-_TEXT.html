iGEM prizes
Environmental track
- Real-time monitoring with a bioactive filtration system, a sponge and its microbiome.
- Design with the aim not to introduce a new species in a fragile ecosystem.
- Environnementaly safe design, not transferrable to descendance.
- Working on an organism people know and are confortable with: the "bath sponge".
Best measurement
- Participation to the Interlab Study working not only on the 3 mandatory genetic devices but also the 18 promoters from Anderson’s library.
- Designed a phenol biosensor able to detect phenol at lower concentrations than previous teams.
Best Policy & Practices Advance
- Extensive report of our philosophical reflexion on the contrast between the ambitions of synthetic biology (rigorous designs) and the reality (trial, error and kludges), which we conducted over the summer.
- Debate on the ethical questions raised by the modification of an animal's microbiome, and by the use of an animal as a bioremediation tool in potentially toxic areas.
- Reflexion about the risks inherent to the release of genetically modified organisms in seawater, and on the possibility and efficiency of epibiosis as a biological containment.
Best New Basic Part
- Bring Transposons Tn10 to the iGEM competition, giving a chance to other teams to develop a project in a wider range of chassis.
