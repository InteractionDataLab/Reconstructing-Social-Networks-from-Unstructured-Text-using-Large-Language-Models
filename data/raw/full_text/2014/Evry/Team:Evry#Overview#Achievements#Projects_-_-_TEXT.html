Projects Achievements
Chassis characterization
- Genome Sequencing of Pseudovibrio denitrificans to collect informations defense mechanisms,
transposons putative insertion localisation and to possess a assembled genome for RNAseq.
- Growth conditions optimization
- Antibiotic sensitivity tests shown a potential resistance to tetracycline and ampicilline
- Electroporation Transformation protocol establishment that never been done before
New Vector
- Transposon-based vector was created to overcome resistance mechanisms to DNA entrance
- Proof of concept to use it in Pseudovibrio denitrificans was achieved
New or Optimized sensors Sensors
- New PCB sensor based on bphR1 promoter and binding protein bphR2.
- An optimized version of the Phenol sensors from Pekin iGEM 2013 team was constructed
- RNA-seq data shall be used to find new promoters
