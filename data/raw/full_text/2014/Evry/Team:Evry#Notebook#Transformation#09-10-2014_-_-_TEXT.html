Transformation of Pseudovrbrio with pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2 - Confirmation
A contamination has been shown in another transformation test. We can't use our previous results because there is a chance that it's not Pseudovibrio but the contamination which had been transformed. We can still try to prove that it's our bacteria (with amplification of specific sequence) ond that there is our plasmids.
New transformation was tried with another stock of competent Pseudovibrio ( Protocole ) and cells were plated on MB/MB+Cam(1:1000)/MB+Kan(1:1000).
Stock of pBBR1MCS and pRhokHI-2
The colony of E.Coli transformed in LB 1X + Cam (1:1000) culture of 3mL was sowed on new LB/LB+Cam(1:1000)/LB+Kan(1:1000) plates and incubated with shaking overnight at 37°C.
