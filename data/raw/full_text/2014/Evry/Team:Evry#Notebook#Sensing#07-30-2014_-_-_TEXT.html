Survivability in molecules which are going to be sensed - Results:
Here are the results of the survivability of Pseudovibrio in media with molecules which are going to be sensed:
Pseudovibrio seems to survive in presence of all concentrations of nitrite, it's affect cells' growth but don't kill Pseudovibrio.
In Lead, big concentrations lead to cells' death, but Pseudovibrio survive very well until a concentration of 5µL.
Cadmium does'nt seem to block cells' growth in concentrations which we want to use.
