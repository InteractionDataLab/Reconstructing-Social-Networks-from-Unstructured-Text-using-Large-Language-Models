Sensor construction bphR2/PbpR1
We wanted to assemble the construction by using golden gate. After to have received primers, PCR was done  to amplify J23114-RBS, bphR2, bphR1-RBS, RFP and terminator with golden gate primers. The tail of each part is:
J23114-RBS = 82bp
bphR2 mutated = 929bp
bphR1-RBS = 340bp
RFP = 732bp
Terminator = 162bp
Simultaneously, the product of digestion of bphR2 and pSB1C3 has been migrated to verify the digestion then, bphR2 and pSB1C3 has been ligated and we have done a heat shock transformation.
