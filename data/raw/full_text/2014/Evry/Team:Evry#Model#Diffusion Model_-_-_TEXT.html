Introduction
PCB pollution have been identify as a major problem in the ocean [link to overview]. In our project, we wanted to tackle this issue by using a sensing device integrated into a synbiotic bacteria of sponge [link to description]. This approach raise few questions:
How does our device behave in presence of PCB?
What are the lowest or highest PCB concentration detectable?
Considering the symbiosis with the sponge, how could our device be disturbed?
