From 2014.igem.org
Sensor construction bphR2/PbphR1 :
Miniprep of pSB1C3 was done => 68,9ng/µl and the plasmid was digested with EcoRI-HF and pstI.
Digestion products of pSB1C3 and bphr2 has been migrated on gel 1X agarosis. Bands expected were:
for pSB1C3: one band at 2069bp (vector) and one band at 1070bp (insert)
for bphr2: one band at 946 pb (insert) and one band at 1300bp (vector)
We obtained the good bands so an extraction on gel was done to recover only pSB1C3 without its insert and only bphr2 gene.
