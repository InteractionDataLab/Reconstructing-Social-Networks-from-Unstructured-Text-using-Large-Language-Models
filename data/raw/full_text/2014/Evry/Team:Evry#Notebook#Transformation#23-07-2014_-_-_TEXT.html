Construction of a new plasmid - Choice and amplification of the ORI
PCR with
primers 49 and 50 (see primers table in Protocols )
Q5 high fidelity enzyme
TM=60°C.
Migration of the PCR products, we have two bands per well.
Figure: Result of ORI amplification in Pseudovibrio denitrificans (Pd), Pseudovribrio ascidiaceicola (Pa) and E.coli DH5a.
The negative control with E.coli DH5a confirms that there is no amplification. For Pseudovibrio strains, we obtain one band for Pseudovibrio denitrificans and two for Pseudovibrio ascidiaceicola.
