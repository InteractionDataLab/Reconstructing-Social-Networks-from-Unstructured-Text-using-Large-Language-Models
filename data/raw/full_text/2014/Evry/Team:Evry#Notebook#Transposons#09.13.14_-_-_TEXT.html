Golden Gate Tn10
Some white colonies transformed with pSB1C3 (RFC92) Tn10 is sowed. A PCR with primers VF and VR is realized.
gel There is 2 bands or 300bp or 1600bp. The first band corresponding to plasmid empty and the second band corresponding to plasmid with Tn10. So it is my construction.
The plasmid is purified and send to sequence with primer VF VR.
