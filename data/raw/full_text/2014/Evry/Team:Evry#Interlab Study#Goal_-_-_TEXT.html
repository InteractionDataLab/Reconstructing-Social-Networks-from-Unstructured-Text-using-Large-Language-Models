Team:Evry/Interlab Study/Goal
From 2014.igem.org
The goal of the interlab study is to obtain fluorescence data for three specific genetic devices expressing GFP from the iGEM teams all around the world. This will permit to observe the result repeatability across technics, strains and teams.
The study is also extended to the entire Anderson library of constitutive prokaryotic promoters (J23100 to J23119) .   This library corresponds to 19 constitutive promoters containing some nucleotide mutations on the -35 and the -10, as shown figure x. The idea is to compare the expression strength of promoters according to mutations, from the maximum amount of fluorescence data in order to have significant results.
Anderson collection promoter sequences and mutations.
To test the expression of promoters, they are cloned into the PSB1C3 vector followed by the BBa_E0240, a GFP generator. Constructions are inserted in E. coli DH5 alpha that grown on LB medium added with the selection agent, chloramphenicol. Our team decided to test the fluorescence with a TECAN infiniteM200 in 96 well plates.
