iGEM was a great way for me to end my Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and Food Engineering. I've learned a lot (mostly from my own stupid mistakes) and had fun. When I'm not in the lab transforming bacteria, I enjoy mountain biking and playing board games. I really don't have a clue what I'm going to do once iGEM is over. I'll probably spend lots of time with my husband who I've barely seen since iGEM took over my summer.

I've just now finished my Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc.) and will be starting my career as a food engineer. The iGEM competition gave me the chance to be creative and learn many new skills. I've discovered my strengths and weaknesses and have proved to myself that I can be a team player and can also lead a team

I've just finished my Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc.) and these days, I'm starting my Master's degree in Medical Science (M.Sc.). Joining the iGEM competition taught me a lot about research and synthetic biology but above all, I learned about myself, how to be a great team member and to utilize myself to achieve our wishful goals.

Haveing finished my bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc.) I've started my studies at the Technion's graduate school. The essence of the iGEM competition for me is the development and establishment of a startup company. Besides lab work and science knowledge, it gave me the tools of marketing and the chance to believe in an idea and push it forward to success.

I just finished my bachelor's degree in Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc) and will begin my research in drug delivery. When working on our project in the iGEM competition I learned many things about myself and about interacting in a group. I met some amazing people, whom I wouldn't get to know otherwise and I'm grateful for this amazing experience. PS I also found out I was too clumsy for those tiny PCR tubes.

I've just finished my last year as a Bachelor's student of Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc.) and I'm going to start my Masters's degree in a few months. While working on the iGEM project I have learned many new things about Synthetic Biology and the world of research  in general. The project was a great challenge for me but I'm really glad for the chance to experience it.

I'm about to finish my undergraduate studies in the department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc.). To me, iGEM was a sobering experience: it meant peeking out of the undergraduate crib, and catching a glimpse of the real world. Apart from the scientific facet (brainstorming, working in the lab) I've learned a lot about my own abilities. Instead of trying to match up to other peoples' skills, I learned how to identify and harness my own unique strengths (such as my crazy imagination!), while conquering my weaknesses. Another important thing that I learned, is how to work as part of a team (each team member has his own unique perceptions and ideas)- while enjoying the company of some great minds! I am truly grateful for this experience!

I have just finished my undergraduate studies in the department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering (B.Sc.).  Currently, I am starting my graduate studies in the field of microbiology and quantitative Biology (M.Sc.) at the Technion's department of Biology. iGEM gave me the opportunity to undergo a full study process, from defining  a problem, to designing a solution  as well as modeling and working in the lab. During my participation in iGEM I have discovered the great potential of combining quantitative studies with traditional and innovative biological methods.

Hello, I'm a fourth year student at the Technion Institute of Technology, I am studying Biochemical Engineering and Chemistry Science. I am fascinated by engineering-science interplay. I decided to join the iGEM competition because I felt that this would be the only chance I would get in my B.Sc. career to prove that the combination between nano-chemistry and synthetic biology can lead to solving critical problems that would not be able to be solved by these fields separately. Apart from my educational interests, I would like to play an important role in a comeback of Breaking Bad  and to make some "safe" chemistry stuff.

You know nothing [about me], Jon Snow, so keep reading... I have just now finished my bachelor's degrees in Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science. Through the iGEM competition, I have gained important experience in independent research, as well as in teamwork and collaboration. I have also had the chance to learn a completely new field (Biotechnology) on my own, and to implement some of my ideas in this field. Also, I really like Game of Thrones, so: Mathematics is coming. A Physicist always pays his debts. Family, Duty, Computer Science.

I might only be finishing my second year of my Bachelor's degree in Physics (B.Sc.) now, but thanks to the iGEM competition I had the chance to get my hands dirty in various advanced topics such as bio-physical statistics, computational physics and developing and testing my own physical models. My passion for learning and experiencing new fields of knowledge is what led me to participate in iGEM and thanks to this amazing opportunity I completely fell in love with synthetic biology!

The Synthetic Biology Laboratory for the Decipherment of Genomic Codes
Roee Amit, Department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering, Technion
Dr Amit's group is focused on constructing "Synthetic Enhancer Circuits" for a variety of applications and research objectives.
The group's primary purpose is to decipher basic enhancer design principles using a variety of microscopy, molecular engineering, and theoretical approaches,
including new synthetic biology tools developed in the lab.
Dr. Roee Amit
Assistant Professor
Dr Amit received his undergraduate degree in Applied and Engineering Physics from Cornell University in 1994. After a short a stint in the IDF, he carried out his graduate studies on the interactions of proteins and DNA at the single molecule level in the Weizmann Institute of Science under the supervision of Prof. Joel Stavans, completing his Ph.D in 2004. In 2006, he moved to Caltech, where he specialized in Synthetic Biology working as a post-doctoral scholar in collaboration with Prof. Scott Fraser, Frances Arnold, and Rob Phillips. In 2011, Dr Amit returned to Israel with a Senior Lecturer (Assistant Professor) appointment to start the Technion's first Synthetic Biology research lab.
Dr. Orna Atar
Lab manager
I'm the lab manager in Roee Amit's lab. I have a PhD in human molecular genetics and biochemistry from the Sackler Faculty of Medicine in Tel Aviv University. I love the concept of iGEM, doing your own research so early in your science career! Synthetic biology is the coolest thing in biology – being able to play with all the knowledge gained until now and create new tools for better understanding biology and creating new applications is FUN!
Inbal Vaknin
I'm a M.Sc student in the lab. My main interest is gene regulation in yeast. As part of my M.Sc, I'm working on expressing bacterial genes in yeast for the purpose of innovative gene regulation inside the yeast's nucleus. I recieved my B.Sc degree from the Biotechnology and Food engineering Faculty in the Technion. Disclosure about myself: In 2013, I participated in the iGEM contest and I was a part of the very first team from the Technion (and so in Israel), which was my first experience in the fascinating synthetic biology world.
Lior Levy
I'm a Master student in the lab, I received my B.Sc from the faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering at the Technion. I was part of the first iGEM group from the Technion (and Israel) and now I'm one of the new iGEM team mentor. I'm interested in Two Component Systems and especially how to use them in order to make novelty synthetic biology circuits. On my spare time I like to dub cartoons and narrate everything I read.
Michal Brunwasser
I’m a PhD student in the lab and I’m interested in many aspects of synthetic biology. Currently I’m working on synthetic bacterial enhancers in order to gain insight on the regulatory code encoded within natural enhancers. I received my B.Sc. in Life Sciences from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in 2006 and my M.Sc. degree in Biology from the Technion in 2010.
Noa Katz
I received my first degree summa cum laude from the Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering in the Technion, and went straight to a PhD degree, as a part of the special doctorate program. I'm interested in many aspects of synthetic biology, mainly because of its engineering-like approach to biology; such as the reprogramming of cells that can cause them to re-grow a tissue, or to act as an analytic micro-robot. In order to know how to program living cells, the way we do electrical components, we need to understand how certain processes in biology actually work. Currently, I’m working on the transcription characterization and the creation of RNA-protein structures in vivo. On a more personal note, I like to read, play chess, and eat vanilla flavored pancakes.
