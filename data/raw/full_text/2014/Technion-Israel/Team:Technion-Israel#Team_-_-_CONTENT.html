To me, iGEM was a sobering experience: it meant peeking out of the undergraduate crib, and catching a glimpse of the real world. Apart from the scientific facet (brainstorming, working in the lab) I've learned a lot about my own abilities.
Instead of trying to match up to other peoples' skills, I learned how to identify and harness my own unique strengths (such as my crazy imagination!), while conquering my weaknesses. Another important thing that I learned, is how to work as part of a team (each team member has his own unique perceptions and ideas)- while enjoying the company of some great minds!

I decided to join the iGEM competition because I felt that this would be the only chance I would get in my B.Sc. career to prove that the combination between nano-chemistry and synthetic biology can lead to solving critical problems that would not be able to be solved by these fields separately.

I have just now finished my bachelor's degrees in Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science. Through the iGEM competition, I have gained important experience in independent research, as well as in teamwork and collaboration. I have also had the chance to learn a completely new field (Biotechnology) on my own, and to implement some of my ideas in this field. Also, I really like Game of Thrones, so:

In order to know how to program living cells, the way we do electrical components, we need to understand how certain processes in biology actually work. Currently, Iâm working on the transcription characterization and the creation of RNA-protein structures in vivo. On a more personal note, I like to read, play chess, and eat vanilla flavored pancakes.</P></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="wrapper style2"><DIV class="title" id="gallery">Gallery</DIV></DIV><DIV id="copyright"><UL><LI><A href="https://www.facebook.com/iGEM2014.Technion" target="_blank">Visit our Facebook page</A></LI><LI>Â© All rights reserved</LI><LI>Design: <A href="http://html5up.net" target="_blank">HTML5 UP</A>&amp; Technion_Israel Team</LI><LI>igem14il@gmail.com</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
