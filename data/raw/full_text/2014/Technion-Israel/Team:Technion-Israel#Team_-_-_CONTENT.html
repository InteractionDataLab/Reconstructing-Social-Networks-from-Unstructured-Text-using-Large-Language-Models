To me, iGEM was a sobering experience: it meant peeking out of the undergraduate crib, and catching a glimpse of the real world. Apart from the scientific facet (brainstorming, working in the lab) I've learned a lot about my own abilities.
Instead of trying to match up to other peoples' skills, I learned how to identify and harness my own unique strengths (such as my crazy imagination!), while conquering my weaknesses. Another important thing that I learned, is how to work as part of a team (each team member has his own unique perceptions and ideas)- while enjoying the company of some great minds!

I decided to join the iGEM competition because I felt that this would be the only chance I would get in my B.Sc. career to prove that the combination between nano-chemistry and synthetic biology can lead to solving critical problems that would not be able to be solved by these fields separately.

I have just now finished my bachelor's degrees in Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science. Through the iGEM competition, I have gained important experience in independent research, as well as in teamwork and collaboration. I have also had the chance to learn a completely new field (Biotechnology) on my own, and to implement some of my ideas in this field. Also, I really like Game of Thrones, so:

In order to know how to program living cells, the way we do electrical components, we need to understand how certain processes in biology actually work. Currently, I’m working on the transcription characterization and the creation of RNA-protein structures in vivo. On a more personal note, I like to read, play chess, and eat vanilla flavored pancakes.</P></SECTION></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="wrapper style2"><DIV class="title" id="gallery">Gallery</DIV></DIV><DIV id="copyright"><UL><LI><A href="https://www.facebook.com/iGEM2014.Technion" target="_blank">Visit our Facebook page</A></LI><LI>© All rights reserved</LI><LI>Design: <A href="http://html5up.net" target="_blank">HTML5 UP</A>&amp; Technion_Israel Team</LI><LI>igem14il@gmail.com</LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
