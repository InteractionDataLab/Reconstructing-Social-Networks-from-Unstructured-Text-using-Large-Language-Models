Results
The Project
We are developing a low concentration bio-detector.
The system is based on an intricate gate construct,                     utilizes quorum-sensing and an altered two-component signalling system.                     In addition, groundbreaking organic synthesis of a photo-switching molecule – Azobenzene –      is used in a pioneering attempt to mimic biofilm formation.
We have planned and built a low concentration detector using these elements.

Policy & Practices
In our Policy & Practices project we focus on 3 principles:
Encouraging independent thinking and creativity among teens and youth
Progressing Arab-Jewish relations through the medium of science
Representing Israel as ambassadors in the international iGEM competition
SynBio in 3 Languages
All of our Policy & Practices activities are related to our main concept of SynBio in 3 languages. Each activity was designed to include all members of Israeli society.

iGEM High Schools
We have launched the first iGEM High School team in Israel! We designed detaild lesson plans and found facilities for the project. The first group will start working for the 2015 competition.

SynBio Lectures
We have created detailed lesson plans including slideshows for children of all ages about Synthetic Biology in space and in water.  We used these lesson plans for our activities and they are available for your free use.

Collaborations
In the iGEM spirit we collaborated with the Paris_Bettencourt team on a few projects including a weekly newsletter, and with BGU_Israel on an experiment.
