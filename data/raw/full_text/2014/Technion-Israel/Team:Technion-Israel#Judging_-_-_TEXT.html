Results
The basic system is comprised of three gates which have been individually tested and found to be functional.  Gate 1 (alpha system) works and produces AHL. Gate 2 (alpha system) works and produces LuxR. The original Gate 3 was problematic to construct, however, the alternative Gate 2 – Gate 3 worked and showed a response to AHL.  The next stage would be to test the gates together to determine if the system can operate as a whole. The characterization of the Taz construct indicated that the two-component-signaling system has potential to function as a sensor for substances to be detected.
Further experimentation on the RNA splint is required to determine its functionality.  We succeeded in using azobenzene to make the bacteria aggregate, forming a synthetic biofilm.  From the results we obtained so far, we are optimistic that out system has potential to operate as a low-concentration biosensor.
