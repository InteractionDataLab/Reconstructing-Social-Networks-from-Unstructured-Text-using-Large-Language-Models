Matthew is going into his 4th year of Life Sciences at Queen’s University. In his natural habitat, Matthew can often be found hunkered in the lab running gels between the hours of 12am-5am, the most productive time of the the day for him. Matt has often been mistaken for a K-pop star thanks to his oh-so-flippable bangs and his slim-fit denim.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Emily is going into her 3rd year of Chemical Engineering this fall. She is a very cheery individual with a love affair with culinary experiments. She dreams of riding a giant turtle across the seven seas in order to become one with the natural world.</TD></TR><TR><TD>
Denisha is going into her 3rd year of Life Sciences this fall at Queen’s. Her strength is equivalent to 2 small possums, and she has sass that goes for miles. Although she is constantly frigid to the touch she has no cold tolerance whatsoever. Due to this, and her love of basking in the sun, we are confident in the fact that she is most likely cold blooded.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Rishad is going into his 4th year of Life Sciences. Aside from harassing Yuming, his other hobbies include eating a plethora of root vegetables and dazzling the team with his sleek oxfords and nautical-themed shorts. He also enjoys listening to the Pussycat dolls and pursuing fabulous hair, even though this is simply a pipe dream.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Annie recently graduated from undergraduate studies in Life Sciences and is the coolest advisor in town. Being with QGEM for the last 4 years, she is widely known for being the oldest, wisest and prettiest of the team with a dash of sass. She is an avid foodie and chronicles her foodventures in her urbanspoon-recognized blog. She owns a unicorn farm and will be studying the pharmacological properties of unicorn blood next year for her graduate degree.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Adrina is going into her 4th year of Life Sciences in the fall. She is a big fan of drinking copious amounts of tea and an aspiring poet/artist. This is her first time working with QGEM, and she’s finding it rewarding in so many ways and excited to see where the project takes her!</TD></TR><TR><TD>Yuming is going into his 3rd year of Life Sciences at Queen’s University. He has a great sense of humor and is known very fondly as “Mingerrrr” by his team members. He enjoys basking in his own masculinity and is tall, dark and handsome.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Jon is going into his 4th year of LIfe Sciences this fall. Widely known as a gentle giant, Jon spends most of his time wondering if the other team members (Denisha) will survive the night. He also finds great joy in watching sunsets and contemplating the greater meaning in life.</TD></TR><TR><TD>Matthew is going into his 3rd year of Engineering Chemistry this fall. He is renowned for his sharp jaw bone structure, which is known to cause daily traffic accidents due to astounded drivers staring at him in awe.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><LI id="Official Team Profile" class="animation"><A href="https://igem.org/Team.cgi?year=2014">OFFICIAL TEAM PROFILE</A></LI><DIV class="printfooter">
