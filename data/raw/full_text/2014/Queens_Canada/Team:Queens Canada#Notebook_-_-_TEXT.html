Through work over the summer the QGEM team documented the preliminary parts for the mitochondrial project. The parts were developed as a proof of concept, in order to test the transport of hydrophobic proteins across a hydrophilic membrane. Rather than using a mitochondrial protein, GFP was used for easy characterization. Future steps include characterization of the parts. This would be testing the effectiveness of the intein in E.coli, as well as its efficiency using time-course Western Blots. Following preliminary characterizations, the part would be transferred in a shuttle vector into Yeast where assays would determine the effectiveness of the entry into the mitochondria. Below is a block illustration of the parts characterized. If you would like to see our parts on the parts wiki, please follow this links: His-tagged split GFP w/ MTS N-terminal GFP w/ an N-terminal Intein
