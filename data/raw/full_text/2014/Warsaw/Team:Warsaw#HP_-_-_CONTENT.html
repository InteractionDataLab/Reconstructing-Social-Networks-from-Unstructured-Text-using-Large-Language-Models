We have a vision to transform our dreams in new applications to excel in  achieving social goals.  Our vision for Human Practice has been  shown in report on Future Lanthan Hospital Model. It is a bottom-up strategy  to transform healthcare by launching collaboration on the boundaries of several disciplines aimed at inducing openness and sharing, not only in business and academia but also in the society itself. In Human Practice we would like to show the perspective and context for Cellulare. To tell the truth we would be pleased show you big dreams with application and encourage you to collaborate with us! 

</P><P align="justify">  We  believe that the person with a great idea behind is more powerful than one who depend merely on facts. So, everything what we have done was based on that philosophy. We do not give you complete solutions,  but a vision and a strategy to develop and apply. Our first goal is not to be the best iGEM project, our goal is to initiate the project which could be developed further, outside iGEM by people of different skills and different potential  to solve complex problems on the larger scale. We are aimed at  design both Cellulare itself and its Human Practice to serve social goals which could be developed far beyond synthetic biology.

This is how new application for Celulare  has emerged. Our ultimate goal of the Human Practice is to add valuable contribution to healthcare transition by proposing a more synthetic biology-oriented approach for medicine. At the same time we want to encourage you to become more resource-efficient through optimal allocation of scarce material. We would like to show new application for mechanism design (engineering part of the economics) and the stable matching algorithm allowing to better resource-management addressing the needs of the patients. We also aim to provide a contribution to the processing of medical data and open source science in the era of big data in medicine. Here, we see new application for Celulare, (and in futher perspective iGEM itself) to finally bring idea of transform healthcare with synthetic biology.

This year, as we continue our HP long term strategy, we
developed an educational
computer game. We are willing to use it to popularize synthetic biology term and our
CeLuLa-Re project. The game was written in HTML5 using Construct2 software.<A href="https://f6052cc3a5c084cb37f0b0f1639e817316d820f5.googledrive.com/host/0ByxTljcJDMLoLVlGVzc5OGVURnM/">Here</A> you will find a link to an external server
The game is actually a demo as we plan to develop it. We believe we can reach and
attract many people as the game is funny and everybody learns best, while playing.<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H8yeYqBvqo">Here</A> is a short film showing gameplay</P><P align="justify">The game consists of 3 platform levels and 2 quizzes about our project. At the
beginning the two levels are locked as the player proceeds after collecting particular
amount of lanthanides ions. You can especially earn
a lot of them by giving correct
answers in quiz.
Platform levels are full of arcade challenges such
as deadly spikes or enemies
making it hard to reach
ions. Both quizzes consist of 10 questions about synthetic
biology, rare earths elements, our wet lab and HP part. All the correct answers can
be found
on our
Wiki
and on the official
iGEM webpage.
The main hero is a genetically engineered bacteria
which wants to return home. Its
space ship was destroyed due to collision with space rubbish. Now the bacteria
searches a dangerous
and unknown land for lacking lanthanides ions to build a laser
to clear the planet's atmosphere and repair its space ship so it can safely return
home.</P><P align="justify">Well, that is the demo. We have loads of other ideas to expand the game such as
gaining super powers by hero when obtaining special
BioBrick, different types of
enemies and obstacles, new levels
and of course we plan on adding
more
educational value. We are planning to create a book
of knowledge and make a
drag&amp;drop task to teach cloning in BioBrick standard.
We are inviting you to play and share
this
game with your friends!</P><P align="justify"> In our persuits we have been inspired by  and support mutually with <A href="http://www.ci.edu.pl/en/collegium/idea "> Collegium Invisibile  </A> and <A href="http://offtopicarium.wikidot.com/en:about"> Offtopicarium  </A>who also realize some bottom-up initiatives and have excellent Human Practice.

The basic idea behind Lanthan Hospital Model is to integrate synthetic biology lab with hospital. This is sort of start-up strategy with systems impact, which we set in the context of a broader healthcare transformation. As Celulare is focused on lanthanides bioremediation, we want to propose strategy to optimal allocation of these elements and other deficit resources on healthcare market. That is why we have indicated several possible applications for novel economic concepts of Nobel Prize Winners in ‘Nobel Lantan Economy and Nobel Human Practice’ section. We believe that synthetic biology approach, especially iGEM itself may &quot;influence the world from protein, to policy, to pixels.” To make it happen we develop Future Lantan Hospital Model.

Rapid developments in deep sequencing, metabolomics and so called &quot;personal medicine&quot; have already changed medical sciences. Hence, we would like to add a valuable contribution to that healthcare transition by proposing a more synthetic biology-oriented approach for medicine. Our project ‘Cellulare’ touches both healthcare transformation for data analysis and optimal allocation of deficit resources. Our question is how to design a hospital only having access to limited resources, equip it in modern technologies (biomedical and IT), and finally how to combine modern technology and pro-ecological design in order to improve the work of healthcare. To address this difficult issue, we developed Future Lanthan Hospital Model, which is aimed to show that recovery of lanthanides (rare earth elements) from electronic waste  (smartphones, tablets etc.) by synthetic biology methods, could be a beneficial supporting strategy for a modern hospital. We have proposed integration of a hospital with a supplementary synthetic biology lab,  in which lanthanide remediation project could take place. First, such a solution would contribute to the public image of the hospital as a rationally functioning  institution with  eco-friendly profile. Secondly, it could allow to equip the hospital in modern technologies based on rare-earth metals. Simultaneously, we suggest mechanism design (engineering part of the economy) and the stable matching algorithm allowing better resource-management that would address the needs of the patients. By Future Lanthan Hospital Model we would like to show beneficial changes for society resulted from implementation of modern technologies in medicine  and  educate people about  applications, safety and some security problems related to cutting-edge technologies. In the end we also aim to provide a contribution to the processing of medical data and open source science, since in the era of big data in medicine such measures seems to be necessary for the rapid transformation of the healthcare. </P><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Warsaw/Project"><H6>Up↑</H6></A><H2>Collaboration and future perspectives </H2><FONT size="4"><P align="left"><I>We have a bright vision of the future so we start from collaboration and sharing. </I></P></FONT><H3> Science Polish Perspectives </H3><P align="justify">We are extremely proud that just before Giant Jamboree we have passed through competitive selection process  for talks and we are to present Future Lanthan Hospital Model at the <A href="http://www.polishperspectives.org/en/home-en"> Science Polish Perspectives 2014 at Oxford</A>!  One of main aim of conference is to popularise science, whilst also enhancing the cooperation between its British, Polish and European branches.  Taking in mind  SPP agenda we hope that presenting our project help us to build a network of contacts and discuss Poland’s participation in the development of science and technology. We  agree with the agenda that drawing  inspiration from each other is one of the best ways of developing the huge potential as individuals and as members of a fast-growing scientific community.

Members of  iGEM Warsaw Team, ‘Leaders of healthcare market’ program and Collegium Invisibile wish to contribute to educational initiatives, hence our long term goal is to build a group of passionate young people who will continue spreading our ideas in the future. In these particular cases we feel an obligation to help in STEM education in medicine and to find some future leaders to take care of Lanthan Hospital Model. We also hope to perform several analyses related to our project in cooperation between iGEM team and members mentioned organizations. See annex 4 in the report 'Celulare - future leaders start here'.

We aimed at spread the idea of Future Lanthan Hospital and potential applications of lanthanides, as we thinking of our long term goals from the beginning - we want  our project Celulare  to have real application and meet people needs.   Together with  members of Collegium Invisibile we prepared workshops introducing idea of Future Lanthan Hospital and simultaneously fascinating young people with synthetic biology and showing idea of startups. We also prepared workshops on advanced visualization in oncology (molecular imaging, MRI) to show applications on lanthanides in medicine and collaboration on the boundaries of science. 
</P><H6>Up↑</H6><H3> Offtopicarium</H3><P align="justify">  As we have discovered that Offtopicarium gives unique opportunity to present our project to people from different fields: scientists, entrepreneurs, people involved in startups, who like to discuss, create and solve problems and are not afraid of unconventional and &quot;off-topic&quot; ideas, we wanted to contribute to this event by being active participants and by preparing supporting materials(see Figure 2). Important to say is that one of our members  has coorganized the event this year with a view to mutually spread ideas between iGEM Team and Offtopicarium community (for more information on Offtopicarium see <A href="http://crastina.se/5th-offtopicarium-in-poland-26-28-sept-2014-apply/ "> article </A> in  Scientia Crastina).</P><P align="center"><B> Figure 2. </B> Event cover  - supporting materials prepared by the member of IGEM Warsaw Team 2014. </P><P align="justify">  Offtopicarium has been launched to spread ideas among people with passion, so we prepared comprehensive presentation of ideas related to our project in three talks. First talk titled &quot;Synthetic life - beyond biology and chemistry&quot; briefly summarized the recent discoveries and development in biological chemistry which are connected to the idea of synthetic life such as new synthetic analogues of DNA, extended genetic code and so called bioorthogonal chemistry which allow us to introduce chemical modifications to proteins, nucleic acids and other biomolecules <I>in vivo</I>. Second  talk “Serious games in Education – was related to  computer game connected with Celulare  - game that would teach synthetic biology. It was also a story on ventures with starting up a small game-design company. The last talk, titled “How to make healthcare more open? How to allocate resources in healthcare? - are those mirror questions?”  presented Future Lanthan Hospital Model in the context of open health. This was a talk on the possibilities and  problems encountered in spreading  ideas in context of society awareness, medical environemnent and lack of economical and law analysis.  </P><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Warsaw/Project"><H6>Up↑</H6></A><A name="science_festival"><H2>Science Festival</H2></A><P align="justify">At the end of September our iGEM Team took part in Festiwal Nauki (Science Festival)– an annual event held all over Warsaw, organized since 1997. The aim of the Festival is to talk, show and share science with the entire society, to gain social endorsement for further progress of science in Poland. It is also an opportunity for anyone to do science on their own – by taking part in discussions, lectures, workshops, shows and many more events held every day for 10 days.  
As a Team, we prepared two things for this occasion: workshop called “Design your own gene” and a stand devoted to synthetic biology and recycling. On our stand we were showing in simple ways what is synthetic biology and what we can do with it. We were also talking about our project, showing that not only bacteria can be used for recycling, but that it is also possible to use some basic trash to create something useful or pretty – like newspaper baskets or crayon boxes from milk containers. Most of our listeners there where young children. 
The bioinformatics workshop was dedicated to older listeners, who already knew a little about biology. We were trying to show them what synthetic biology is and how the process of genetical engineering really looks like. Listeners where given a basic program that would show them if the sequence created by them will work as a gene.  
This event was a very important part of our Human Practice, where we could meet our target people face-to-face. Overall, Science Festival was a great experience for us and an amazing way to meet and talk with people about synthetic biology and our project. Both children and adults seemed fascinated by the idea of bacteria recycling lanthanides and many people said they are looking forward to see our project become everyday reality.</P><H6>Up↑</H6><A name="media"><H2>Media</H2></A><H3>Media mentions</H3><P align="leftt"><OL type="1"><LI><A href="http://www.naukawpolsce.pap.pl/aktualnosci/news,401374,bezpieczne-bakterie-pomoga-w-odzyskiwaniu-rzadkich-metali.html">Polish Press Agency</A></LI><LI><A href="http://www.biol.uw.edu.pl/pl/aktualnosci/196-wiadomosci/1588-druzyna-igem-warsaw-team">Department of Biology</A></LI><LI><A href="http://wawalove.pl/Bakterie-z-Uniwersytetu-Warszawskiego-pomoga-w-recyklingu-smartfonow-a14442">&quot;Wawa Love&quot; web site</A></LI><LI><A href="http://laboratoria.net/pdf/?get=L2FrdHVhbG5vc2NpL19pdGVtLDIxOTczLHJpZCwscHJpbnQsMSxwZGYsMS5odG1s">&quot;laboratoria.net&quot; web site</A></LI><LI><A href="http://portaltechniczny.pl/aktualnosci/pt/projekt-polskich-bakterii-odzyskujacych-pierwiastki-ziem-rzadkich.html">&quot;portaltechniczny.pl&quot; web site</A></LI><LI><A href="http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1019393,title,Bakterie-z-Uniwersytetu-Warszawskiego-pomoga-w-recyklingu-smartfonow,wid,16645457,wiadomosc.html?ticaid=113a3f">&quot;Wirtualna Polska&quot; web site</A></LI><LI><A href="http://www.focus.pl/przyroda/bakterie-z-uw-pomoga-w-recyklingu-smartfonow-11317">&quot;Focus&quot; magazine</A></LI><LI><A href="http://www.chip.pl/news/wydarzenia/nauka-i-technika/2014/06/studenci-z-uniwersytetu-warszawskiego-pracuja-nad-nowa-metoda-recyklingu-smartfonow?fb_action_ids=814772768533394&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes">&quot;Chip&quot; magazine</A></LI></OL></P><H6>Up↑</H6><DIV class="printfooter">
