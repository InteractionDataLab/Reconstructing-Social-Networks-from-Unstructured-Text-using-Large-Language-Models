The PmrA protein is a cognate response regulator of
the histidine kinase PmrB. Upon
phosphorylation by PmrB, PmrA undergoes dimerization which dramatically increases its affinity for
promoter DNA. This allows it to regulate expression
of a number of genes, usually coding for LPS-
modifying enzymes.
In our project, we used the PmrA unchanged, for it
to serve as an transcription inductor for our
reporter - the GFP, expressed under the control of the
PmrC promoter, i.e. the promoter of one of the
genes involved in LPS modification. Notably, however, there is no PmrC gene under its promoter
in our constructs, so that neither this LPS-modifyi
ng enzyme, nor any other enzymes of this kind, are
expressed. </P>

This part is extraordinarily long for a promoter. It is designed this way because of the ca. 400 bp spacer at 5' end of the part - promoter is only 46 bp long, which would prove almost impossible to amplify through PCR or direct synthesis and ligation with pSB1C3. To counter this, we amplified pmrC with this spacer.

PmrB(LBT) is a engineered PmrB gene, where PmrB is a sensor histidine kinase present in the inner cell membrane of many species of bacteria,
including
<I>E. coli</I> and <I>S. enterica</I>. With a 30 amino acid periplasmic loop, it is capable of binding iron
(III) and aluminium ions. The binding event induces
a conformational change of the protein, which
leads to ATP phosphate-derived autophosphorylation
of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain,
followed by transfer of the phosphate group onto the transcriptional regulator PmrA.
As part of our project, the periplasmic iron/alumin
ium-binding loop of the PmrB was substituted
with a synthetic sequence - a lanthanide-binding ta
g, intended to bind lanthanide ions, with terbium
in particular. Such a binding event would then induce the aforementioned conformation change and
phosphorylation of the PmrA, leading it to bind to
the PmrC promoter, to allow for expression of the
Green Fluorescent Protein - our reporter gene.

PmrB(LBT) is a engineered PmrB gene, where PmrB is a sensor histidine kinase present in the inner cell membrane of many species of bacteria,
including
<I>E. coli</I> and <I>S. enterica</I>. With a 30 amino acid periplasmic loop, it is capable of binding iron
(III) and aluminium ions. The binding event induces
a conformational change of the protein, which
leads to ATP phosphate-derived autophosphorylation
of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain,
followed by transfer of the phosphate group onto the transcriptional regulator PmrA.
As part of our project, the periplasmic iron/alumin
ium-binding loop of the PmrB was substituted
with a synthetic sequence - a lanthanide-binding ta
g, intended to bind lanthanide ions, with terbium
in particular. Such a binding event would then induce the aforementioned conformation change and
phosphorylation of the PmrA, leading it to bind to
the PmrC promoter, to allow for expression of the
Green Fluorescent Protein - our reporter gene. 

If you wish to study PmrA-PmrB system more closely, we suggest reading following papers:

This is pmrC promoter from <I>Salmonella enterica</I>, with subsequent GFP. This part is one part of PmrA-PmrB detecting system. Upon phosphorylation by PmrB, PmrA binds to pmrC and induces expression of GFP.
This part is extraordinary long for a pmr<SUP>C</SUP>-GFP. It is designed this way because of the ca. 400 bp spacer at 5' end of the part - promoter is only 46 bp long, which would prove almost impossible to amplify through PCR or direct synthesis and ligation with pSB1C3. To counter this, we amplified pmrC with this spacer.
This part contains also RBS from <I>Salmonella enterica</I>, just before the start of translation.

We did succed in constructing the lanthanide sensor
in BioBrick standard and cloning its parts into
pSB1C3 and sending seven of them to the Registry.
As for 17.10.2014, we are trying to measure pmr<SUP>C</SUP> not activated by PmrA and also we are trying to measure GFP expression both in presence and in absence of lanthanide ions in the environment.
We also measured the relative strenght of pmr<SUP>C</SUP> promoter in the absence of lanthanides.<H4>What would we do (given more time)</H4>
Given more time, we would certainly try to test more lanthanide binding tags and to construct a
system to effectively bind those ions, not only detect them. 
We would also try to quantify better our existing system. <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Warsaw/Project"><H6>Up↑</H6></A><A name="cooperation"><H2>Cooperation with other iGEM Teams</H2></A><H5>During this year’s iGEM we have exchanged with the following teams:</H5><P align="justify"><LI>Paris_Bettencourt – we participated in the iGEM newsletter, sending them information about our team, our project and trying to answer other teams questions from the previous newsletter</LI><LI>Toulouse – we sent them  4 of our BioBricks (BBa_K780003, BBa_K780002, BBa_K780001, BBa_K780000) </LI><LI>Groningen – we exchanged our official iGEM abstracts, translated their abstract into Polish and got our abstract translated into Dutch</LI><LI>Paris Saclay - we exchanged our official iGEM abstracts and we translated their into Polish and got our abstract translated into French</LI><LI>ETH Zurich – we filled in a survey about complexity in everyday life</LI><LI>Warwick - we filled in a survey about policy and practices</LI><LI>Valencia Biocampus - we filled in  a survey</LI></P><H2>Medal Criteria</H2><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Warsaw/Project"><H6>Up↑</H6></A><H3> Bronze </H3> We have registered iGEM Team Warsaw, had a blast working in the lab and plan to have even more fun with others during the Giant Jamboree!
