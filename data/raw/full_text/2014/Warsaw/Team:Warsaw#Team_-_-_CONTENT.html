My  scientific  interests entail  biological  chemistry  (mostly  chemistry  of  nucleic  acids  and  proteins),  bits  of neurochemistry, molecular biology of nucleic acids and synthetic biology (mostly fantasizing how  to  combine  fancy  natural  stuff  as  proteins,  RNAs,  etc.  into  systems  that  would  serve whatever purpose I have on  my  mind at the given time). Outside the lab, I do enjoy a good bike trip, some ballroom dancing or teaching people... whatever they want to learn and I can provide, so  it's usually English or chemistry. During this year's iGEM, I try to blow up the lab every other day (i.e. I'm a wetlab worker) but parallely, I help make sure that everything flows smoothly enough to prevent others from doing so (mostly by telling people  when to come to the lab and  when not &amp;  mundane stuff like this, really).</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><H4>Rafał Meysztowicz</H4> I'm studying Physics and Mathematics at College of Inter-Faculty Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences.

I am fascinated with mechanisms and machines - from watches and trains to elucidation of the mechanisms of action of drugs. I' ve discovered that IGEM reflects the way in which I see medicine – as ‘information science and art of healing’ and gives a unique opportunity to merge multiple interest in one clear idea. I want to act also in the area of mobile health, medical startups and healthcare markets design and contribute to gifted and STEM education.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE><TBODY><TR><TD><H4>Kamil Koziara</H4>I have MSc in Computer Science and I am studying Biotechnology at the University of
