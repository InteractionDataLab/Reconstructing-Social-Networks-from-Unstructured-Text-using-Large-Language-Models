BBa_K1459001 - PmrA
Protein name: PmrA Other names: basR, parA Gene name: basR Source organism for the data: Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. strain LT2 / SGSC1412 / ATCC 700720 UniProtKB signature: P36556 Gene sequence RefSeq accession number: NC_003197.1 Protein sequence RefSeq accession number: NP_463157.1 Length: 222 aa Molecular mass: 25,035 Da Cellular localization: cytoplasmic Biological function: transcription regulator
The PmrA protein is a cognate response regulator of the histidine kinase PmrB. Upon phosphorylation by PmrB, PmrA undergoes dimerization which dramatically increases its affinity for promoter DNA. This allows it to regulate expression of a number of genes, usually coding for LPS- modifying enzymes. In our project, we used the PmrA unchanged, for it to serve as an transcription inductor for our reporter - the GFP, expressed under the control of the PmrC promoter, i.e. the promoter of one of the genes involved in LPS modification. Notably, however, there is no PmrC gene under its promoter in our constructs, so that neither this LPS-modifyi ng enzyme, nor any other enzymes of this kind, are expressed.

BBa_K1459002 - C-term of PmrB from Salmonella enterica
PmrB is a transmembrane kinase. After binding iron (III) ion by binding peptide on extracellular loop, it's intracellular domain gains kinase activity and phosphorylates PmrA (BBa_K1459000). PmrB C-terminus is a part of two-component system. When fused with some binding tag, PmrB(N-term), PmrA and pmrC-reporter, it is a viable detecting system. If you wish to study PmrA-PmrB system more closely, we suggest reading following papers:

BBa_K1459003 - PmrA-PmrB(LBT) two-component system
PmrA-PmrB two-component system is native to Salmonella enterica and in its native state the system is responsible for chemotaxis. PmrB is a transmembrane protein with iron binding peptide on its extracellular loop. When PmrB binds iron (III) iron, the intracellular domain gains kinase activity and phosphorylates PmrA, which subsequently binds to pmrC promoter and induces expression of chemotaxis CheZ protein. In this part iron binding tag on the extracellular loop was exchanged with a lanthanide binding tag (LBT), to allow PmrA-PmrB two-component system to respond to lanthanide ions. If you wish to study PmrA-PmrB system more closely, we suggest reading following papers:

BBa_K1459004 - PmrA-PmrB(LBT) with terminator (BBa_B1006)
PmrA-PmrB two-component system is native to Salmonella enterica and in its native state it is responsible for chemotaxis. PmrB is a transmembrane protein with iron binding peptide on its extracellular loop. When PmrB binds iron (III) iron, its intracellular domain gains kinase activity and phosphorylates PmrA, which subsequently binds to pmrC promoter and induces expression of chemotaxis CheZ protein.

BBa_K1459005 - PmrA-PmrB(N-term)
This is N-terminal part of PmrA-PmrB two-component system native to Salmonella enterica. PmrA-PmrB two-component system is native to Salmonella enterica and in its native state it is responsible for chemotaxis. PmrB is a transmembrane protein with iron binding peptide on its extracellular loop. When PmrB binds iron (III) iron, it's intracellular domain gains kinase activity and phosphorylates PmrA, which subsequently binds to pmrC promoter and induces expression of chemotaxis CheZ protein. In this part iron binding tag on the extracellular loop was exchanged with a lanthanide binding tag (LBT), to allow PmrA-PmrB two-component system to respond to lanthanide ions. In this part, PmrB protein is truncated just before iron binding tag, which enables one to put any desired tag between two parts of PmrB, to construct a detecting system based on PmrA-PmrB system. If you wish to study PmrA-PmrB system more closely, we suggest reading following papers:

BBa_K1459006 - pmrC
This is pmrC promoter native to Salmonella enterica. PmrA-PmrB two-component system is native to Salmonella enterica and in its native state it is responsible for chemotaxis. PmrB is a transmembrane protein with iron binding peptide on its extracellular loop. When PmrB binds iron (III) iron, the intracellular domain gains kinase activity and phosphorylates PmrA, which subsequently binds to pmrC promoter and induces expression of chemotaxis CheZ protein. In this part iron binding tag on the extracellular loop was exchanged with a lanthanide binding tag (LBT), to allow PmrA-PmrB two-component system to respond to lanthanide ions.
This part is extraordinarily long for a promoter. It is designed this way because of the ca. 400 bp spacer at 5' end of the part - promoter is only 46 bp long, which would prove almost impossible to amplify through PCR or direct synthesis and ligation with pSB1C3. To counter this, we amplified pmrC with this spacer. This part contains also RBS from Salmonella enterica, just before the start of translation. If you wish to study PmrA-PmrB system more closely, we suggest reading following papers:

PmrB(LBT) is a engineered PmrB gene, where PmrB is a sensor histidine kinase present in the inner cell membrane of many species of bacteria, including E. coli and S. enterica. With a 30 amino acid periplasmic loop, it is capable of binding iron (III) and aluminium ions. The binding event induces a conformational change of the protein, which leads to ATP phosphate-derived autophosphorylation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, followed by transfer of the phosphate group onto the transcriptional regulator PmrA. As part of our project, the periplasmic iron/alumin ium-binding loop of the PmrB was substituted with a synthetic sequence - a lanthanide-binding ta g, intended to bind lanthanide ions, with terbium in particular. Such a binding event would then induce the aforementioned conformation change and phosphorylation of the PmrA, leading it to bind to the PmrC promoter, to allow for expression of the Green Fluorescent Protein - our reporter gene.

Results
In what we succeded
We did succed in constructing the lanthanide sensor in BioBrick standard and cloning its parts into pSB1C3 and sending seven of them to the Registry. As for 17.10.2014, we are trying to measure pmrC not activated by PmrA and also we are trying to measure GFP expression both in presence and in absence of lanthanide ions in the environment. We also measured the relative strenght of pmrC promoter in the absence of lanthanides.
What would we do (given more time)
Given more time, we would certainly try to test more lanthanide binding tags and to construct a system to effectively bind those ions, not only detect them. We would also try to quantify better our existing system.

We have pondered upon non-scientific questions we encountered during our work, e.g. how our topic, the lanthanides, intertwine with other topics of global importance and explained our rationale here .
Gold
We did our best to assist our international iGEM friends as best we could.
We did our best to go above and beyond thinking about science, its relations to our everyday life and how to tell everyone around about it , even in aspects you might not think of at once.
