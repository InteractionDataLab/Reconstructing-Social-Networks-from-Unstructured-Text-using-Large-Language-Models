Different Genotype provided us different choices when planning our experiment. Based on our project, following 4 species of E.coli was used in our project. All of these species are common and widely used in the field of molecular clone.

For more detaile, please read the ’’part’’ section of our wiki.</P><H5>Institutional Rules and Regulations</H5><P>The NUDT's Commission for Construction of Biological Sciences is responsible for bio-security in our institution. We have discussed the project with the teachers of this commission, and gotten their approval. Three extra teachers led by the deputy chief of DCB(the Department of Chemistry and Biology) were designated to provide us assistance if necessary and monitor us on our implementation on the lab bio-safety protocols at the same time.</P><H5>Training</H5><P>All team members were required to attend safety training focused on: </P><P><UL><LI>General biosafety principles.</LI><LI>The proper use of containment equipment (Biological safety (laminar flow) cabinets and delimited working space when required) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) (White coat and gloves).</LI><LI>Risk assessment of experiments involving: Recombinant DNA, ethidium bromide, other bio hazardous materials.</LI><LI>Proper Biological waste disposal.</LI></UL></P><H5>Lab security</H5><P><I>toxic chemical reagents EB</I></P><P>Ethidium Bromide (EB) is a very toxic agent. However, because it’s high efficiency and low cost, our lab still use this molecule as nucleic acid staining molecule. To prevent it from hurting us, our lab requires everyone in the electrophoresis Rome to wear a second pair of gloves. Also, Wasted gel were collected and properly disposed.</P><H3>Human Practices</H3><H5>Android Game</H5><P>This year we launched an Android game based on the classic game golden miner. The game was set on the expansion of the Ebola virus which aims to explain the basic principle and methods of the synthetic biology to the public. In each section, players are required to collect specific numbers of nucleotides to meet the need of synthetizing a new part (from a promoter to a CDS) and finally they combine them to be a device. This game was uploaded onto the Internet so everyone can download it and learn something about it. The download link is [<A href="http://pan.baidu.com/s/1i3xd9fj">http://pan.baidu.com/s/1i3xd9fj</A>]. It’s still a Chinese version so far. But the English version is coming.</P><H5>Bio lab security survey</H5><P>Recently we did the bio lab security survey in 12 universities and institutions (none of which were iGEM participants). Abundant statistic ensured the reliability of the conclusion followed.</P><P>
More than 200 people (248 to be exact) participate this research. According to the result, we have to confront a big problem that the security are not focused on as it should have been in China.</P><P>
As is shown by the result, on the field of implementation of lab-security policies, half of the respondents have never got a security training before they actually entered the lab, more than half of the respondents had no idea about the safety level of their own lab. On the field of personal experiment habit, more than 60percent of the respondents cannot tell the correct order to undress the protections, which implies the big safety problem.</P><P>
But we believe that with the development of the bio-technique and bio-awareness, people will pay more and more attention to the security aspect. As we can see, the bio security issues call for the global attention.</P><P><TABLE width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="1"><TBODY><TR><TD width="20%"><STRONG>Question number</STRONG></TD><TD width="65%"><STRONG>Question</STRONG></TD><TD width="15%"><STRONG>Options</STRONG></TD></TR><TR><TD>1</TD><TD>If you received before the formal into the laboratory  system of experimental training of the relevant safety regulations standard?</TD><TD>Y/N</TD></TR><TR><TD>2</TD><TD>Whether your school/test institution at the end of the training organization the corresponding assessment?</TD><TD>Y/N</TD></TR><TR><TD>3</TD><TD>As you know, have your school/research institutions related leaders or commission is responsible for the biological laboratory safety</TD><TD>Y, N or N/A</TD></TR><TR><TD>4</TD><TD>Whether your lab in the eye-catching place of the posted security policies, regulations and the implementation of safety manual support program?</TD><TD>Y, N or N/A</TD></TR><TR><TD>5</TD><TD>What do you think of your school/attaches great importance to the laboratory biosafety research institutions?</TD><TD>Importance, Value, General or Indifference</TD></TR><TR><TD>6</TD><TD>Do you know your laboratory biosafety level?</TD><TD>Y/N</TD></TR><TR><TD>7</TD><TD>Whether your lab of the PCR lab points have actual product preparation, sample preparation, amplification and product analysis area four partitions?</TD><TD>Y/N</TD></TR><TR><TD>8</TD><TD>What kind of switch used in your lab sink?</TD><TD>Manual type or Induction type</TD></TR><TR><TD>9</TD><TD>Did you know that lab fire-fighting equipment's location?</TD><TD>Y, N or No fire-fighting equipment</TD></TR><TR><TD>10</TD><TD>Whether your lab has equipped with eye and emergency shower equipment (a decontamination facilities)?</TD><TD>Y/N</TD></TR><TR><TD>11</TD><TD>Whether your lab prominently posted in the sign indicate the level of laboratory and forbid any irrelevant personnel to enter?</TD><TD>Y/N</TD></TR><TR><TD>12</TD><TD>When you are doing the experiment, cell phone rings, you will wearing gloves directly answering the phone?</TD><TD>Each, Often, Occasionally or Never</TD></TR><TR><TD>13</TD><TD>If the experiment table printed materials such as reagent contamination in the process of experiment, whether you will continue to use or into the wastepaper basket?</TD><TD>Each, Often, Occasionally or Never</TD></TR><TR><TD>14</TD><TD>Would you wait to pack waste liquid syringe needle, spear or disposable scalpels replacement after some resistance to plunge into the container full?</TD><TD>Each, Often, Occasionally or Never</TD></TR><TR><TD>15</TD><TD>Do you think of the correct measures of the following is the correct order of protective equipment?

And the science should not be made behind the doors. We attended the meet up held by Huazhong Agricultural University on 23rd and 24th August, 2014.</P><P>The Central China iGEMers’ Consortium(CCiC) invited Zhang Haoqian of PKU and Liu Yang of OUC, two accomplished former iGEM leaders to share their experiences with us and give their suggestions. Which exactly widen our thought. Jerry made a presentation to shared our projects at hand and team management either. This meet up was succeed and beneficial. And we believe that each team got something in return from the communication.</P><H5>Teach-ins</H5><P>On Oct. 15th,  2014. Jerry Qiu, the originator of the team NUDT-iGEM went to the Medical college of The Centralsouth university to make a promotion of his attractive and adorable experience with iGEM.</P><P>
The communication meeting began at 8:00 p.m. Nearly a half hundred undergraduates attended this meeting. Firstly, Jerry made an introduction of iGEM and its idea.  Then he shared our design and lab experience with them. Humorous words and graceful behaviors let Jerry get a band of new fans, who began to getting interested in iGEM!</P><P>
With thunderous applause Jerry ended the speech at about 9:30 p.m. This meeting expanded the influence of the iGEM and help some people renew the conception of synthetic biology.</P><DIV align="right"><A href="https://2014.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:NUDT_CHINA/Safety&amp;action=edit"> Click here to edit this page!</A><A href="https://2014.igem.org/Special:Upload">Click here to upload! </A></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
