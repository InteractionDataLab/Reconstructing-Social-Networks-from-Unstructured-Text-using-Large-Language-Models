Team:NUDT CHINA/Team
From 2014.igem.org
About our team ( Official Team Profile )
Our team originally set in March 2013, and this year would be our first time to take participate in iGEM. Six students who are from four distinguished majors and five experienced instructors composed a compact team, and we are dedicating engineering bacteria to solve a typical graph theory mathematical problem so-called SPP-for-short. We obtained lots of happiness and inspirations from iGEM and we are really appreciate this chance to communicate with other universities and to get a deeper understanding about synthetic biology.

Self-introduction
Li Miyang: Hi, I am Li Miyang, the team leader of NUDT_china. This year is the first time for our team to participate in iGEM. As abecedarians, we encountered many difficulties, both technically and institutionally. However, with the great enthusiasm and endeavor of our group members as well as our instructors, we made progress one step at a time. And as the leader, I dedicated to organization and progression of the whole project. In every aspect, including project approval request, program refining, experimental operation and process management, together with other members, I tried my best to do a good job.
Qiu Xinyuan: Hello there, I'm Xinyuan Qiu, the originator of the team NUDT_CHINA. In our project I cover most part of the wet lab as well as the poster designing and the presentation. I also participated in the project designing  and  some other PR issues. As a bio-geek, I abhor boring life and chase after new and exciting things. That's why I'm here for the iGEM and that's also why my team can be formed and fight its way to this far in face of lots of predictable and unpredictable obstacles in NUDT. It's my great honor to have all my team members with me in iGEM 2014, and I believe that we can get what we want from It.
Zhu Qianhui: I’m Rose Zhu, a girl from Jiujiang city which is a lovely city near Poyang Lake. I have never been away from water. I enjoy dance and imagine I were a stream wiggling by the forests. Water is the best description of my personalities. I’m of a gentle and flexible nature. I can feel that under the water surface, there is secret of life calling for my exploration. Being a member of NUDT-China for IGEM, I’m excited by sharing curiosity, knowledge and ideas about biology.
Xie Nianhao: I am Nianhao Xie who have great curiosity to the unknown fields especially the secrets of life. Living in a small village made it possible for me to observe and think about the nature. I am good at painting and mathematics which enhance imaginal thinking and logic thinking. Although I am just an amateur of biology, I am inspired by grasping new knowledge and applying what I know (as an engineering student) to synthetic biology, such as modelling. I enjoy the process of brainstorming and arguing with my partners. (We are full of enthusiasm!)
Zhang Chuyuan: I’m Aloice Zhang who come from a hilly city located in the southwest of China. Living in the misty mountains, animals and plants become my friends who told imagical stories of life and shared the whole childhood with me. There is a living forest in my heart, I like reading and writing at the shadow of leaves and regard it as the discovery and expression of the inner forest. I’m interested in various culture all over the world, too. I’m eager to know more people and improve with them together.
Han Jize: My name is Jize Han，I come from Qinhuangdao Hebei China. I study in National University of Defense Technology, major in Applied Physics. .After about two years’ hard work, I have learned most of the courses of my specialty and have a good command of English. This year, I participated in China Undergraduate Physicists’ Tournament, and ranked 4 of 39 best-known universities in China. Since I was a child, I am very interested in biological, and I am looking forward to studying Biophysics in future. I'm good at logical thinking, proficient in programming, theoretical analysis and physical experiments. In this project, I am responsible for the production of human practice, by writing a Java App Android-based platform game, to promote the concept of synthetic biology.
