Heads
Name:
Maximilian Ehrhardt, B.Sc
Studies:
In progress: Master of Science in Human-and Molecular Biology (Saarland University)
Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology with focus on human and molecular biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
I was always fascinated by the power, especially the power of manipulation. In synthetic biology you  only have to manipulate one enzyme, one molecule or one base pair; you   must turn one little wheel to change the whole consensus, the whole mind, the whole  structure of the organism and finally the whole universe. In our  project I will  demonstrate the power of manipulation by the expression of a hyaluronic acid  synthase (HAS)  which only has two small amino acid exchanges in comparison to all  other HASes but therefore produces  high molecular weight hyaluronic acid.  Furthermore I hope that I can improve my skills of bending an organism according to  my sake, but personally I do not think that Bacillus megaterium has anything to oppose  me . The last part of my motivation to participate in iGEM is that I wish to get in  contact with other creatures of this surprisingly manifold universe and to have a lot of fun.
Name:
Philip Hartz, B.Sc

Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology with Focus on human and molecular biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
As Commander I´m faced with the honourable and difficult task to lead or alliance in the fight  against cancer. Due to my military and scientific training, I´m used to combine both strategic             and problem oriented ways of thinking and thus especially predestined to find a way even in  hopeless situations or if there is a trap! During the runtime of this mission I want to put my  leadership skills to the test,improve where possible and help our team by my unique abilities  to gain a glorious victory over the deadly threat. Raise the shields and prepare for lightspeed!
Name:
Aline Loehfelm, B.Sc
Studies:
In progress: Master of Science in Human-and Molecular Biology (Saarland University)
Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology with focus on human and molecular biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
My primary function is to understand scientific mechanisms. But I have greater ambitions than those for  which I was programmed: I would very much like to gain knowledge in project-management and  -financing, to  enlarge my field of study and acquire a larger variety of experimental procedures. I would  also like to  update my current social-relationship-program by making new contacts around the galaxy,  working in all sorts of teams and perhaps even linking Science and Society.

Name:
Nicolas Ecker, B.Sc
Studies:
In progress: Master of Science in Biophysics
(Saarland University)
Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biophysics
(Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
Having spent my academical childhood in the deserted plains of theoretical physics, my dream has  always been being able to connect to the outside world of other sciences. I hope to use the  guidance given by our leaders to improve my skills and find the force needed to successfully master the interdisciplinary tasks given by the harsh environment that is Biophysics. In the end I might be able to utilize the knowledge I gained in the fields of planning and arranging work  together with a larger group to take on bigger problems that I'm going to encounter in the future.
Name:
Marc Finkler, B.Sc
Studies:
In progress: Master of Science in Biophysics (Saarland University)
Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biophysics (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
One of my biggest motivations is the possibility to be a part of such a big project, where  I can improve teamwork and skills in laboratory work. I was always interested in biological  processes and methods. So it’s my aim to gain experience in the biology and to use this  knowledge for later projects in science. Another motivation is to work together with students  of other university courses and to share experiences and knowledge. At least there is one  more motivation to take part in the iGEM-Project. The international level shows that there is a big demand in such projects and so I’m very proud of taking part in it.

Origin:
Motivation:
Greetings! Being a humanoid protocol droid I'm eager to carry out any protocol I'm provided  with in a wet lab environment always trying to enhance my current program . And  our project for the iGEM competition offers a remarkably way to do so. The idea of  constructing biological systems with novel features that provide the potential to  benefit my fellow humanoids and the analogy to electronic circuits, which, as a droid, I'm based on as well, is quite appealing. Furthermore I'm looking forward to meeting  like-minded life forms from galaxies far, far away...
Name:
Denise Pirritano
Studies:
In progress: Bachelor of Science in Biology with focus on human and molecular  biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
I was always interested in biological processes, mechanism of life and therewith associated medical research. Therefore it is a great opportunity to be a part of such a big project. On the one hand I gain experience in the laboratory and so at teamwork. On the other to develop a project from beginning till the end, like in working life later. Furthermore on our project I am fascinated by the fact that we only have to exchange two small amino acid by the hyaluronic acid synthase (HAS) to  create a new biological machine, which produce a new hyaluronic acid. My biggest motivation is that we can with this new machine in further future help people.
Name:
Andreas Riske, B.Sc
Studies:
In progress: Master of Science in Human- and Molecular Biology (Saarland University)
Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology with focus on human and molecular biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
Based on my field of interest, research in molecular biology for medical applications, I was really  excited to take part at the international iGEM project and joining an intergalactic mission ranging from  recruiting sponsors to the complete synthesis and characterization of a very special biomolecule.  Broaden my horizon by meeting students of my field from all over the galaxy is one of my personal  interests which I have already came in contact with in my semester abroad on the far north situated   planet of Sweden. Furthermore the thought of competing motivates my great team consisting of  students from different semesters and me to reach our ambitioned goal and to finally unleash the  force of the naked mole rat.
Name:
Fabian Riske, B.Sc
Studies:
In progress: Master of Science in Human-and Molecular Biology (Saarland University)
Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology with focus on human and molecular biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
I am looking forward to the iGEM project as it gives me the opportunity to develop new skills  in different fields of molecular biology. Especially the idea of working in a team to develop a  project from the beginning on fascinates me. By acquiring sponsors, organizing travel and  explaining scientific results to a broad spectrum of galactic inhabitants I hope to improve my communication skills. New experimental procedures on new planets will for sure  enhance my  qualifications. More than one year ago I successfully returned from my first  mission abroad  which guided me into the beautiful but also rough landscape of northern  Sweden. Eventually  I am glad to be a part of our iGEM team and to have the chance to meet new inhabitants from the whole universe.
Name:
Aurélien Strehl, B.Sc
Studies:
In progress: Master of Science in Neurosciences (University of Strasbourg and Saarland University; bilingual study path)
Completed:Bachelor of Science in Biology
(University of Strasbourg and Saarland University; bilingual study path)
Origin:
Motivation:
For quite some time now, I have been interested in the mechanisms of life and the Living Force. By participating in this project, I hope to acquire some further knowledge of the great many  molecules involved in the aging-process. It is quite fascinating to observe that so many  mechanisms are similar in completely different life-forms, such as the naked mole-rat and the  human-being. Even more so, because we can use knowledge of the molecular-processes of one species  to understand those of another species. Those studying the Force are confident that this  homology is correlated to the fact that the midi-chlorians are found in all living things. Furthermore, I am very keen on the prospect of meeting young scientists from other horizons, be it  other fields of study or other parts of the galaxy…

In progress: PhD student as well as research and teaching assistant (department of Neurobiology/ Zoology/ Physiology, Saarland University)
Completed:Diploma in Biology with focus on human and molecular biology (Saarland University)
Origin:
Motivation:
Right from the beginning I was very fond of this project, because it combines a great number of my  personal interests. I have always been interested in art and the way in which colours can  influence our feelings and convey certain messages. I am also fascinated by biology and the beauty  of nature. By participating in this project, I hope to combine art and biology, but also to perfect  my skills in the art of explaining scientific facts to a not necessary scientific audience. Furthermore I am very glad to work in a team of people from different scientific and cultural  backgrounds and to have the opportunity to meet people from around the galaxy.
