Under biological conditions, protein degradation is a very slow process which can take anywhere from several hours to days to months! Some of these proteins are causing disease while accumulating. To combat this issue, our system is similar to that of a light switch, where a response is seen immediately after a trigger is toggled.
                             This year we attempted to select a specifically-labeled protein for immediate degradation via the bioorthoginal auxin-inducible-degron (AID) System (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/e/e5/Auxin-Based_Degron_System_Nevada_2014_igem.pdf">Nishimura et al.2009</A>). This Auxin system has been published and used by previous iGEM teams, but has never been combined with its parallel system, jasmonic acid, in non-plant cells. However, before we could start our journey we needed to understand some very unique characteristics about Protein Degradation. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV id="WorksTabs"><UL><LI><A href="#install" title="Understanding the Perfect Model">Understanding the Perfect Model</A></LI><LI><A href="#login" title="Typical Protein Degradation Rates">Typical Protein Degradation Rates</A></LI><LI><A href="#share" title="How Protein Degradation Works">How Protein Degradation Works</A></LI><LI><A href="#friend" title="The BAITSwitch">The BAITSwitch</A></LI></UL><DIV id="install"><DIV class="col-md-6 no-pad-left"><DIV class="section-short-title"><H1>How a Lightbulb Works</H1></DIV><DIV class="section-short-desc"><P>An easy way to explain our system is to imagine a light switch: a source of instantaneous change.

Together these three enzymes create a &quot;three-step enzymatic cascade, resulting in the covalent transfer of ubiquitin to target proteins&quot; (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/f/f5/Plant_Physiol.-2012-Kelley-47-55-nevada-igem-2014.pdf">D. Kelly</A>). </P><P>In the UPS, each enzyme serves a specific function to target the substrate protein for destruction by the 26S proteasome or alters their biochemical properties and subcellular organization in plants. Here, E1 serves as the ubiquitin activating enzyme while containing two isoforms. E2 serves as the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and is believed to have at least 40 different derivatives. Then, E3 serving as the ubiquitin ligase which is predicted to encode for more than a thousand potential E3 ligases.

These two systems are analogous in component functions, and they both result in rapid and specific protein degradation. Current methods of post-translational degradation, such as RNAi, are nonspecific and can have adverse effects from off-target effects. However, previous research shows that the components of the bait-switch can be transferred from plants to yeast and other vertebrate cells. Although mammalian cells do not contain the receptors to recognize these plant hormones, they contain the same SCF degradation pathway, and this can be exploited to achieve targeted, rapid protein degradation. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="closer-section"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="section-title" data-uk-scrollspy="{cls:'uk-animation-slide-top', delay:500, repeat: true}"><H1>Breakdown of the Auxin-Inducible-Degron (AID) system</H1></DIV><DIV class="section-desc" data-uk-scrollspy="{cls:'uk-animation-fade', delay:700, repeat: true}"><P>Shown below is a breakdown of the BAITSwitch and how it is used to degrade proteins of interest.The individual components are shown below.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></SECTION><SECTION id="team-section"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV class="section-title" data-uk-scrollspy="{cls:'uk-animation-slide-top', delay:500, repeat: true}"><H1>Our Team</H1></DIV><DIV class="section-desc" data-uk-scrollspy="{cls:'uk-animation-fade', delay:700, repeat: true}"><P>Only through the joint efforts of all of these students and our wonderful advisor, Team Nevada was able to achieve all of their summer and semester goals.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col-md-12"><DIV id="TeamTabs"><DIV id="member1"><DIV class="col-md-6 no-pad-right"><DIV class="section-short-title"><H1>Khurram Fahim</H1></DIV><DIV class="section-short-desc"><P>A Dual Major in Biochemistry and Neuroscience</P></DIV><DIV class="member-desc"><P>Khurram Fahim is a senior biochemistry and neuroscience major at the University of Nevada, Reno.
