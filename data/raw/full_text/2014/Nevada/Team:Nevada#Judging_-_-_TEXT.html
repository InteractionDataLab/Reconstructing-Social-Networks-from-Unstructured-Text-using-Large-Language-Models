Judging
The Nevada iGEM team has submitted four new parts to the registry and will have shown that three of the parts work as expected. We have also used two parts previously submitted by the Evry 2013 team and shown that they function in yeast as a part of our BAIT switch project.
New Parts Submitted to the Registry and shown to work as expected:
Jaz1
Jaz6
COI1
http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1347003  Existing BioBrick Part or Devices that have been further characterized
TIR1
GFP-AID
Attributes
The BAIT Switch project was conceived and designed by the entire Nevada iGEM team with the help of our advisors, Ian Wallace and Veronica Zepeda. We all worked throughout the summer with both individual tasks and group projects. We attended weekly meetings on Mondays to inform everyone where we were individually and what the next steps would be as a team.
Khurram Fahim and Janice Bautista focused on the TIR1 system. They modified and engineered new plasmids for integration into yeast. These included plasmids containing the IAA17 degron and GFP reporter. Some methods they performed are tagging of TIR1 with a Myc tag; primer design to create the insert of pTEF-GFP-IAA17; and later, work with JAZ6 in the COI1 system.
Matthew Hawn and Zoe Meraz focused on the COI1 system. This included modification and engineering of appropriate plasmids to be joined to those of Khurram and Janice for the goal of a bioorthogonal system using auxin and coronatine in yeast. Matt also created many of the infographics and web design, as well as performed yeast growth assays.
Zoe focused on the synthesis of the construct of pTEF-GFP-JAZ1 and moving it from E coli into yeast. She also completed all safety form requirements.
Tori Speicher was responsible for all things parts registry related! She also performed many lab procedures such as gel electrophoresis, PCR, miniprep, etc.
Josh Beard also worked with the COI1 system. He helped in the tagging of COI1 with HA and worked with the JAZ degron for introduction into E. coli and movement into yeast cells.
We received parts and plasmids from the UCSF_UCB iGEM Team
and the Liebman lab - University of Nevada, Reno
