Regulatory Agencies and Black Market Phage
The man and woman sat in two chairs in front of the doctor. They were holding each other’s   hands tightly. “I really think we should try phage,” the husband stated. “It may be her only   hope.”
The doctor replied, “I would love to try... none of the antibiotics are working, but phage   isn’t regulated. No companies can sell it for human use. Even the Eliava Institute is no longer   allowed to sell phages to people in the United States. Though besides phage, I’m not sure what   more I can do to try and stop her infection from spreading.”
“My daughter will die if we don’t use phage,” the husband continued.
No one spoke and a silence filled the room. The doctor realized that the man was right:   bacteriophages, viruses that infect and can kill bacteria, probably were the young girl’s only   hope. Her infection was antibiotic resistant and no other medicines were helping. Over the past   few years, word about phage had slowly spread. Now, as an increasing number of people desired   to use phages beyond agricultural applications, regulatory agencies delayed the possibility given   their uncertainty of how they should control phage, especially genetically engineered phage.  It had been just one year since the doctor had learned about phage and their great uses in   fighting bacterial infections. He had read about bacteriophages and thought them a miraculous   tool for when normal antibiotics did not work, which had been occurring more frequently these   past ten years. The doctor knew the implications in using phage: that they were not allowed and   their use would go against the rules of the hospital. However, the doctor also wanted to help the   patient. He had become a doctor because he wanted to save people.
“Doctor, what if I can find phage,” the wife inquired. “There are ways and there are   places.”
Both the doctor and the woman’s husband looked at her surprised. Even the husband had   not realized that his wife had found a phage supplier. The husband and the doctor had heard the   rumors of black market phage, a way to get unregulated phages. These treatments were risky,   though, since there was no governance or supervision. No one was quite sure what was in each   phage cocktail, but some people, especially those who had nothing left to lose, were willing to   take the risk.
The doctor spoke first. “I can’t be a part of this. I wish I could help, but the governmental   agencies do not allow phage. If anyone found out about this, my license would be revoked. Are   you sure you two want to do this?”
The wife nodded first, and then the husband. “We are sure.”
The doctor continued, “You must take your daughter from the hospital then, if you wish   to use phage. We cannot be responsible for what may happen and we cannot let you endanger   other patients if something goes awry with the phage, especially since there is no regulation on   the phage cocktail contents. I am very sorry.”
The husband spoke up, perplexed by the dilemma. “This could cause more problems! She   will no longer have medical help. What if something goes wrong or she gets worse?”
“Phage is not approved by the regulatory agencies,” the doctor explained. “We are not   allowed to have phage treatments here. I want to be able to help your daughter, I truly do, but I   cannot do it while risking the lives of other patients. That is why I’m suggesting you remove her   from the hospital and follow whatever path you believe will benefit your daughter the most.”
“She may die,” the wife whispered.
The doctor answered, “That is a risk the regulatory agencies have created.”
The girl survived. The phages saved her. Those around her, however, found her   astounding recovery surprising and quite nearly impossible. Teachers, relatives, and community   members began to talk about what could have helped the girl. They wanted to know the cure.  “How had she suddenly recovered when the antibiotics did nothing?” they questioned.  One of the girl’s neighbors was a doctor. He had recently become aware of phages and   brought them up first. “Bacteriophages could have done this. They are illegal, but I can think of   no other explanation,” he told his coworkers around him after he described the girl’s story. “I am   surprised her doctor or even her parents would choose phage. It is untested and no one knows   what it could do if released accidentally or used incorrectly. And where could they even get the   phage?”
Spiraling outwards from the small group, the news of the girl and her phage treatment   spread. A minor city newspaper picked up the story. No names were used but the concept of   phage was explored in the article. Phage was depicted as a topic of interest, an important   mechanism for combating antibiotic resistance that should be examined more.
Within a year, the little girl was the new poster child for phage: a modern-day miracle   used by scientists and doctors who supported phage therapeutics. Her story was used to try to   pressure the regulatory agencies, to bring them closer to investigating phage and its possible   uses. She became embroiled in the fight for and against phage, as some opponents argued the   risk her parents took was too great.
Over time, the anonymity of the case became impossible. The doctor, who had let the   girl’s parents use phage to save their daughter’s life, felt harassed by those around him even   though he had not been the one to first propose phage treatment or to give phage to the girl. He   soon left the hospital amid criticism. All he had wanted to do was help his patient.
