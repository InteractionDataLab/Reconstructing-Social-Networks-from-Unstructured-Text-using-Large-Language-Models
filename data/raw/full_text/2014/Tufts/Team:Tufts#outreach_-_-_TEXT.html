Lecture Series: A Primer in Biological Research at Tufts
Fall 2014
Biology and the life sciences have experienced extensive innovations over the last half        century. Researchers at Tufts have been consistent contributors to these major advancements        making their work pertinent teaching material for students interested in pursuing research        opportunities. In this course, undergraduates will not only be able to explore the landscape of        biological research performed at Tufts, but engage in discussions with the faculty behind it.        Over the course of the semester, the students will become acquainted with various research        publications by creating presentations, drafting proposals, and discussing the research with        faculty and peers. The course will culminate in group proposals in which the students develop       a potential research endeavor based on the principles examined throughout the course.        Students will have the opportunity to have these proposals funded with the help of the Tufts        Synthetic Biology team.       The goal of the Tufts Synthetic Biology team has been to establish an undergraduate team of        researchers who will work closely with select faculty to take part in an annual competition,        learn about research on campus, discuss bioethics, and learn how to write a research proposal.       We believe the best way to intellectually prime and train undergraduates who want to take        part in this highly independent research project is through a class which exposes them not       only to the technical aspects of the molecular biology techniques involved but also to the       administrative necessities of running an independent lab. Students taking this course will be        prepared to pursue undergraduate research in a professor’s lab or as a member of the Tufts       Synthetic Biology team.

Intellectual Goals
To impart familiarity and a thorough understanding of the components involved in the research,        design, development, and experimentation associated with the life sciences, for real        world experience and application. Students, particularly underclassman, taking the course will        gain insight into the landscape of research at Tufts so that they may become involved more        rapidly.
Specific Topics:
- Overview research in Life Sciences at Tufts
- Fundamental molecular biology techniques
- Current methods for genomic modification
- Ethical considerations of research
- Human practices

Student Involvement
Before guest lectures, the class will receive papers written by the visiting lecturer. A one-       page summary and reflection of the publication is to be completed for the following class        during which discussion of the article will occur. All students must also be prepared for the        question and answer session which will follow the guest lecture.
For a set amount of time each class, students will divide into their groups to discuss the        semester project and pose questions to the instructors. Project checkpoints will also be        required for the 4th, 7th, and 9th weeks of the course to ensure all students are progressing at a        sufficient pace.
Final Project Description
All semester projects include the following:
- 3 project checkpoints
- At minimum, a single page summary of the student’s role within and understanding of        the project.
- A presentation to the class
Project Options:
- (Group) Synthetic Biology Proposals (7-10 pages)
- (Individual) Extended Proposals from Publications Review (3-5 Pages)
A final paper detailing a project proposal for a future synthetic biology project that could        be pursued by the iGEM team.
