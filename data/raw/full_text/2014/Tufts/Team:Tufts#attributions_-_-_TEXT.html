NEGEM 2014
We would like to thank Traci Haddock and the BU iGEM Team for organizing the three NEGEM conferences and providing an environment for collaboration and feedback. We would also like to offer special thanks to Traci Haddock, Brian Teague, and Natalie Farny for their insightful feedback on our project and presentation.
Cell Lines
The Endy Lab at Stanford University kindly provided E. coli strains harboring plasmids used in the construction and deployment of the merRNA.
The Kolter Lab at Harvard Medical School kindly provided ZK1056 E. coli which were used to assess biofilm formation.
The Fuhrman Lab at Tufts University kindly provided JM109 cells used for general cloning purposes and biofilm assessment.
Technical Insight
Dr. Nikhil Nair served as advisor for Tufts iGEM and provided assistance in scientific and administrative matters.
Dr. Monica Ortiz met with the team and offered invaluable logistical advice relating to the construction of a phagemid and the potential hurdles associated with delivery to cells in a biofilm.
Dr. Joshua Kritzer provided his expert opinion on design considerations relating to merRNA construction and promoter selection.
Dr. Andrew Camilli reviewed an early proposal involving c-di-GMP signalling in bacteria and offered various suggestions.
Dr. David Walt was an early advisor to the team and reviewed the proposals.
Dr. Donald McGowan, Director of Tufts Corporate and Foundation Relations, helped the team with outreach.
Lab Space
We would like to thank the Tufts Department of Biology for allowing Tufts iGEM to use its lab space and communal equipment. We would especially like to thank Michael Grossi for his assistance in this respect.
Future of Bacteriophage Conference
Thanks to Dr. Robin Pierce, Dr. Andrew Camilli, Mark Mimee, Anna Kuchment, Sebastien Lemire, Robert Citorik, Dr. Michael Koeris, Dr. Nikhil Nair, and Tufts University President Anthony Monaco.  Also special thanks to Christopher Ghadban for his hard work putting the conference together.  Thanks to Anna’s Taqueria, Flatbread Company, Laudi’s Breakfast House, and Tufts Catering for providing way too much food.  Thanks to the Institute for Global Leadership for providing recording equipment.
