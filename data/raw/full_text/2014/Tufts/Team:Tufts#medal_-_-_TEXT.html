This Project achieved a Gold Medal!
iGEM Medals for Health and Medicine Teams
Bronze
The following 6 goals have been achieved
1. Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Giant Jamboree.
2. Successfully complete and submit the iGEM 2014 Judging form.
3. Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
4. Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
5. The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. Please see the iGEM 2011 Imperial College Acknowledgements page for an example.
Attributions
6. Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. Please see the Registry help page on adding new parts. A new application and/or outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part's/ Device's function) of a previously existing BioBrick part also counts. Please see the Registry help page on how to document your contributions. To fulfill this criteria, you will also need to submit the part with its original part name to the Registry, following the submission guidelines.
Part Number(s): BBa_K1427000, BBa_K1427001
Silver
In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, the following 4 goals have been achieved:
1. Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
BBa_K1427000, BBa_K1427001
2. Document the characterization of this part in the Main Page section of that Part's/Device's Registry entry.
3. Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
Part Number(s): BBa_K1427000, BBa_K1427001
4. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.
The Future of Phage and Synthetic Biology
Gold
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, any one of the three possible requirements required for the gold medal was achieved
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team's scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. To help the judges, we have indicated the area we feel Tufts iGEM should be evaluated on for the special prize

Short description of team's accomplishments
Tufts iGEM received the SYNENERGENE grant to examine the intersection of syn.bio, phage, policy/ethics, regulation & industry. In addition to the required application & techno-moral scenarios, we hosted a national conference which brought together experts from the above fields to discuss & present on phage application, ethics, & potential as well as associated precautions, regulations, & integration to the medical field. Working with these experts, we will continue to expand the conversation.
