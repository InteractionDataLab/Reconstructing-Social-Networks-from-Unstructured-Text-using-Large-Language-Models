This October, Tufts Synthetic Biology hosted a conference, The Future of Phage and Synthetic Biology, which brought together experts from academia, industry, and regulation to discuss and present on emerging research concerning the applications of phage - specifically bacteriophage therapy.
The conference incorporated two main events. The first was a discussion between experts, held  under Chatham House rules, to discuss and advance a pre-written framework for bacteriophage  applications and associated safety and regulatory considerations. This was followed by a public  forum to present and discuss the results and implications with a more general audience before  shifting to guided and informal discussion.
