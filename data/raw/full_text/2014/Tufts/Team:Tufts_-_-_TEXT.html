Tufts iGEM seeks to expand undergraduate science education and allow students to take part in all aspects of the research process, from drafting proposals, to securing funding, and finally carrying out the research in lab. These projects expose students not only to the technical aspects of synthetic biology but also to the social, legal, and ethical implications generated by their work. The team is composed of passionate individuals from all fields of study, who are driven to investigate and address pertinent issues in medicine, health, technology, research, and bioethics. In addition to carrying out undergraduate, self-directed research, the Tufts iGEM team teaches and mentors underclassmen, develops relationships with professors, and generally works to promote the involvement of undergraduates in biological research.
