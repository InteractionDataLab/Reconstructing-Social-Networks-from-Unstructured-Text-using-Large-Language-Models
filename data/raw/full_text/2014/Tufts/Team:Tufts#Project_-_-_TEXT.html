Robust biofilm formation using a cyclic-di-GMP aptamer and investigating ethics and applications of engineered bactiophage
A long, noncoding massively expressed regulatory RNA (merRNA) discovered in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is present in high levels during its dormant phase. The merRNA is believed to sequester  cyclic-di-GMP, much like a sponge. Since cyclic-di-GMP is a second messenger for various cellular  functions, including motility and biofilm formation, the Tufts iGEM team introduced this merRNA  sequence into E. coli. Constitutive expression of this merRNA transcript was shown to increase biofilm  formation. This property can be useful in microbe-based approaches to environmental remediation.  Earlier designs for phage delivery of the merRNA to disrupt biofilms inspired an investigation into the  policy surrounding engineered bacteriophage. Tufts iGEM will be convening a panel of experts from  various disciplines to put forth recommendations for the responsible use of phage in therapeutic and  industrial applications. A proposal will be drafted for a silk bandage containing a phage cocktail which  can prevent and treat infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Ribosponge Project Description:
We have devised a method to introduce a DNA sequence which encodes an RNA aptamer (i.e. - an  oligonucleotide sequence which binds to a specific molecule) into a non-pathogenic E. coli strain. We  have dubbed this RNA aptamer a “ribosponge” due to its unique mode of action. The ribosponge binds  cyclic di-GMP, a secondary intracellular messenger which signals bacteria to enter a persistent or biofilm  state. The signal is universal among many species such as E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and M. tuberculosis.  Blocking the signal of c-di-GMP by binding it with an aptamer could prevent the persistent state in these  and other pathogens. In order to ferry the sequence encoding the aptamer from our non-pathogenic E.  coli into other bacteria of the same species, we plan on using an M13 phage which does not kill the  bacteria. The project has also inspired our collaboration with the Rathneau Institute and SYNENERGENE as we  look at the feasability of developing ribosponge into a product, and examine the regulatory, legal, and  ethical challenges of packing it into a bacteriophage.
