Kevin Pineault:
I was attracted to iGEM's innovative approach of inspiring undergraduate students to lead and conduct exciting research in the growing field of synthetic biology. As a student and team member, I joined out of interest to learn about laboratory procedure to create BioBricks, to work towards a humanitarian goal alongside our research efforts, and to develop an awesome research project to combat the decreasing numbers of oysters in our local Chesapeake Bay. My role in the team has been outside the lab, developing/leading meetings and helping every student member work towards there highest potential. I have to give most of the credit the other members on the team for their '''great''' work this summer in the lab and outside the lab visiting oyster farms. I like to slackline when it is nice outside, and I am not afraid to dance in public.
