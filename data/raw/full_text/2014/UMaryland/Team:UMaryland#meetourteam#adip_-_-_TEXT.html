Adip Bhargav:
 
I am a junior majoring in Neurobiology and Physiology and minoring in French at the University of Maryland, College Park. At UMD, I am involved in many activities such as student government and teaching as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant in Organic Chemistry. I plan on going to medical school after my undergraduate studies. I joined iGEM in order to experience all the different aspects of research. From fundraising to applying lab work to human practices, I've gained many invaluable skills through iGEM. When I'm not working on iGEM things, I love to meet new people and play tennis in my free time!.
