Overview
The UMaryland iGem team opted for a project that hits close to home; with the Chesapeake Bay in our backyard, we have the potential to make a direct impact on the community. As Maryland’s most important natural landmark, the Chesapeake Bay is an integral part of our state’s identity. The bay is home to a diverse ecosystem, and is an economic boon to the area, supporting both the seafood industry and local tourism. Since the health of the bay is important, we looked into current problems in need of attention. In particular, the predicament of the Chesapeake’s oysters piqued our interest. As oyster populations declined over the years, the absence of this filtration system left a host of problems, including decreased water clarity and rising chemical pollutant levels. If the oyster populations can be maintained, it will improve the overall health of the Chesapeake. One way to combat oyster fatalities is to develop a way to monitor Dermo infestations.
 
 
Applications in the lab
It is believed that P. marinus enters oyster hemocytes utilizing a galectin on the cell’s surface, CvGal1, that allows binds preferentially to P. marinus. Our aim is to exploit CvGal1’s ability to bind to P. marinus in order to design a biosensor for the parasite. By expressing the galectin on the surface of E. coli and triggering a signal transduction cascade within the bacterial cell, the E. coli could produce Green Fluorescent Protein. Thus, P. marinus binding to CvGal1 would trigger the expression of GFP within E. coli,  creating a visual marker for the parasite. The majority of this project will be accomplished through genetic cloning and bacterial transformation. Although laboratory methods for Dermo detection using Polymerase Chain Reaction  exist, they are currently not capable of detecting the disease in real time. In the time needed to conduct a laboratory test, Dermo could have easily spread to new locations. This biosensor would help to accurately pinpoint Dermo infestation levels in real time. If we can pinpoint the location of Dermo, as elucidated in this research proposal, then we can ultimately develop a biosensor that can react to Dermo with targeted destruction.
Brief overview of servicing the community
We having been traveling around Maryland conducting various community outreach efforts by visiting local schools and oyster farms. During each visit, members present our project and spread awareness on the current state of the Chesapeake Bay, as well as ways individuals can help service the Bay. Some presentations are made on synthetic biology to increase student participation and interest in the sciences. We also have a committee dedicated to creating an educational computer game that teaches others about the issues that the Chesapeake Bay currently faces. It is our team’s hope that our research results to be presented at the iGEM jamboree will have a profound and positive impact on the health of the Chesapeake Bay and oyster populations worldwide
