Camila is a junior Bioengineering major at UMD, and iGEM has been an incredible first experience working in a wet lab. She has really enjoyed being part of the team and taking part in this student-run research project. In addition to iGEM, Camila loves playing soccer, acting in theatre productions, and fencing sabre for the UMD club team.
