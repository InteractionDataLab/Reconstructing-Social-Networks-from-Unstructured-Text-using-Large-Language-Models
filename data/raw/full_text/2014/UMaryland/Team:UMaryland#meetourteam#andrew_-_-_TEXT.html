Andrew Zhao:
 
Andrew Zhao is currently a sophomore in bioengineering, with plans to continue studies in the field after his undergraduate years. Andrew joined iGEM as his first practical research experience in the lab and hopes to contribute as much as he learns.The fact that the students are given so much autonomy over the project is also really appealing. One of my hobbies is yo-yoing and I know (only) a handful of tricks - they're simple but they look cool!
