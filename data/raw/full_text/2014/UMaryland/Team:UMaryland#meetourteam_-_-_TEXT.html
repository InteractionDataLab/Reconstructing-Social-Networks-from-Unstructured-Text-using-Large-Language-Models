About Umaryland
UMaryland 2014 is the inaugural iGEM team of the University of Maryland, College Park. We are a combined effort of several departments and numerous faculty mentors. Although it is only our first year, we believe our hard work and dedication has paid off. We can't wait for this year's competition! GO TERPS!
