Janine Taira:
I'm planning on going to dental school after my undergraduate degree. I'm participating iGem because I want to have an hands-on experience in the lab, and modifying bacteria for competition seemed like an interesting and unique way to get that experience. It's super cool that in less than a year, we'll have some kind of a product to show for all of our work. iGem is my first research experience and has been an invaluable part of my education.
About Umaryland
