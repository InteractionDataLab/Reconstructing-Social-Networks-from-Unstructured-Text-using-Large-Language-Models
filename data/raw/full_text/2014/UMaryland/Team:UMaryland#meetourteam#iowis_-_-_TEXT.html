Iowis Zhu:
 
I am a junior Biochemistry/Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics double major at the University of Maryland, College Park. My interests lie in scientific research as well as science education. I have also served as a tutor in the biological and physical sciences since my time in high school and I currently hold a position at the university as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA).   To commemorate my middle school science teacher's retirement, I committed the periodic table to memory. I still haven't forgotten it :)
