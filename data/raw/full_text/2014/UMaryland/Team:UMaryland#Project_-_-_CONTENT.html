    The Chesapeake Bay is Maryland’s most important natural landmark, housing a diverse ecosystem of plants, animals, and microbes. The Bay is also an economic
    boon to the state, as it is a major source of seafood as well as a popular tourist destination along the eastern seaboard. Over time, however, the Bay has
    been beset by environmental problems, which have steadily decreased water quality and economic output. For instance, the local oyster population in the bay
    has dropped to less than twenty percent of its original numbers (“Gem of”, 2008). Since oysters serve as natural water filters, this oyster deficiency has
    exacerbated the recent decrease in water clarity as well as the increase in chemical pollutant levels, both severe concerns for the Chesapeake Bay.
</P><P><U>What is Causing this Decline?</U></P><P>
    A major biological reason for this decline has been the spread of an oyster pathogen called <EM>Perkinsus marinus</EM>, a unicellular protist also known as
    “Dermo” (Espinosa, Winnicki, &amp; Allam, 2013). Dermo has been shown to infest oysters by entering their hemocyte cells, a type of immune cell, via
    induced phagocytosis. When inside the hemocyte, the parasite is capable of resisting the reactive oxygen species generated by the oyster immune system.
    This leads to proliferation inside the oyster hemocyte, eventually lysing the host cell and releasing more Dermo to restart the cycle (Allam et. al.,
    2013). This process leads to massive tissue damage and the eventual death of the oyster.
</P><P><U>Our Research Interests</U></P><P>
    The mechanism of the initial induced phagocytosis involves binding between Dermo surface carbohydrate residues and CvGal1, a carbohydrate binding receptor
    used for food and pathogen recognition that is found on oyster hemocytes. This receptor traps the parasite and initiates phagocytosis (Tasumi &amp; Vasta,
    2007). Our initial goal is to create a recombinant <EM>E. coli </EM>expressing CvGal1 that would be an effective real-time biosensor for Dermo presence.
</P><P><U>Our Research Plan</U></P><P>
    Binding of Dermo to this receptor would be coupled with the overexpression by <EM>E. coli </EM>of green fluorescent protein, thus creating a visual marker
    for the parasite. This would be generally accomplished via genetic cloning and bacterial transformation.
</P><P>
    Although laboratory methods for Dermo detection using PCR exist, they are currently not capable of detecting the disease in real time. In the time needed
    to conduct a laboratory test, Dermo could have easily spread to many more oysters or have moved to a new location. This biosensor would help to accurately
    pinpoint Dermo location and infestation levels in water and oysters in real time. If we can pinpoint the location of Dermo, as elucidated in this research
    proposal, then we can ultimately develop a biosensor that can react to Dermo with targeted destruction.
</P><P><U>Our Goals</U></P><P>
    The long term goal of our research team is to create a bacterial biosensor that not only detects Dermo but initiates its own “defense” response.
    Preliminary ideas for a response involve the release of antiprotozoal agents or inhibitors of ascorbate peroxidase—one of Dermo’s enzymes used to resist
    reactive oxygen species (Schott, Pecher, Okafor, &amp; Vasta, 2003). While the health of the Chesapeake Bay oysters largely influences the Bay’s ecosystem,
    the detrimental effects of Dermo extends to all eastern oysters—the most harvested species of oyster in aquaculture. Our aims reach further than the task
    of protecting the Chesapeake Bay, we propose a mechanism that would protect all oyster populations along the eastern shore and in oyster farms worldwide
    from Dermo. This project is expected to last over several years and will be continued by future generations of undergraduate researchers.
</P><P>
    Along with our research, we will also conduct various community outreach efforts to spread awareness on the current state of the Chesapeake Bay, as well as
    ways individuals can help and maintain our greatest natural resource. This will involve the team traveling to schools and community centers throughout the
    state. We also have a committee dedicated to creating an educational computer game that teaches others about the issues that the Chesapeake Bay currently
    faces. It is our team’s hope that our research results to be presented at the iGEM jamboree will ultimately have a profound and positive impact on the
    health of the Chesapeake Bay and oyster populations worldwide.
