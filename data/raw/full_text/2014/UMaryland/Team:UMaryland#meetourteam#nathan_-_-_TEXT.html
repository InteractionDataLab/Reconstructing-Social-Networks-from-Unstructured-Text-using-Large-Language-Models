Nathan Barber:
 
Pursuing a graduate degree, then a career in biomedical engineering, hopefully reaching management. I'm participating in iGem because I'm fascinated with the impact we can make on the world as only college students. Fun fact: I've free climbed a 30 ft cliff outdoors with no ropes or harness.
