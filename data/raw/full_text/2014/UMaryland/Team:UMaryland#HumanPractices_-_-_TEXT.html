Human Practices
We having been traveling around Maryland conducting various community outreach efforts by visiting local schools and oyster farms. During each visit, members present our project and spread awareness on the current state of the Chesapeake Bay, as well as ways individuals can help service the Bay. Some presentations are made on synthetic biology to increase student participation and interest in the sciences. We also have a committee dedicated to creating an educational computer game that teaches others about the issues that the Chesapeake Bay currently faces. It is our team’s hope that our research results to be presented at the iGEM jamboree will have a profound and positive impact on the health of the Chesapeake Bay and oyster populations worldwide.
