Pavel Vlasov:
 
After finishing college and graduate school, I plan on going into research in genetics, preferable involving medical research and/or genetic engineering. I joined iGEM to expand my experience working in the lab and to apply my skills to novel genetics work, in addition to my existing interest in the techniques required here. My ultimate goal with both this team and my own work as a whole is to make a truly important contribution to both the field of genetics and to people's everyday lives. Fun fact about me: One of my hobbies is building models, everything from tanks and aircraft to sci-fi robots.
