We Would like to thank all who have helped make this year possible!
 
A Special Thanks to the following contributors:
Dr. William Bentley
Distinguished professor and chair, Fischell Department of Bioengineering University of Maryland
Dr. Bentley was helpful talking through the initial stages of the project, representing the schools Bioengineering department and getting out name out to campus, as well as a major supporter of the project, in addition to providing lab instruments, resources, and offering cellular constructs.
 
Dr. John Buchner
Lecturer, Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics University of Maryland.John Buchner is lecturer and lab coordinator for general microbiology, and a lab coordinator for microbial genetics. His microbiology class is in I Series courses at UMD. He is a member of the HPI group, a faculty collaboration intent improving the educational experience of undergraduates, and publishing the findings. John is also a Chesapeake Fellow, and is dedicated raising awareness of sustainability to the students he teaches, and reducing material consumed in his classes.
 
Dr. Buchner was instrumental in helping our students design the project, providing many insights into how proteins function through the cell membranes, as well as signal transduction pathways.
 
Dr. Ben Woodard
Director, Biotechnology Research and Education Program
Director, Bioprocess Scale-up Facility
Dr. Woodard was a valuable research throughout the planning phase of the project, providing insight on the potential commercial aspect of the product and keeping our team on track with realistic expectations.
 
 
John Wilhelm III
Regional Sales manager at Integrated DNA technologies
Mr. Wilhelm provided a wealth of knowledge regarding the creation of our constructs and the different options availible, as well as introducing us to synthetic gene construction. IDT was responsible for creating our G-Blocks used for CVGAL1 and Bovine Galectin-1
 
Dr. Gerardo Vasta
Professor, Department of Microbiology and Immunology University of Maryland School of Medicine
Dr. Vasta was extremely helpful with our questions regarding Dermo, specifically the ligand CVGAL1 and the interaction between Dermo and E.Coli as well providing strategies for expressing and optimizing this protein.
Dr. Osnat Herzberg
Professor Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry University of Maryland at Shady Grove
Dr. Herzberg contributed to our protein design, offering to check our sequences and provided insights into the bovine-galectin that we created.
A Special Thanks to the Following Departments/Laboratories:
The Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics
A special thanks for Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics for offering us a lab space throughout the duratation of the summer in which we conducted our research.
 
Dr. Kahn's Laboratory
A special thanks to The Kahn Lab group for offering us lab space throughout the fall semester, providing additional materials we needed for research and offering storage space. Additionally Dr. Kahn and Dr. Quimby performed the ran the final western blot which was included in our results
Dr. Bentley's Laboratory
A special thanks to The Bentley Lab group for permitting us the use of their facilities,including multiple analysis machines without which we could not have completed our research, providing enzymes and other research materials.
 
Dr. Eisensteins Laboratory
A special thanks to the Eisenstein Lab group for providing us with research materials, as well as allowing us to run experiments at their location

About Umaryland
UMaryland 2014 is the inaugural iGEM team of the University of Maryland, College Park. We are a combined effort of several departments and numerous faculty mentors. Although it is only our first year, we believe our hard work and dedication has paid off. We can't wait for this year's competition! GO TERPS!
