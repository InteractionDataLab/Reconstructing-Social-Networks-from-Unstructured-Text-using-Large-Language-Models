1.Bronze
Team registration done.
Our completed Judging form.
Our beautiful wiki has been finished as you see.
We will present our poster and project at iGEM Jamboree October and November 2014
Our Biobricks.
2.Silver
New BioBrick Part and Device of our own design and construction works: BBa_K1325008;BBa_K1325009;BBa_K1325010;BBa_K1325012;BBa_K1325013;
BBa_K1325014;BBa_K1325015.
We have documented the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of our Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
We have submitted this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Our projects involve important questions relating to biosafety and biosecurity. To see our project and safety to learn what we have overcome.
3.Gold
We have characterized an existing BioBrick Part(BBa_I739002)
We helped iGEM team: Tianjin by characterizing their parts.
We described and constructed an approach (E.co-Lock) that our team used to solve the problems of biosafety and biosecurity.

Measurement of parts
BIT-China collaborated with Team Tianjin in the measurement of their parts.
They send their sample of K1361007 to us, in which CsgA, the major subunit of curli fiber modified by twin 7Xhis tag, is under control of a strong constitutive promoter BBa_J23100. And the K1361007 was arrived in company with a parallel part where BBa_J23104, a relatively weaker promoter, replaced the BBa_J23100. In order to find the better fit of promoter, we measure the cell growth curve of each part and Bradford protein assay was adopted to monitor the total quantity of secrete protein in matrix.
Cell growth curve of BBa_J23100 and parallel that a relatively weaker promoter was used to control the CsgA secrete level.
This figure shows the absorbency of secrete protein in culture between K1361007 and parallel. No significant divergence was found.
2.Tianjing for BIT-China
Model of MIN system
Tianjin Team use a classical model, density-dependent growth model, for helping BIT-China to stimulate population of E.coli growing. Also they use some other differential equations to describe the dynamic change of AHL, LuxR proteins and MinC proteins. The total equations are as follows:
Then they use these equations to simulate the function of MIN system. The results are shown as figure 1 and figure 2.
Figure 1. The dynamic change of cell number and total number of LuxR proteins. After a sharp increase, the cell stopped multiplying themselves. With the growing of E.coli, the total number of LuxR proteins also increases. The initial value of cell number we set is 3000.
Figure 2. The dynamic change of MinC proteins and AHL signal. The AHL decrease very quickly with the growth of E.coli. And when AHL comes to the threshold value, the repression of MinC is removed. So after some time the MinC proteins increase quickly and the cell division process is inhibited.
