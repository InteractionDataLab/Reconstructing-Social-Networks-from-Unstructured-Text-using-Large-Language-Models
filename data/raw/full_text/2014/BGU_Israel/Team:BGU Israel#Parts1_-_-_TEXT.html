HSP70 Promoter
A human promoter that induces expression in response to heat stress.
DsbA-L
An ER protein assisting in the synthesis of high molecular weight adiponectin.
Adiponectin
An insulin sensitizing hormone with beneficial metabolic effects.
UCP1
A trans-membrane mitochondrial protein which decreases the proton gradient generated in oxidative phosphorylation, and produces heat in the process.
HSP70 Promoter
Heat  shock proteins (HSP) are a key part of the heat shock response in almost all  organisms, from bacteria to humans. Their expression is induced drastically  when cells expose to stress such as elevated temperature, heavy metals or  starvation. The 70 kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) are a family of conserved  ubiquitously expressed heat shock proteins. Like many other HSPs, HSP70 is an  important part of the cell's machinery of protein folding. Its role is to  prevent the aggregation of partially synthesized peptides or damaged proteins.
The  HSP70 promoter can be regulated by at list two distinct domains, a distal  domain which contains sequences responsive to heat shock and cadmium stress,  and proximal domain necessary for transcription stimulated by serum. The  activity of the promoter can be induced by moderate hyperthermia (39°C to  43°C), metal induction or by addition of serum after starvation (Wu, Kingston, & Morimoto, 1986).
Using  this promoter allows thermal induced expression in human cell lines.
This  promoter’s sequence was taken from Invivogen pDRIVE-HSP70 ( http://www.invivogen.com/pdrive-hsp70 ).  Since it contained two forbidden restriction sites, we changed the second base  from C to G and the 339th base from T to A.

Human DsbA-L Gene
Brief introduction Of DsbA-L:
DsbA-L  is a protein present in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum). Its main action is a Glutathione  S-Transferase action on the hormone adiponectin. It has the ability to  catalyze the conjugation of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) to xenobiotic  substrates for the purpose of detoxification, and it helps with binding two  substrates with to s-s bonds and cellular detoxification.
DsbA-L  is expressed mostly in adipose tissue, and its expression level is negatively  correlated with the obesity of mice and humans.
DsbA-L has been shown to bind adiponectin and  increase the production of the HMW species, for that it can become a novel  therapeutic and industrial target.
Modularization  of DsbA-L:
The  DsbA-L sequence had iGEM Restriction sites that had to be change according to  iGEM protocol.
In  position 131 G was changed to A to avoid Pst1 Site.
In  position 446 A was changed to T to avoid Pst1 Site.
In  position 467 A was changed to T to avoid Pst1 Site.
In  position 545 C was changed to G to avoid Pst1 Site.
All changes in nucleotides was done according to an  amino acid chart to maintain the same amino acids at the protein sequence  Level.

Human AdipoQ Gene
Brief introduction Of  AdiopQ:
The  AdipoQ gene which codes for the protein adiponectin has domains similar to collagens X and VIII and complement factor C1q.  Adiponectin forms multimeric complexes that combine via its collagen domains to  create three major oligomeric forms: a low molecular weight (LMW) trimer, a  middle - molecular weight (MMW) hexamer, and high molecular weight (HMW) 12-18-  mer Adiponectin.
Normally  it is expressed exclusively in adipose tissues from which it is secreted to the  blood stream. It directly sensitizes the body to insulin and has an important  role in lipid and glucose metabolism regulation. Therefore adiponectin  represents a potential therapeutic target to fighting obesity-linked diseases  characterized by insulin resistance and the Metabolic Syndrom.
Furthermore low levels of serum Adiponectin is  highly related with occurrence of abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, type 2  diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome

UCP1 (Uncoupling protein 1)
Brief introduction Of UCP1
A transmembrane protein naturally present in mitochondria of brown adipose tissue. The gene itself is found in the nuclear genome, and after translation it is sent to the mitochondria.
UCP1 increases the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to protons, allowing them to move from the inner membrane space to the mitochondrial matrix, bypassing ATP synthase.This process weakens the coupling of the electron transport chain to the production of ATP.  In an attempt to raise the pH gradient negatively affected by UCP1, a fast oxidation of substrates occurs while the synthesis rate of ATP stays low and oxidation energy is released as heat instead.
UCP1 is activated in the brown fat cell by fatty acids and is inhibited by nucleotides.
