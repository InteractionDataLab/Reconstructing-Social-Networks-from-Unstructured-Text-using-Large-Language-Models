Overview
Purpose: Construct the most suitable scRNA, for the following mechanism.
Figure 1 –  ‘Intelligent Medication’ scRNA mechanism
Figure 2- Lengths of subsequences
We wrote a python program which can create the required scRNA, basing on online and offline calculations. The program gets the trigger gene and the target gene as inputs. The output of the program is a list of scRNAs (A•B) and their detection targets (X), that predicted to be the most effective for this mechanism, considering the trigger and target genes.
How It Works
Main Goal:
Finding X, A and B that will make the optimal distinction between OFF and ON states:
OFF state - minimal  production of Dicer substrate B in the absence of detection target X, the  presence of mRNA silencing target Y, or the presence of mRNA off-target Z.
ON state - strong  production of B in the presence of short RNA detection target Xs  (‘a-b-c’) or full-length mRNA detection target X.
Steps:
From the target gene (given  as an input), find an appropriate sub-sequence to be the silencing target with a  length of |y|+|z|, and consequently define y and z.
For each optional sub-sequence with the length of X  (|a|+|b|+|c|), of the trigger gene (given as an input), do:
Define this sub-sequence as X.
Split X into three parts,  and consequently define a, b and c.
Define A = z · c* ·  b* · a*.
Define B = z · c* ·  b · c · z* · y*.
Scoring the complex  of A·B (scRNA) and X. **
Create a list of all the scRNAs (and their mRNA detection target  X), sorted by descending score, and set it as the output. The scRNA with the best  score is the first.
* - Reverse complement.
** - Using an external online service.
Scoring a scRNA A scRNA’s score consists of two components:
ScoreOFF (OFF state) – the relative concentration of duplex A•B in the absence of X.
ScoreON (ON state)  – the relative concentration of hairpin B in the presence of X.          We tried to find a simple scoring function which can describe the suitability of a scRNA in a proper way. There are two simple functions which are candidates for the scoring function, summation and multiplication.          We can see it in the following example:
The idea of this score is that we  don’t want a situation which a high score component compensate the other  component, this is due to the nature of the mechanism (both states are equally  important, with interdependency). Therefore, we chose multiplication as the  scoring function:
The scRNA’s total  score = ScoreOFF * ScoreON
External online services usage:
InvivoGen - for finding an appropriate  sub-sequence for mRNA detection target.
NUPACK Server - for analyzing secondary  structures and finding the concentration of complexes.
User Manual
System Requirements:
Python 3.x installed.
Internet connection.
Free space of a few  gigabytes (depends on the trigger gene length).
Running the program:
The program consist of two  python files that can be downloaded from here:
scRNA.py , serverHandlers.py .
Put the two ‘.py’ files (“scRNA.py”, “serverHandlers.py”) in the  same directory.
Create two files in this directory:
Trigger file (e.g. “trigger.txt”),  which consist the trigger gene sequence.
Target file (e.g. “target.txt”), which consist the target gene sequence.
Open the command window and  run:
> python  scRNAalgo.py trigger_file target_file
During the running of the  program, it creates a set of all the results from the servers in the directory,  for calculation purposes. After the program ends, an appropriate message will  appear on the screen and the results will be written into the output file.
Output File (Results):
During the running, the program  creates a directory which called “All Results” (if it not exists). In this  directory the program will create a sub-directory for every run, with the time  and date that make up its name. After the run, this sub-directory will contain  all the data that the program has processed of every potential scRNA.
The output file is located in ‘All  Results/000000000000 run/000000000000 run - Output.txt’
The output consists all of the  scRNAs the program analyzed, in descending order by the total score. A single  scRNA will showed like that:
Score: %%%%%%%%
A: %%%%%%%%%
B: %%%%%%%%%
X: %%%%%%%%%
How We Used It
We ran the program on the  following sequences, located in the two input files:
Trigger gene sequence - Apolipoprotein3

Results Analysis
Analysis of the chosen scRNA
We chose the first scRNA, and verified the results  by putting A and B together in an identical concentration, with and without the  trigger gene.
OFF state (without trigger)
No concentration of B (0%) - this is a very good  OFF state.
The duplex A·B is the only complex (100%) that formed from A and B:
Figure 3- The secondary structure of duplex A·B
ON state (with trigger)
There is a concentration of 50% of B and 50% of X·A.  That is to say, all of the B forms will transform into hairpins, and will look like  in the figure below:
Figure 4- The secondary structure of B
The A which has  separated from B, assembles, along with X, the complex X·A:
Figure 5- The secondary structure of complex X·A
Conclusions:
We used the  program we wrote in the design and test of our scRNA mechanism. It helped us to  choose the scRNA we wanted to test in our lab, among a very large number of  potential scRNAs, and is also even spared us the manual analysis of a single  scRNA. We offer the code to of the program as open source, from the notion that  it can help anyone who want to design the same mechanism we used, for other  purposes. Of course the program is adjustable to the needs of any objective,  with a different trigger gene and a different target gene.
