Collaboration with the Technion iGEM group
Detection of allergens and toxins in food and water has been one of the  most major global challenges in recent years, mainly because its detection must  be done at very low concentrations. In order to tackle this challenge, the  Technion-Israel team is designing a bio-sensor system that can accurately  identify a substance of interest at extremely low concentrations. The system  consists of E.Coli Top 10 bacteria which are able to sense the presence of a  specific substance and process the signal to produce a green light. In order  for the green light to be visible to the naked eye, the system involves a  quorum sensing-based acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) signal as well.
The AHL  signal is passed on from one E.Coli to its neighbors in order for them to  follow suit, causing a chain reaction which enables the magnification of the  green light signal.
To  determine whether their E.Coli Top 10 bacteria do produce and secrete AHL, we  offered to characterize their system using the reporter strain chromobacterium violecium 26 (CV026) which we have in our lab. In the presence of AHL, CV026 produce a  characteristic purple dye marker. In a qualitative experiment that we conducted  by seeding their E.Coli Top 10 on soft agar and LB agar plates containing  CV026, we found that their bacteria do produce AHL as a result of purple  colonies that appeared on the agar plates. Such result helped the  Technion-Israel team to insure that their system does secrete the AHL signal.

UT Dallas Collaboration
We sent the UT-Dallas team a part, that has been created by the iGEM BGU 2013 team, BBa_K1223010 (pUC-57-P.A.S.E.1), as this part wasn't available in the registry.
