        Prevention measures - healthy cooking workshop and  early detection glucose tests for Bedouins spouses. Balanced nutrition and  early detection are key factors in preventing type 2 diabetes. </DIV><DIV class="textCont" style="float:left; width:512px; margin-right:11px"><H3 style="text-align:center;">Check Out the Gallery   </H3></DIV><DIV class="textCont" style="float:left; width:512px; margin-right:0px"><H3 style="text-align:center;">Check Out Our Achievements   </H3></DIV><DIV class="textCont" style="height: 1300px;"><H3 style="border-bottom:dashed;border-color:#000000">Overview </H3><DIV class="col2"><P>Some groups are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and the  metabolic syndrome, than others. All over the world, groups of indigenous  people are far more likely to develop the disease due to a rapid urbanization  process and the adoption of modern lifestyle. The Bedouins in Israel provide us  with a no different story.
            Populations of Indigenous people all over the world have shifted from  traditional to modern-western lifestyle that includes less physical outdoor  work, and increased consumption of industrial foods. This, in addition to low  socio-economic background, leads to today findings – indigenous people, such as  the Aborigines in Australia, suffer type 2 diabetes far more than any other  group. 
          The  Bedouins are an ancient indigenous subgroup within the Arab minority in Israel  with cultural, historical, social and political uniqueness, mostly located in  the Negev desert (southern Israel), very close to Ben-Gurion University. The  Bedouin community has changed drastically, once nomad tribes, now living in  concrete houses in concrete cities. Urbanization and adopting modern lifestyle  pushed Bedouins to change their diet almost entirely, and abandon the nomad way  of life, leaving grazing and agricultural work to a more convenient city lifestyle.  By meeting with Dr. Abu Rabia, the first Bedouin doctor in southern Israel who  was a tremendous source of knowledge, we have learned that this  &quot;convenience&quot; led to a terrible yet amazing fact – in 1960, type 2  diabetes almost did not exist amongst the hard physical working Bedouins, while  in 2002 findings show that the presence of the disease in the Bedouin community  is significantly higher than in the Jewish sector and twice as much as any  other peripheral group. In only 40 years, the Bedouins climbed all the way from  the bottom, up to the top of the infamous list of type 2 diabetes risk groups.</P></DIV><DIV class="col2"><P>Awareness is key, yet hard to find  in the Bedouin community. We can see how lack of awareness is reflected in many  Bedouin day-to-day habits, and by that, could drastically affect the failure of  prevention and development of type 2 diabetes. Until recently, being diabetic  was actually considered shameful in the Bedouin community. As a result, people actively  avoided taking proper treatment. From a religious perspective, Bedouin women  tend to stay at home, and avoid being seen in any open-air activity, even a  casual stroll in the streets. These cultural-religious habits and others add to  the risk of developing the disease, which with the proper awareness could  improve the prevention and eventually lower the number of type 2 diabetes cases  amongst Bedouins. But even when Bedouin diabetics do go to clinics to get  medical care, many of them still refuse being treated with insulin, mostly due  to the perceived shame of that act.
          The Inner Doctor treatment (like genetic engineering) is an advanced,  more difficult to understand and accept by the patient. Providing the Inner  Doctor solution could be much complicated in a community that rejects a basic  insulin treatment, or fails to understand the daily lifestyle that could lead  to diabetes, all due to lack of information and awareness. Therefore, we  understood that this fundamental obstacle has to be removed in order to have  the Bedouin more open and willing to use our solution, more aware of the  implications of diabetes and what causes it, and by that, take an action, first  towards prevention, and second, by getting the right treatment if needed. This  is the complete solution of the Inner Doctor.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="textCont" style="height: 570px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><H3 style="border-bottom:dashed;border-color:#000000">Metabolic Ambassador </H3><DIV class="col2">
          We organized a seminar for 40 Bedouin students in medical  professions, which received the knowledge and motivation to start taking action  and raise awareness for Diabetes in their communities. The lectures we  organized gave tools and inspired them to keep learning about this subject, and  we also handed out brochures in Arabic for them to share within their social  networks and communities. To make an everlasting effect, together with the Dean  of Students <EM>Prof</EM>. <EM>Moshe</EM> Kaspi we  successfully established scholarships (up to 70%  of tuition) for 8 students who would volunteer in Diabetes Clinics in  their communities: helping, treating and guiding patients, while learning  themselves and gaining experience in the process. We also met with the CEO of  the diabetes association in Israel Mr. Moti Peralmuter and arranged a scholarship: a position for a  Bedouin student as the branch manager of the association in the southern Negev. <DIV style="width=120px; float:left; text-align:center; font-size:12px; font-weight:bold">

I was happy to help the iGEM BGU team making the  seminar happen for 2 reasons: to raise awareness among the younger generation  who will be able to bring great change in the Bedouin society,  and second, for  my opinion, the INNER DOCTOR solution can really help people who have diabetes  and metabolic syndrome&quot;.</B></DIV></DIV><DIV class="col2"><DIV style="width=120px; float:left; text-align:center; font-size:12px; font-weight:bold">

There was also a patient who came to  tell his personal story dealing with Diabetes, and we couldn't have done it  without a nursing student who helped make this day happened. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="textCont" style="height: 340px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><H3 style="border-bottom:dashed;border-color:#000000">Healthy Cooking Workshop </H3><DIV class="col2">
         Balanced nutrition is a key factor in keeping a  healthy lifestyle and inhibiting diseases, especially when talking about type 2  diabetes. In addition to our bio-engineered Inner Doctor, we set goals for a  more complete solution. One that will include a treatment, but just as  important, awareness for prevention steps of diabetes. With the corporation of  the Israeli Diabetes Association and a local clinic in Rahat, we have  organized a healthy cooking workshop and early detection glucose tests for  Bedouins spouses. Rahat is the largest Bedouin city  in the world, and above all reflects the massive Bedouin urbanization  process. The women who attended the occasion all have at least one diabetic  relative under their care. </DIV><DIV class="col2"><P>During the workshop they got plenty of great  tips on how to cook and consume healthily. With completion of the workshop,  they all had the opportunity to be checked and diagnose their glucose level. It  is important to understand that early diagnose is crucial, since once you get type  2 diabetes you cannot go back.  
           A major goal for this day was to create a  strong link between the clinic in Rahat and the Israeli Diabetes Association.  That was gladly achieved as this day was announced to be an annual event from  now on, which will continue promoting healthy cooking and early diagnose  awareness long time after the iGEM 2014 competition will end.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="textCont lineh" style="height: 420px;"><H3 style="border-bottom:dashed;border-color:#000000">Gallery </H3><DIV id="galleryContainer"><BUTTON id="leftButton" onclick="moveLeft()">&lt;</BUTTON><BUTTON id="rightButton" onclick="moveRight()">&gt;</BUTTON><DIV id="caption">Photo Caption</DIV><DIV id="loading">Please wait...</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="textCont" style="height: 430px; margin-bottom: 12px;"><H3 style="border-bottom:dashed;border-color:#000000">Achievements </H3><UL class="check"><LI>	We arranged 2 big events within the Bedouin community, in order to provide necessary knowledge and raise awareness and motivation for saving lives by taking an action.</LI><LI>	We managed to create new scholarships for 8 Bedouin students who will volunteer in the diabetes clinics in the community.</LI><LI>A scholarship for a Bedouin student, in order to open, for the first  time, a branch of  the Israeli Diabetes Association in Rahat </LI><LI>Strong cooperation with DR.

         It was important to us to learn about the Bedouin society and understand the causes for the high rate of diabetics in the community when compared to other sectors. Therefore, we have consulted with experts within the society itself and mapped the barriers for making a real change.
We discovered a major problem of awareness, and lack of motivation to take action and save lives. </DIV><DIV class="col2">
      All the events that we organize had a goal of dealing with these barriers and set the ground for a more open-minded treatment (like our Inner Doctor) that might be implemented in the future. We wanted to avoid one-time events, and for that we involved potential partners along the way, who will be willing to continue the cooperation and execute more events long after the competition.
