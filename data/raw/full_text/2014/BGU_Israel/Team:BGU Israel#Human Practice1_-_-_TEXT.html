How can we as a group, bring well targeted true value to the people  we are trying to help with our research?
"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts" ―  Aristotle
We discovered who are the  individuals suffering from the Metabolic Syndrome, and really got to know them and their needs. We learned about the figures and entities around us and did our best to invest our time and energy in real long-lasting contribution with the goal of making the world a better place.
Note: Statistics  show that 1 in 4 people worldwide suffer from the Metabolic Syndrome, yet there  is no organization for them. This made them unavailable for us to reach, and  led us to choose diabetic as our exemplifiers (Diabetes being a prime symptom  of the Syndrome).
Who are the people who might benefit from our new treatment?
A very emotional interview with a person struggling with diabetes
See what ethical issues our project might face
What will it take to get our project up and running?
How will our project be affected by laws and vice versa
