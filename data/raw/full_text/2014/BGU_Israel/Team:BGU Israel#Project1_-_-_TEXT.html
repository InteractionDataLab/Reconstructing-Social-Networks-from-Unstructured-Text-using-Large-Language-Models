Intelligent   Medication
Western modern lifestyle brought us a lot of wonderful   innovations, but also many problems. Today, about 25% of the adult world   suffers from the Metabolic Syndrome. This syndrome is a cluster of   medical conditions, including: abdominal obesity, elevated blood   pressure, Insulin resistance, high blood triglycerides and more.         These medical conditions are interconnected and are a result of   complex metabolic pathways, meaning most traditional drugs used to treat   them have undesired side effects. We intend to utilize synthetic biology   in order to develop novel strategies for the treatment of metabolic   syndrome.
Realizing the complexity of the Metabolic Syndrome, we envisioned the   need for multiple treatments. Our Inner Doctor combines four novel   strategies, offering treatments based on synthetic biology, with each   strategy addresses a different aspect of the metabolic syndrome. Our   Intelligence Medication decreases insulin resistance in a tissue specific   manner; Aspiration Shift reduces non-adipose fat accumulation; Artificial   Exercise will increase the energy expenditure of the body; The Hormone   Workshop will have an overall positive metabolic influence.
