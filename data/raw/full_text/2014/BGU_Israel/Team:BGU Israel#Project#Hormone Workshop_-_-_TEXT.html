Backgroud
The Problem: Abnormal aggregation of fatty acid in non-adipose  tissues, particularly skeletal muscles and liver
The Goal: Reduce insulin resistance and improve the metabolism  of metabolic syndrome patients
Mechanism
The most active form of the Adiponectin is a high molecular weight complex. The synthesis of the protein subunit and an enzyme for disulfide bonds should improve the levels of the active form of the hormone.
Background
Adiponectin is an adipocyte derived protein  hormone showing insulin - sensitizing effect and has an important role in lipid  and glucose metabolism regulation. Hypoadiponectemia (low levels of serum  Adiponectin) is highly related with occurrence of abdominal obesity, insulin  resistance, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. Adiponectin forms multimeric  complexes that combine via its collagen domain to create three major oligomeric  forms: a low molecular weight (LMW) trimer, a middle - molecular weight (MMW)  hexamer, and high molecular weight (HMW) 12-18- mer Adiponectin. The form  showing the most relevant properties considering insulin sensitivity and  protection from diabetes is the HMW form of the hormone (Kadowaki et al., 2006).
Adiponectin oligomeric forms
Mechanism
When one is diagnosed with the metabolic  syndrome's symptoms and shows low levels of serum Adiponectin, an efficient  treatment could be a pill or a shot containing the active HMW form of  Adiponectin hormone. However, there is no known efficient synthetic method to  produce the desired multimer structure of the hormone. It has been shown that overexpression  of the enzyme DsbA-L (disulfide-bond A oxidoreductase - like), promotes  Adiponectin multimerization, while suppressing its expression by RNAi markedly  and selectively reduced Adiponectin levels and secretion in adipocytes (Liu et al., 2008).
In order to synthesize the HMW form of Adiponectin,  we intend to introduce overexpression of both Adiponectin and DsbA-L in our  model cell line HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma). This is expected to produces  high levels of HMW Adiponectin while relying on the natural hormone secreting  ability of hepatocytes and excretion tags on the hormone itself.
In the future, we intend to attach the  hormone to an inducible system to allow for more control on the proteins  synthesis.
