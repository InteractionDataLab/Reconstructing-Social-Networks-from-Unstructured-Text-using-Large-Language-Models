Supervisor
Smadar Cohen
Prof. Smadar Cohen from the Avram and Stella Goldstein-Goren Department of Biotechnology Engineering, Ben Gurion University, received her BSc, MSc and PhD (Biophysics) from Tel Aviv University, and went on to a postdoctoral fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (with Prof. Robert Langer). Prof. Cohen’s research explores several areas in modern biotechnology, from designing of instructive biomaterials   for inducing tissue regeneration and tissue engineering ex- and in-vivo to implementation of intelligent delivery systems for therapeutic peptides and proteins. AlgiMatrix– a scaffold for 3-D cell culture – has been developed in her group and has been licensed and developed into a product by Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, California). Prof. Cohen also developed BL-1040, an alginate-based biomaterial for treating acute myocardial infarction (in clinical phase I /II study).
Us As a Team
Our team started with 10 students, strangers to each other, trying to build a project together. We came from different departments in Ben-Gurion University, each one of us with his role in the group, and all of us together with a lot of motivation and one main goal- to come with the best project as iGEM BGU 2014 team. Soon we found that each one of us could learn how to help the others and outreach his specific role. We consulted, helped and enjoyed each other's company during the way.
We have learned that working together as a team can earn us some amazing friends and take our project to new heights.
We had a great time and we are proud of the outcome.
