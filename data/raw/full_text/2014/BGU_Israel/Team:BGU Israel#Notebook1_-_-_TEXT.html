Validation of co-expression of mRuby2 and eGFP in CT26 eGFP cell line
Goal: A preliminary experiment to validate we can visualize the co-expression of both mRuby2 and eGFP in CT26 eGFP cell line using confocal microscopy.  Method: 20,000 cells were plated in each well of a chamber slide and incubated for 24 hours at 37?c. 4 wells were transfected with pcDNA3-mRuby2 using Lipofectamine 2000 (protocol), and incubated for 48 hours at 37?c. The other 4 wells were mock transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 and incubated in the same conditions for negative control. After 48 hours, the transfected cells were viewed at the confocal microscope.  eGFP: excitation - 488 nm, emission - 509 nm  mRuby2: excitation - 559 nm, emission - 600 nm
Results:
Co-expression of mRuby2 and eGFP. All three pictures show the same cells. Picture A shows only eGFP expressing cells, picture B shows only mRuby2 expressing cells, and picture C show all cells.
Conclusions:
mRuby2 and eGFP were co-expressed in CT26 eGFP cells and viewed successfully using confocal microscopy.

Functional silencing experiment
Goal: Silencing eGFP in CT26 eGFP cells co - transfected with pcDNA3 mRuby2 and our scRNA construct. The scRNA construct is designed to be activated by mRuby2 mRNA, becoming a dicer substrate and finally silence eGFP.   Method: We gave a different treatment for each of our four groups:
We conducted the experiment both in 24 well plate (for flow cytometry) and in a chamber slide (for confocal microscopy).
The cells were plated on the appropriate plates for the different tests (100,000 cells per well in the 24 well plate and 15,000 cells per well in the chamber slide) and incubated for 24 hours at 37?c.
After 24 hours, the incubated cells were transfected (according to the different treatments detailed above) with one or more of the following:
pcDNA3 mRuby2 -  1.0 µg
scRNA – both detection part A + hair pin part B - 100 pmol for each of the parts (A+B)
Transfection was done by lipofectamine (protocol), and then the cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37?c.
Preparations for image stream were done by the general protocol (protocol).
Results:
Image stream (flow cytometry):
Treatment 1 – Negative control
Treatment 2 – transfected with pcDNA3 mRuby2
Treatment 3 – transfected with scRNA
Treatment 4 – transfected with pcDNA3 mRuby2 & scRNA
Confocal microscope:
Co-expression of mRuby2 and eGFP was validated in all relevant wells.
Conclusions:
GFP negative population: The  first parameter to compare that comes to mind when looking for silencing is the  percentage of GFP negative cells of the entire population – if a significantly  bigger portion of the population is GFP negative, then the silencing worked.  However, when looking at the population distribution of the different control  groups, we can see no significant difference in the GFP negative population.  This might not the result of unsuccessful silencing – we are using a stable GFP  expressing cell line, but no matter how stable it is, always there will be a  portion of the cells that do not actually express GFP. Additionally, a  successful silencing is not expected to completely shut down the expression of  GFP in single cells. This creates the necessity to evaluate the expression of  GFP using another parameter.
Mean intensity of GFP  positive cells: This parameter will show difference between a negative control  and a successful silencing in light of the above. However, cells treated with  scRNA showed only a very small difference in this parameter, so we could not  observe a successful silencing.
For the next try, the following changes were implemented:
double the amount of scRNA in the  transfection
Change the protocol of  preparing Lipofectamine – scRNA mix to allow for better interaction between the  2 parts of the construct, and prepare the Lipofectamine- DNA mix separately.

Goal:  A second try of silencing eGFP in CT26 eGFP cells co - transfected with pcDNA3  mRuby2 and our scRNA construct. The scRNA construct is designed to be activated  by mRuby2 mRNA, becoming a dicer substrate and finally silence eGFP. 
Details:
The  changes concluded from former results:
Half of calls amount was  seeded (50,000 cells per well)
The cells were transfected  with double amount of scRNA:
pcDNA3-mRuby2-  1.0 µg 
 scRNA – both detection part A + hair pin part  B- 200 pmol for each of the parts (A+B)
This time, the lipofectamin  mixes were prepared separately for the pcDNA3-mRuby2 and for the scRNA (both A  and B parts together), so that both of the mixes will make its content ready  and prepared for transfection.
The  rest of the protocol remained unchanged ( protocol ).
Notes:
During this  transfection a mistake occurred. In one of the plates, an incorrect of volume  of Lipofectamine-scRNA was added due to a measurement error. Consequently, this  plate had unknown concentrations of nucleic acids and lipofectamine, with a  positive deviation in volume.
Results:
Most of the cells  died, probably due to the increased volume of Lipofectamine that was added by  mistake.
Biobricks
Goal:  The ordered parts for Biobricks preparation had arrived in the weekend  so preparations of plates and medium for the Biobricks construction were done.
Details:
LB agar plates with  ampicillin (100 µg/ml) or Chloramphenicol (25 µg/ml) were made following the LB  agar plates protocol .
SOC medium for bacterial transformation was prepared. SOC medium  content is:
0.5% (w/v) yeast extract
2% (w/v) tryptone
10 mM NaCl
2.5 mM KCl
20 mM MgSO4
Glucose 20%

Biobricks-
First trial - the DNA parts that were used  in Biobricks preparation are: Adiponectin (pUC 57 Adiponectin), DsbA-L (pUC 57 DsbA-L), HSP70  promotor (pUC 57 HSP70), HSP70 promotor (with modifications) (pUC 57 HSP70  modified), UCP1 (pcDNA3.1 UCP1) and pSB1C3 backbone. The process included-  transformation -> extraction and creating a glycerol  stock-> restriction-> gel electrophoresis-> gel products  extraction-> ligation-> transformation.
Details:
DNA  parts and backbone were digested with restriction enzymes: Pst1 and EcoR1
The  transformation was done according to the general  transformation protocol .
At  first, heat-shock transformation to chemically competent BH5? bacteria with the following  DNA parts (separately):
pUC 57 Adiponectin
pUC 57 HSP70
pUC 57 HSP70 modified
pUC 57 DsbA-L
pcDNA3.1 UCP1
The  transformed bacteria were incubated for 24 hr at 37?c.
After  24 hr incubation, colonies from each plate were transferred to liquid medium  and incubated for 24 hr at 37?c.
Plasmid  DNA was extracted using a miniprep kit and concentrations were measured using  nanodrop.
The  plasmids were digested with restriction enzymes Pst1 and EcoR1, following general  restriction protocol .
The  digested DNA parts were tested by gel electroporation, following general  gel electrophoresis protocol .
Results:
The  wanted bands didn’t appear on the gel.
Conclusions:
Since  the desired results didn’t appear on the gel, it was assumed that the  restriction didn’t work. The reason is probably technical inexperience of using  restriction enzymes and inappropriate pipetation and spin down absence.
Intelligent Medication
Goal:  Third try of trying to silence eGFP in CT26 eGFP cells – this time we also made  a positive control with anti eGFP siRNA from our lab. Additionally we  simplified the silencing process – using our mechanism, if transfected with 2  parts of the RNA construct silencing will take place only in the presence of a  specific mRNA. This time we used only one part (part B – hairpin) that is  supposed to have a silencing effect without the presence of the specific mRNA.  We also tested our samples for silencing using RT PCR and flow cytometry (Image  Stream).
Details:
The  changes concluded from former results:
Added positive control and  used only part B hairpin:
Anti eGFP siRNA - 200 pmol
scRNA part B hairpin - 200  pmol
Seeded cells amount was  doubled, back to 100,000 cells per well.
The  rest of the protocol remained unchanged ( general  lipofectamin protocol ).
Results:
Image stream:
scRNA  part B (hairpin) only
Positive  control - anti GFP siRNA
Negative  control-
Representative  image stream pictures:
RealTime PCR:
The housekeeping genes showed unstable expression and thus could not be  used as reliable control, rendering the results of the entire experiments  unreliable.
Conclusions:
The mean intensity in the  GFP positive population of the positive control (anti GFP siRNa) is lower by 28  % of that in the negative control. However, this sequence was tested before and  resulted in much higher silencing rates. With this, and in addition to previous  results, we assume that flow cytometry, the way we use it, tests silencing in  the protein level. Therefore it is likely that the proteins (eGFP is known to  be stable) in the sample did not have enough time to degrade. Therefore, it was  decided that image stream is not efficient test for the scRNA experiments and  the appropriate test would deal with mRNA levels.
The treatment containing  scRNa part B only (hairpin silencing sequence) didn't show any lower GFP  intensity in the GFP positive population, concerning the negative control.
It was assumed that as  image stream Real Time PCR results: Since the housekeeping genes showed  unstable expression no significant result could be drawn regarding neither gene  expression nor gene silencing from the RealTime PCR this time.

Biobricks-
Trying again the experiment from September 7th.
Details:
DNA  parts and backbone were digested with restriction enzymes: Pst1 and EcoR1
The  transformation was done according to the general  transformation protocol .
At  first, heat-shock transformation to chemically competent BH5? bacteria with the following  DNA parts (separately):
pUC 57 Adiponectin
pUC 57 HSP70
pUC 57 HSP70 modified
pUC 57 DsbA-L
pcDNA3.1 UCP1
The  transformed bacteria were incubated for 24 hr at 37?c.
After  24 hr incubation, colonies from each plate were transferred to liquid medium  and incubated for 24 hr at 37?c.
Plasmid  DNA was extracted using a miniprep kit and concentrations were measured using  nanodrop.
The  plasmids were digested with restriction enzymes Pst1 and EcoR1, following general  restriction protocol .
The  digested DNA parts were tested by gel electroporation, following general  gel electrophoresis protocol .
Ligation  products were transformed by heat-shock to chemically competent DH5? bacteria, plated on cmp LB  agar plates and incubated for 24 hr at 37?c.
Results:
All parts were successfully restricted (unfortunately  the picture taken was not in good quality).
No  colonies grew on the plates.
Conclusions:
Since  no colonies grew on the plates, but restriction went well, the problem might  lie either in the ligation process or the competent cells. For the next try, a  new competent cells stock was used.
Biobricking  third try:
Details:
DNA  parts and pSB1C3 backbone (from pSB1C3 RFP and pSB1C3 amilcp) were digested  with restriction enzymes: Pst1 and EcoR1
The  ligation and transformation was done according to the previous protocols.
Results:
All parts were successfully restricted but  again, no colonies grew on the plates.
Conclusions:
Since  no colonies grew on the plates even though different competent cells stock was  used, and restriction went well, we assume that the competent cells are not the  problem and for the next try, we would use a new DNA ligase.

Forth trial, first for this week – With a  new ligase enzyme, the rest of the process is identical to the last times.
Details:
DNA  parts and backbone were digested with restriction enzymes: Pst1 and EcoR1
The  transformation was done according to the general  transformation protocol .
Results:
Restriction  gel:
No colonies  grew on the plates.
Conclusions:
Since  still unsuccessful. We will try a different kit for purifying restriction  products.
Fifth trial, second for this week
Details:
DNA  parts and backbone were digested with restriction enzymes: Pst1 and EcoR1
The  transformation was done according to the general  transformation protocol .
Results:
All parts were successfully restricted, but again no  colonies grew on the plates.
Conclusions:
Since  a lot of changes was already done, and the time became critical for iGEM  deadline, it was decided to try looking for a different lab and get some help.
Sixth trial,  third for this week – with the former changes, we moved to Prof. Lital Alfonta's  lab, using the lab members' knowledge and experience. The transformation was  changed from Heat-Shock transformation to electroporation transformation.
Details:
DNA  parts and backbone were digested with restriction enzymes: Pst1 and EcoR1
The  transformation was done according to the general  transformation protocol .
The  gel products extraction, ligation and transformation was done at Prof. Lital Alfonta's  lab with instruction of her lab members.
Results:
All parts were successfully restricted,  electroporation time contants were all above 5 ms, but again no colonies  grew on the plates.
Conclusions:
We will try again with the same settings and a  different insert to vector ratio.

Biobricks-
Seventh and last trial, first for this week – with the former changes, working in different lab the insert vector ratio has  been changed.
Details:
The  transformation was done according to the general  transformation protocol .
Protocol  changes:
Transformation by  electroporation.
The gel products  extraction, ligation and transformation was done at Prof. Lital Alfonta's  lab with instruction of her lab members.
This time, the insert to  vector ratio was raised to 4:1 instead of 3:1
Results:
The  restriction worked, but again- No colonies grew on the plates.
Conclusions:
Since  it was the last chance for preparing and sending the Biobricks to iGEM, unfortunately  we have no more time to try and make this work. We suspect that step that  prevented successful transformation was the ligation.
Intelligent Medication
Goal:  Fourth try of trying to silence eGFP in CT26 eGFP – we repeated the exact  protocol form the third try, but this time we will only try to analyze results  by real time PCR.
Details:
Same  as in third try.
Results:
The results were analyzed USING THE ??CT method. The cells transfected with our scRNA hairpin contained only 44.4% eGFP mRNA in comparison to untreated cells (with a high standard deviation of 26.1%), while cells transfected with our positive control siRNA contained 38.2% mRNA.
Conclusions:
The ability of our scRNA hairpin to perform silencing when it is unbound by the detection part of our construct is of crucial importance. These results show that it can silence a gene of interest, and in a similar efficiency to that of our positive control. However, the high standard deviation, will require us to repeat the experiment. It is also important to note that the efficiency of both samples is affected by the transfection efficiency, which is dependent of the transfection reagent. Optimizing the transfection might lead to better results and higher silencing efficiencies.

Artificial Exercise
Goal: Use TMRM (tetramethylrhodamine  methyl ester) to assess the ability of UCP1 to collapse membrane potential. Membrane  potential-driven accumulation of TMRM within the inner membrane region of  healthy functioning mitochondria results in a dramatic increase in  TMRM-associated orange fluorescence. When the mitochondrial membrane potential  collapses TMRM is dispersed throughout the cell cytosol at a concentration that  yields minimal fluorescence upon excitation in the optimal wavelength region.
Details:
HepG2  cells were seeded in a 24 well plate (75,000 cells per well) and incubated for  24 hours at 37?c.
After  24 hours, in 3 of the wells the cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 UCP1 using  Lipofectamine, and incubated for 24 hours at 37?c.
Then, the cells were dyed with TMRM:
The overnight medium was  aspirated.
Three different concentrations  of TMRM 10 µM were added to 4 wells without any treatment: 0 nM, 10 nM, 25 nM,  50 nM, by adding 1 ml of medium DMEM with 0 µl, 1 µl, 2.5 µl, 5 µl of stock  solution respectively .
Incubate for 30 min in  37?C.
The medium was replaced to DMEM without phenol red, 0.5 ml in each  well.
Same treatment was done  with 3 wells of pcDNA3.1 UCP1 transfected HepG2 cells.
The cells were viewed in a  fluorescent microscope (excitation – 545 nm, emission – 575 nm).
Results:
The  left series of pictures shows HepG2 cells treated with TMRM of different  concentrations (left – white light, right – fluorescent), and the right series  shows HepG2 previously transfected with pcDNA3.1 UCP1 as described above, also  treated with TMRM of different concentrations.
There  appears to be no visible difference between cells transfected with pcDNA3.1  UCP1 and the normal cell line. Also there was no difference between the  different concentrations of TMRM, so next time we can use the lowest one (10  nM) or perhaps even lower.
Conclusions:
Using fluorescent microscopy with TMRM is a  semi-quantitative method for the assessment of mitochondrial membrane  potential. It could be that even if UCP1 was correctly expressed, it didn’t  lower the membrane potential enough for us to see. Next time we could use  spectrometry to more quantitatively assess the function of UCP1. Additionally,  many times fatty acids are used for the activation of UCP1. We didn’t use fatty  acids this time, and it might be the reason for the inactivation of UCP1.
