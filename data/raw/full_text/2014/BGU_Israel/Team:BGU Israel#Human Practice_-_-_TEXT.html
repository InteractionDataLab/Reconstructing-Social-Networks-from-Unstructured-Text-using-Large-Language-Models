Treat How?
Western modern lifestyle brought us a lot of wonderful innovations, but also many problems. Today, about 25% of the adult world population (and over 40% of the adult western population) suffers from the Metabolic Syndrome. This syndrome is a cluster of medical conditions, including: abdominal obesity, elevated blood pressure, Insulin resistance, high blood triglycerides and more. 
These medical conditions are interconnected and are a result of complex metabolic pathways, meaning most traditional drugs used to treat them have undesired side effects. We intend to utilize synthetic biology in order to develop novel strategies for the treatment of metabolic syndrome. By addressing the causes of the syndrome rather than its symptoms.
