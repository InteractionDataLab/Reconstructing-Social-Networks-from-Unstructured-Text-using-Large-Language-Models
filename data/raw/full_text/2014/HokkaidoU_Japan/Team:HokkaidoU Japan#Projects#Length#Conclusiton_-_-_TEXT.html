Future Work
In this results, we confirmed the repression efficiency of anti-sense is related to the length. Therfore, we can make many kinds of repression efficiency anti-senses by making some length anti-sense. However, to synthesize many kinds of anti-senses, we must prepare each primers. As a future work, we prpose an efficient method to synthesize various length anti-sense.
Method
Here, we explain this method by using mRFP expression construct as a target gene.
