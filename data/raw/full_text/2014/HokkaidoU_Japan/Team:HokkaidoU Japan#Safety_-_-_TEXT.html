Dangerous chemicals
Chloroform
corrosive and toxic : must be used in fume hood
Ethidium Bromide
intercalating agent : must be used with personal safety gear
Ethanol
flammable : must not be used near open flame or in large quantities
Liquid Nitrogen
cryogenic container and cryogenic gloves must be used
Procedures and equipment
Agarose gel production
heating in sealed container (rupture risk), scalding hot and vicious during preparation (burn injury risk) - remove container lid before heating in microwave, use safety gear, wait for a few moments before removing from microwave
Benson burner
fire risk: DO NOT use flammable materials especially ethanol near open fire
Centrifuge
high velocity: balance appropriately, observe the machine till it reaches top velocity
Autoclave
high pressure: check the water level, DO NOT open when pressurized
UV radiation
damage to eyes and skin: use glove and UV box or UV shield
Non-pathogenic bacteria (policy requires treating as pathogenic, as precaution)
JM109
DH5alpha
Both of these are lab safe strains. As a precaution all materials coming in contact are sterilized before and after.       Reference Federal Register, (1986) Vol. V1: 88, 6952–16985
Safety equipment
Gloves
Coats
Goggles
UV Box
UV shield
Waste disposal and sterilization
All equipments and wastes coming in contact with bacterial are sterilized by autoclave or bleach.
All chemicals compounds are disposed according to requirements for their disposal.
All table surface used for work are sterilized with 70% ethanol before and after a procedure.
Chemical Usage
All chemical compounds are used according to their manuals and respective material safety data sheet
Genetic material
Risks to the safety and health of team members, or other people working in the lab:.
All lab staffs are trained according to safety manual provided by Hokkaido University.       We took on ourselves to compile a shortlist of often used dangerous materials and safety procedures in our project.
Risks to the safety and health of the general public (if any biological materials escaped from your lab):
Devices which we made, do not code odd proteins. There are no risk by themselves.
Risks to the environment (from waste disposal, or from materials escaping from your lab):
Biodevices which we made, do not code odd proteins. There are no risk to environment.
Risks to security through malicious mis-use by individuals, groups, or countries:
Our project is about improving antisense RNA system to be useful. They don’t code odd proteins.
What measures are you taking to reduce these risks? (For example: safe lab practices, choices of which organisms to use.)
Our projects are only related to antisense RNA system. They are not toxic substances nor substances that influence nature. Therefore that designs are not need.
Risks of Your Project in the Future
Our project aims to make silencing system more efficient by using antisense RNA. There are no risk because the system leads to only control expression of proteins.
Safety training we received
We all received a lecture class regarding gene recombination that was held in Hokkaido University we belong to. It is based on ’Act on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms’ , ’Regulations related to the Enforcement of the Law concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms’ and ’The Ministerial Ordinance Providing Containment Measures to Be Taken in Type 2 Use of Living Modified Organisms for Research and Development’ , Japanese laws.
