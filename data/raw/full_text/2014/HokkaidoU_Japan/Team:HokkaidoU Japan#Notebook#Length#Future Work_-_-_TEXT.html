Colony PCR
Mon Sep 1
sequenses are unknown because of randomizing(on pHN1257) pHN1257_up_F Tm:60.1&#8451 & as_RBS_XhoI_R Tm:68.2℃ Kapa-Taq
Complete!
We could not get hoped result though we got some colonies. However, stem region has a problem that PCR is not performed well. It is possible that the constructs were complete.
