iGEM Japan
We attended the 86th Genetic Society of Japan and had a discussion with 8 Japanese iGEM teams (Gifu, HokkaidoU, Kyoto, Nagahama, Osaka, TMU-tokyo, Tokyo-tech, and UT-tokyo). Our topics were how iGEM Japan would be in the future and reached a consensus of our apporopriate cooperation. We had a good oppotunity to exchange information and to deepen our friendship.
Special thanks
Nobutaka Nakashima [ Lab HP ]
Department of Biological Information, Tokyo Institute of technology as an associate Professor. He offered his original vector expressing stemmed-antisense RNA and gave us some advice.
Tomohiro Tamura
Research Group of Novel Microbial Functions,  Hokkaido University as a guest professor.  We referenced his article about antisense. He was a colleague of Nakashima. He mediated between Nakashima and us, and also gave us some advice.
