Mike / mRNA
The most popular boy in the village, but a little indecisive.
Rachel / ribosome
The most confident girl in the village. She loves Mike and approaches him positively.
Cupid / HokkaidoU
A wonderful sprite in the village. He sometimes helps a villager whimsically.
Once upon a time, there was a girl, Annie. She fell in love with Mike who was the darling of the town. But she had a formidable rival, Rachel. She was very positive to her love so that she always wanted to monopolize Mike.
Contrasting to her, as Annie was too shy, it was difficult for her only to approach to Mike. Nevertheless, she never stopped thinking about Mike. Cupid found such poor Annie
As Cupid wanted to help Annie’s love, he casted a spell over her. This was the wonderful magic STEM. Enchanted her clothes turns into greatly beautiful clothes.
She was very surprised to look at herself in a mirror because the girl in a mirror appeared like not herself to her. Owing to wonderful magic, she was able to have confidence and a little courage to go to Mike.
