asmRFP(on pHN1257) & B0034-E1010-B0015(on pSB6A1)
2.5µL each to DH5α Turbo
Asssay(unsuccess)
Wed Aug 13
Culture asmRFP(on pHN1257) & B0034-E1010-B0015(on pSB6A1)
1. 2mL LB with 100µL 100mM IPTG  2. 2mL LB However, IPTG was too much to grow normally.

Thr Aug 14
Culture asmRFP(on pHN1257) & B0034-E1010-B0015(on pSB6A1) E. coli was early growth 1. 2mL LB with 20µL 100mM IPTG 2. 2mL LB However, pLac was inducible promoter that is promoted by IPTG. We decided to retry this examination.
