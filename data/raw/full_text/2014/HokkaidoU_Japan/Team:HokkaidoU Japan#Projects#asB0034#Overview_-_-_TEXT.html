Overview
Anti-sense RNA is studied actively over the world. However, reliable method for gene silencing has not been clear. It is hard to find efficient sequence of anti-sense RNA and to synthesize new anti-sense fragment in keeping with your target gene.
fig1. you have to change anti-sense RNA conforming with each target gene.
We have a good idea! It is useful to use common anti-sense for different target gene.
fig2. Image of common anti-sense RNA effects.
Here we found that anti-sense-RBS (B0034) fragment, which is used by many iGEMers commonly, works to silence several proteins. We synthesized anti-sense B0034 fragment. Regardless of target gene, only one anti-sense fragment, anti-sense B0034, works on B0034 and repress the expressions of various proteins if they are regulated by B0034.
We also synthesized anti-sense-B0032 fragment in order to achieve specific gene silencing. You can change the target protein by changing the combination of anti-sense fragment and RBS locating upstream of target gene.
Specific anti-sense-RBS fragment helps you save labor to make new anti-sense RNA for each target genes. Fortunately, iGEM HokkaidoU team select tractable RBS for designing anti-sense-RBS fragment. You can use our anti-sense fragments without resynthesizing your constructs. What you only have to do is to add our anti-sense fragment to the construct with the target gene!!

How to synthesize anti-sense constructs
Anti-sense RBS fragment was synthesized by primer annealing. Based on BioBrick standard, anti-senes RBS was flanked with scar sequences. Moreover, the ends of anti-sense fragment have restriction enzymes recognition sites, NcoI and XhoI. After finishing synthesizing anti-sense RNA, we ligated anti-sense RNA with H-stem construction by NcoI and XhoI.

How to assay
We selected mRFP for target gene. We used fluorophotometer to measure how anti-sense worked. The colonies transformed by anti-sense RNA and target gene was used for assay.
To cultivate the colony in 4 mL LB culture for about 20 hours
To control turbidity up to 0.1 at OD600
To cultivate the colony in 2 mL M9ZB culture for 9 hours (IPTG induces antisense RNA, addition 20 uL)
To measure fluorescence after 9 hour
