Poster and a talk for the iGEM Jamboree are ready and obey new 2014 poster guidelines
We descripted all attributes clearly in our project, referring to the iGEM 2011 Imperial College Acknowledgements page.
We built, characterized, and documented several new parts: BioBrick
Silver
We experimentally validated that several new BioBrick Parts or Devices of our own design and construction work as expected.
We documented the characterization of those parts in the “Main Page” section of those Part’s/Device’s Registry entries.
We submitted those new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We consider problems about ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights .We considered our problem in Safety and Discussion .
Gold
We improved the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device, enter this information in the Registry.
We collaborated with eight teams as iGEM Japan in The 86th Annual Meeting of The Genetics Society of Japan in Nagahama, Shiga. From HokkaidoU, five members joined to this event.
We described a new approach that our team used to address some questions and evaluate our approach ; Safety and Discussion .
