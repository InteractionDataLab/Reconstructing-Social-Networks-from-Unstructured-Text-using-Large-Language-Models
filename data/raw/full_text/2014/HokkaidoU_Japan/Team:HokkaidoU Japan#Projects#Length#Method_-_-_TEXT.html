How to synthesize anti-sense constructs
Anti-sense fragments were synthesized based on BioBrick by PCR. Forward primers are common (XhoI-Ptet (-10)). Each reverse primers are different (as90 NcoI, as120 NcoI) (Fig. 1). As90 is the anti-sense that covers 90 bp of mRNA, and as 120 is the anti-sense that covers 120 bp of mRNA (complement RBS and a part of mRFP sequence.) Because of these, we got various length anti-senses. The sides of antisense fragment have restriction enzymes XhoI, NcoI sites.

"swipedown" : "swipeup" );      }       // trigger swipe events on this guy      $.each($.event.find(delegate, events, selector), function(){       this.call(entered, ev, {start : start, end: stop})      })          }    }    // reset start and stop    start = stop = undefined;   }) });  })(jQuery)
