Team Information
Some of the team!
LA Biohackers is a diverse and eclectic community of amateur scientists and science enthusiasts in Los Angeles, California. We have created a laboratory where people can learn, discuss, explore and experiment. Whether they're working on their own biology projects and experiments, or simply curious about what's new in the exciting world of biology, from autodidacts to autotrophs, all are welcome!
Our mission is to make science accessible to people of all ages and educational backgrounds. We've helped graduate students from Cal Tech explore the possibility of using directed evolution to create bacteria which generate nitrogenase, local high school students researching telomeres, and hardware hackers monitoring neurons in real time. And we're just getting started!
