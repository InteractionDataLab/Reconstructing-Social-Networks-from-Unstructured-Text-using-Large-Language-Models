Nobody puts Baby in the corner
LA Biohackers would like to thank SnapGene and MatLab for donating software, New England Biolabs for donating a BioBricks kit, and the Intellectual Property Investment Law Group for travel funds.
Without their support, our participation in IGEM 2014 would not have been possible.
