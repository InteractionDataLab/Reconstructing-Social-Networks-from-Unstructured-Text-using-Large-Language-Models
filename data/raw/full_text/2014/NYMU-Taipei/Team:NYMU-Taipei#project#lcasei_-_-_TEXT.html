Probiotic-Lactobacillus casei
Summary
Recombinant Lactobacilli are developed to serve as a bio-safely organism, in the hope to express heterologous proteins in oral therapeutic applications.
In our project, caries nemesis "HOPE", we use Lactobacillus casei as our final host of the recombinant plasmid, which contains the promoters and the desired genes like YebF and Orf19. Orf19 and YebF are signal peptide and lysing protein which respectively derive from M102 phage and E. coli MG1655. Also, low oxygen and acid environment were set as the initial condition to turn on the gene promoters of our recombinant plasmid. We therefore gain an access to do conditioned expression of killing and anti-biofilm genes in L. casei.
However, the isolation of plasmid DNA from G+ lactobacilli is complicated by resilience of the peptidoglican layer.
For this reason, it is a relatively feasible and reliable way that we use E. coli as our testing bacterium of “HOPE” but the functional promoters and genes of the shuttle vector will be eventually transformed into our probiotic L. casei, which is safe to use as a food-grade protein expression and secreting system.
Get started.
How to do it?

Reference
Before we get started:
The Gram positive L. casei., LB23
The purpose of our study attempts to construct an E. coli-Lactobacillus shuttle vector plasmid with an expression cassette consisting of a strong promoter, a signal sequence, and a heterologous model protein gene. We put the plasmid inE. coli, our testing bacterium to conform the feasibility of our study and finally the plasmid will be inserted into L. casei in "HOPE".
Generally, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are regarded as safe and useful commensal bacteria, which are known as probiotics and starters for food fermentation. In recent years there has been an upsurge of interest in the genetic manipulation of lactic acid bacteria (LAB).
Many studies on Lactobacillus casei subsp. have been carried out using the plasmid-free strain BL23, ATCC 393 (pLZ15-)[4]. BL23 and its relatives have been used as a host for genetic modification and applied for live delivery agents. For example, the single chain variable fragment of an antibody that binds to a major adhesion molecule of Streptococcus mutants was expressed on the cell surface and showed protective effects against colonization with the pathogen [5]. Thus, it is clear that the development of a highly efficient protein-secreting system in this strain would be important and beneficial.
Moreover, L. casei might be a better live delivery agent because the optimal growth temperature of L. casei is the same as the body temperature of mammals. Thus, BL23 is no doubt a suitable bacterial host for our food-grade protein secreting system in “HOPE”.
So how did we do it?
Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions
L. casei BL23 and recombinant strains were grown in Mann-Rogosa-Sharp (MRS) medium at 37℃.
Erythromycin (5 μg/ml) was added to MRS for the selection of recombinants L. casei strains. For pH control, 50 mM carbonate buffer was supplemented into the medium at certain ratios (NaHCO3:Na2CO3). The commonly used cloning host of E. coli DH5α (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) was grown in LB with or without 100 μg/ml ampicillin. L casei, BL 23 were maintained in a 10% glycerol stock collection at -80 °C and were subcultured in MRS medium (Oxoid) when required.
Bacterial strains used in this study:

Construction of Plasmids and Transformation of
L. casei
The sequences of all PCR primers used in this study are listed in the following Table 2. PCR products and plasmids were digested with restriction endonucleases followed by ligation and transformation to E. coli DH5α. In the cloning of E. coli DH5α we used a high copy number plasmid named E. coli, pUC19 After harvesting L. casei plasmid by digesting pUC19, we use a E-coli-Lactobacillus shuttle vector, pLP402, to perform our desired features. And the transfer process was carried out by electrophoresis.
