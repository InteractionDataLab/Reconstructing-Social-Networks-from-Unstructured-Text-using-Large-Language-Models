Even though we were troublemakers sometimes, she was still willing to give us good advice and let us try out various experiments in the lab. During those experimental times, we are really grateful to her for all her great help and care. </P><P>  Jesse Wu (吳傑熙) taught us a lot, such us biobricking, using wiki, paper searching and so on, during the lecture learning. He is a really nice guy, and has patience to help us solve different machine and computer problems. The knowledge he has taught is very useful. He is our great teacher and always willing to answer our strange questions. With his help, our project could be much more special! </P><P>  Yang, Chih-Hsien (楊志賢) also taught lecture for us. He taught us modeling, and guide us to use Octave to present our experimental results. We are also very thankful to him!</P><P>  Su, Tzu-Yi (蘇子懿) is a 1st-year Master Program student of Institute of Oral biology. He often gave us lots of advice about oral cavity. He also taught us how to cultivate ''<I>Streptococcus mutans</I>'' and provided us machine and introduced us to have a project discussion with his instructor Dr. Wu, Ching Yi (吳靜宜).
