Achievements
GOLD requirements
Improved the integrity of existing parts and documented several function tests of our new parts and existing parts.
Mutually collaborated with NTU_Taida iGEM team on lab data, and helped two local high school iGEM teams.
Launched an Oral Excursion Team in order to promote and spread ideas about synthetic biology and our project HOPE (Human Oral Protection for Everyone), Scientific American magazine published also one of our articles about iGEM ,about HOPE and NYMU-Taipei.
Actively consulted with the committee of FDI World Dental Federation (a federation of approximately 200 national dental associations and specialist groups), and they decided to promote HOPE at this year’s dentist world assembly.
SILVER requirements
Experimentally validated Biobricks of our team design and constructs worked as expected success.
We documented and characterized parts in our iGEM team wiki page section and Parts registry.
Submitted new parts to iGEM Parts Registry.
We valued our project heavily in the aspect of bettering human oral hygiene, therefore, we visited and consulted the chair of ADS-ROC (Association for Dental Science of the Republic).
BRONZE requirements
Formed an iGEM team.
Completed judging form.
Constructed our fancy Wiki pages.
Poster and talk were readied for the iGEM Giant Jamboree.
Biobricks were built, improved and documented by our team.
HUMAN PRACTICE
Discussion with legislator about legal issues.
Discussion with Taiwan's biggest anti-GMO organization and professor about ethical issues.
Promotion and discussion of HOPE in a conference of World Dental Federation.
Wrote an iGEM article on Scientific American Taiwan.
Promotion on social media and gave speeches to help promoting and establishing new iGEM teams.
Questionnaire helped model the impact of HOPE in Taiwan.
Video clips and booklets made.
Oral hygiene social service performed.
WIKI
Met wiki requirements and documented comprehensively.
Made interactive mascot guide, Toothy.
Dynamic loading pages, which resulted in more smooth while loading pages.
Introduction video made.
MODELING
Tried many new methods for parts and project simulation.
Based mainly on experimental measurements, which makes our model more realistic.
Helped wet lab in results prediction and parameter finding.
Cooperated with Human Practice group, made use of the survey data to analyze about the impact of HOPE.
Have models in molecular level, cellular level, environment level, and even for economics, which provided a comprehensive modeling for our project.
