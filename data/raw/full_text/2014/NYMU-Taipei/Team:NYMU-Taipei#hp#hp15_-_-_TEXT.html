What is synthetic biology and iGEM?
Your browser does not support HTML5 video. You can Download it.
Our team came up with the idea of promoting iGEM and synthetic biology by making a video clip. Since hoping the students in our school can identify with our video clip, we decided to film scenes of our campus, including the cafeteria and convenience store. Furthermore, after a brief introduction of what synthetic biology can do, we presented our project, HOPE.
The animation is a combination of thousands of photos of our own drawings. In order to make this animation, we had pushed ourselves to the limits for weeks. During the process, we had great fun although feeling extremely tired.
