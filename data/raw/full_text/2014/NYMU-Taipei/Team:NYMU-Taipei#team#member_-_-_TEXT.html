Team members
   Team 2014 NYMU-TAIPEI was a gather of 19 iGEM beginners when it was formed in early 2014, however this far, we found ourselves maniacs in synthetic biology. In the past several months, we have been trying to develop a sustainable and auto-controlled way to cure caries, which may be a good blessing for the elderly and toddlers.
   Cherishing every mistakes and possibilities we have explored, we humble learners are grateful in front of knowledge and our helpers. In some day we hope, may all our dreams break into blossoms.

No matter how much or how difficult her work is, she will make effort to it and lead to a wonderful result. She also did well in making short films, which are very lovely! We love to work with Ruby!
   Chen, Hung-Wen 陳鴻文
In IGEM team, Bill takes charge of the sponsorship, human practice and advertisement. He shots a nice sponsoring film to boost our presence before hundreds of iGEM teams. In human practice, Bill establishes the fan page and keeps updating the news on it. Not only human practice but also the circuit design of our part, he always analyzes the project logically and gives us some practical ideas. Hardworking and high efficiency are the best adjective of Bill.
   Leon Yim
Leon Yim is a high school student at Taipei American School (TAS), Taipei. He is very enthusiastic and interested in how synthetic biology works and how it can be used to tackle common problems. He joined the 2014 NYMU-iGEM team and is working on engineered E.coli in the current project for the S.mutans and the Biofilm problem. In the future he wants to engineer and design new circuits with various applications.
   Peng, Jui-Hui Patrick 彭睿輝
Patrick had been studying in Canada during high school. He can idle away a whole day simply being a bookworm, spending time with fierce dragons in magical kingdoms. Even without food and water, an e-book is enough to make his world go round. Patrick is talented in drawing. He designed our poster and pictures on the 2014 NYMU wiki page.
   Evonne Pei
Evonne is a eleven-grade student from Taipei American School. She's a cute younger sister in our team and brought up our working atmosphere. In spite of her young age, she worked hard and contributed a lot in our team.  Not only did she helped in the experiments in wet lab, she also gave us a lot of help in English communication, such as presentation and documental works.
   Kidane Desta Gebreyesus
Kidane is a PhD student at the Institution of Biomedical Informatics in NYMU. He has MSc degree in Mathematical and Statistical Modelling. In our team, he is hard-working in the Modelling part to obtain appropriate Mathematical models to model parameter determinations and simulations. Also, he is expected to contribute in the analysis and statistical tests of our experimental data.

Acknowledgements
All of the works, including experiments, wiki, modeling, human practice, are done by the students in our team. Instructors and seniors helped us on brainstorming, parts check, modeling methods advice, human practice supports, and so on. Except that the background image of wiki is helped by a friend of a team student. The sponsors and other institutions that have helped us are listed on the footer of our wiki page.
General support
Dr. Chang, Chuan-Hsiung (張傳雄), Dr. Li, Wan-Chun (黎萬君), Dr. Chang, Ching-Fen (張菁芬) and Mr. Jude Clapper are the main mentors of our team. During the preparation, lecture learning and brain storming, they helped us a lot. They guided us and always gave us different kinds of views to think about.
Dr. Chang, Ching-Fen (張菁芬) trained us to use the wet lab for iGEM experiments, and she always has immense patience to help us and teach us. Even though we were troublemakers sometimes, she was still willing to give us good advice and let us try out various experiments in the lab. During those experimental times, we are really grateful to her for all her great help and care.
Jesse Wu (吳傑熙) taught us a lot, such us biobricking, using wiki, paper searching and so on, during the lecture learning. He is a really nice guy, and has patience to help us solve different machine and computer problems. The knowledge he has taught is very useful. He is our great teacher and always willing to answer our strange questions. With his help, our project could be much more special!
Yang, Chih-Hsien (楊志賢) also taught lecture for us. He taught us modeling, and guide us to use Octave to present our experimental results. We are also very thankful to him!
Su, Tzu-Yi (蘇子懿) is a 1st-year Master Program student of Institute of Oral biology. He often gave us lots of advice about oral cavity. He also taught us how to cultivate ''Streptococcus mutans'' and provided us machine and introduced us to have a project discussion with his instructor Dr. Wu, Ching Yi (吳靜宜). Frankly, it helped a lot. We are very appreciate Su, Tzu-Yi (蘇子懿) and Dr. Wu, Ching Yi (吳靜宜) for their help.
