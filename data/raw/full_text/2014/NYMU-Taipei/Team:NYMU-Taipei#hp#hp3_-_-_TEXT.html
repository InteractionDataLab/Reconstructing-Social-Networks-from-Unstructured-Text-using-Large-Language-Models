Legislator Tien Chiu-Chin
Tien, Chiu-Chin
Legislator of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Foundation Chairwoman, Yilan Branch, Taiwan Environmental Protection Union
Convener, Thermal Power Union, Taiwan Environmental Protection Union
Executive Secretary, Yilan County Anti-Sixth Naphtha Cracking Plant Association Director General, Qilan Cypress National Park Promotion Association
Legislator in Nationwide, 6th and 7th Legislative Yuan
Note: A Legislator in Taiwan is roughly equivalent to a U.S. Congressman, or a Member of Parliament (MP) for other countries.
What do you think of synthetic biology?
"I understand that synthetic biology can bring lots of benefits to our world, including cultivating artificial organs and other pharmaceutical uses. Yet, in this case for example, wouldn’t it be better to educate and encourage the public to donate organs?"
"What I am concerned about is the possibility that the rich might monopolize the market for artificial organs, depriving the less-affluent of their right of accessing medical care. Additionally, the genome of these synthetic biological products might be released into the outside world."
"However, synthetic biology is quite a new field in the industry. Thus, it will not be easy for us to implement a specific law to put restrictions on unethical experiments. Self-discipline will be the most important industrial guideline for synthetic biology in the near future."
What do you think of genetically modified foods?
"Modifying a crop involves the process of inserting a gene of another species. It may be genes from a plant, an animal, or even from germs! Doesn’t this sound rather unnatural and against the order of the universe?"
Since Professor Kuo is an expert and professor of the department of agronomy in National Taiwan University, we decided to have a further discussion about GMOs.
What do you think of “HOPE”? Are you willing to use “hope” to prevent cavities if our project has been realized?
"Lots of experiments have affirmed the harmful effects of GMOs, and it is our duty to protect the citizens from hazardous food. In my opinion, the most reasonable way is to see every GMO product as a possible threat from the beginning, and require them to undergo various testing in order to prove its safety. Only then can it be sold to the market."
"At the very least, I am in favor of labeling GMO products clearly, and thus giving customers a chance to choose."
What do you think of HOPE? Are you willing to use hope to prevent cavities if our project has been realized?
"Since I have visited patients with cerebral palsy, I can definitely sympathize with the difficulty of self-care for these populations, such as brushing their teeth. It will be a real blessing for the disabled if HOPE were to be brought to the world."
Implementing laws for synthetic biology and GMOs
"To propose a new law or policy for the congress, one has to do numerous research on similar laws abroad. Thus, these laws can be seen as a example for us. With other countries forcing these laws, it will also be easier for us to learn from their experience. In addition, to pass a law for synthetic biology requires professional advice and support. The academic field will have to cooperate with the law makers."
Our first visit to the Congress of Taiwan
Visiting legislator Tien was an amazing trip for our team, for it was the first visit to the Legislative Yuan (the Taiwanese Congress) for all of us. We took our time exploring the hallways and corridors open to visitors. The legislator, though usually a fierce debater on television, is actually a down-to-earth and approachable politician!
