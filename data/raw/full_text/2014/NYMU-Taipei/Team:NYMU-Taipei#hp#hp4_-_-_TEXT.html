The Importance of HOPE
"WHO (World Health Organization) has recently called for stronger focus on the health conditions of elders.” Dr. Ming Lun Hsu informed the NYMU students. The slogan "Good health adds life to years" marks the importance of aging and health, the theme of the 2012 World Health Day. In Addition, on the Global Oral Health Programme (ORH), WHO has been trying to prevent increasing cases of tooth decay by promoting oral health policies.
Moreover, HOPE has a great significance in Taiwan. “According to the statistics, the decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) index for 12-year-olds is 2.58 teeth per person, 50 percent higher than the global average of 1.67 teeth." said Dr. Ming Lun Hsu. "It would be a blessing for children, elderly, and the disabled if HOPE were to apply to the oral cavity."
Seeking Prevention instead of finding a cure
"One of the greatest things about HOPE is that it focuses primarily on the prevention of cavities, solving the problem from the root." Dr. Ming Lun Hsu specifically pointed out. "Nowadays, dentists have cutting edge techniques to cure dental caries. Yet, wouldn’t it be better if cavities were prevented from the very beginning?" The question stands to be one of the main concerns of the project.
The FDI, World Dental Federation, has promoted two methods of preventing tooth decay, including brushing one’s teeth and applying fluoride. “And now your team came up with another brilliant idea. Tackling the problem of tooth decay from the genetic level is something that I have never thought of.” Dr. Ming Lun Hsu approved with a smile.
Suggestions from Dr. Ming Lun Hsu
Since the microflora of children and seniors are quite different, Dr. Hsu suggested that we adjust the amount of M102 phage and probiotics for the two groups of people.
Furthermore, if HOPE can also be used to prevent root caries, it can ease the suffering for many elders with receding gums.
"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."  -Benjamin Franklin
