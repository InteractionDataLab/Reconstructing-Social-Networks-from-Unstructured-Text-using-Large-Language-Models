Promotion Booklets
In order to make our project easier to be understood, we decided to work on booklets both in English and in Chinese. These Booklets include the introduction of iGEM, NYMU, our team, and each part of our project.
The booklets are easy to carry around, enabling our team members to introduce our project to people anytime, anywhere. We enjoyed the experience of discussing our project with others and collecting advice from the public.
If interested, you are more than welcome to come to our poster and flip through our booklets.
