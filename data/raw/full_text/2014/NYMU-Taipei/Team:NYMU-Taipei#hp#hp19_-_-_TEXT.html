Article for Scientific American Taiwan
We were honored to have a discussion with the editor of chief of Scientific American Taiwan after a speech about synthetic biology in Tainan. During the discussion, editor of chief Li, Chia-Wei invited us to write an article for Scientific American Taiwan. It is one of the most popular magazines among high school students, especially for those who are interested in the latest technologies.
Besides introducing iGEM and HOPE, we wrote about our lab life. Looking back at all these interesting incidents that made everyone laugh hard, it is no wonder that we have become more like great friends than teammates. We had spent countless nights together in our lab and overcame numerous impediments. All of these will become precious memories that we will cherish for the rest of our lives.
