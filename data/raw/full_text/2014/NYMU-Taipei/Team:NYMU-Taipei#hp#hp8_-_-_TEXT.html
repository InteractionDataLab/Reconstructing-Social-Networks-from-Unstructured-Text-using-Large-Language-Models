Speeches in Taipei American School and China Medical University
Being one of the first teams in Asia to participate in iGEM, our professor is often invited to other schools to give speeches on iGEM and synthetic biology. Recently, other universities in Taiwan are getting interested in starting up new iGEM teams.
This year, we’ve visited Taipei American School and China Medical University. Taipei American School had collaborated with NYMU-Taipei in 2013, and founded its own high school iGEM team in 2014. They also did an excellent job in the high school competition. As for China Medical University, they are really interested in establishing their iGEM team. If they decide to form a team, then it would be the fifth iGEM team of Taiwan after NYMU, NTU, NCTU and TCU!
