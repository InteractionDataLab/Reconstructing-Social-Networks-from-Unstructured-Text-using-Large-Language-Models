About National Yang Ming University
Founded in 1974, National Yang-Ming University, formerly known as National Yang-Ming College of Medicine, has been adhering to the school motto of "benevolent mind and art, putting knowledge into practice" while training excellent humane doctors to provide service by solving medical problems in remote and rural areas.
In order to cultivate a new generation of professional medical talents, we began to expand our disciplines into biomedicine. In 1994, we were promoted to "National Yang-Ming University" and became the first medicine-oriented comprehensive university in Taiwan. As time went on, we established the School of Medical Technology and Engineering, the School of Life Sciences, the Center for General Studies, and the School of Nursing. Finally, we were permitted to establish a School of Dentistry in 2000 and also became a research university focusing on medicine and biotechnology.
Meaning of NYMU logo
White symbolizes the "holiness" of medical work. The plum flower blossom represents the determination required in medical work. It is also our national flower and painted in orange represents "light". The Caduceus made up of a staff with two snakes and two wings is a general symbol for "medicine," and is painted in sky blue symbolizing "loyalty". The gold color here represents the light of the doctor, rendering our school badge "shiny and magnificent". The orange and sky blue are the best matches in chromatics.
