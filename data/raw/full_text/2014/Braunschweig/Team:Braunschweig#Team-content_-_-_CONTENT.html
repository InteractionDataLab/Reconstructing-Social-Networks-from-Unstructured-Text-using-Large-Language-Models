                        Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
                        As a research fellow at the institute of biochemistry, biotechnology and bioinformatics I am usually in charge of research projects in the field of antibody selection. The work and mentoring for this years iGEM team is an interesting diversion from the daily routine in the lab. It´s a lot of fun to work out an ambitious project with highly motivated students and help them with words and deeds in the lab. Particularly the combination of students from all semesters renders the work especially interesting.

Why I take part in the iGEM competition:

In contrast to the routine I am used to in the course of my curriculum where I am mostly exposed to established experiments with forseeable results, iGEM offers the possibility to plan and carry out an own research project with a team –including all the accompaniments and imponderabilities. Thus, by being part of this year’s iGEM team, I expect to get a taste of the thrill hopefully awaiting me in my future work life.

Why I take part in the iGEM competition:

Synthetic biology is a fascinating field which has intrigued me for a long time and which I am considering as a possible future occupation. Furthermore, iGEM offers great opportunities into broaden my horizon beyond factual academic learning and to get to know other students with whom I can share my ideas and interest in biology and biotechnology.

Why I take part in the iGEM competition:

Apart from the various experiences you can gain in the field of project planning and applied science, I am especially looking forward to meeting iGEM teams and their projects from all over the world at the Giant Jamboree. What impresses me most about iGEM is to see that nearly every problem can be solved with the help of synthetic biology.

Why I take part in the iGEM competition:

Although the daily routine of academic studies facilitates some practical experiences as a student I am bound to the strictly arranged practicals. Under the conditions of the iGEM competition I hope to gain more practical knowledge which exceeds the “standard university knowledge” and which is distinctly closer to actual research. Furthermore I´m excited to work with ambitious colleagues and realize an entire project in all its facets (development, funding, conversion and presentation) and discuss and exchange about all that with students from around the world.

Why I take part in the iGEM competition:
At first I was really skeptical about the iGEM program because as a first semester there are so many new things to learn and to think about. However I decided to learn more about iGEM and on our first briefing I was so impressed about the engagement and courage of the members of last year´s team that I decided to join. Furthermore, there was also another aspect which guided me to the iGEM-Team. It was the idea of being creative, meeting new people and learning about synthetic biology all at once.

iGEM offers me the opportunity to test and expand my knowledge and experiences in bioscience. Therefore, I look forward to working on a self-organized research project with other motivated students parallel to studies. The cooperation in a team to work out a suitable project, the work in the wet lab and finally the presentation of our results allows a realistic look into the daily routine of scientific research.

Why I take part in the iGEM competition:

This competition provides the opportunity to develop an own idea from the very beginning in a young, diverse team. One has to come up with a finance plan, the implementation and finally the presentation. I think that we’ll have a lot of fun working on our project and especially on exchanging experiences with other teams.

Last year, I already participated in the iGEM competition and I had so much fun. Working in a self-organized team having other motivated students with innovative ideas, leads to many intense discussions. However, one of  the greatest springs of joy in teamwork like this and the reason for participating again is the time we spend together laughing.

Why I take part in the iGEM competition:

Having been on exchange to the University of Waterloo, I learned how important it is to have own ideas and to talk about the realization of those. Hence, I believe the IGEM competition gives us science students not only the opportunity to do so, but moreover allows us to get in contact with other people who are on the same page. By being part of an IGEM team I hope that I’ll gain some knowledge, get to know other science junkies and make some amazing experiences.

An important part of the iGEM competition is the cooperation between the teams. In order to get in contact with other iGEM Teams from Germany, we joined the iGEM meet-ups in<B> Munich</B> and <B>Aachen</B>. We numerously represented the iGEM Team Braunschweig at both events and drew attention to our this year’s project. We used these opportunities to give presentations and obtained encouraging feedback and helpful ideas during the follow-up discussions. At the Munich meet-up we made contact with the iGEM teams from Aachen and Hanover, followed by some nice barbecue evenings with <B>Team Hanover</B>. We also met a few iGEMers from Aachen at the “Maker Faire” in Hanover and spent the day together. <B>Team Aachen</B> provided us with a self-engineered methane sensor which we would later put to good use in our experiments. Such collaborations were strengthened at the second meet-up which was held in Aachen in September. However, we did not only get in contact with teams nearby, but also with teams overseas. We had a skype video chat with the iGEM <B>Team Waterloo</B> and discussed our projects, and exchanged our experiences concerning the competition.</P><P>The <B>iGEM Team from Virginia </B>created a survey about synthetic biology which was also to be conducted by teams from other parts of the world. Therefore, we translated the survey into German and conducted it at our university’s open house. The survey dealt with the public awareness towards and acceptance of synthetic biology and the aim was to get an impression of how people from all ages, origins and professions think about this. We do not know the results yet, but we still hope we could make a contribution for this survey to become more representative with regard to the control sample.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="templatemo-line-header"><DIV class="text-center"><H4 align="center">Our Supporters</H4></DIV></DIV><DIV class="templatemo-footer"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row"><DIV class="text-center"><A class="btn" href="#">Back To Top</A><DIV class="footer_bottom_content">Copyright © 2014 iGEM Team Braunschweig<A href="mailto:igem.braunschweig@gmail.com">Contact us</A></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
