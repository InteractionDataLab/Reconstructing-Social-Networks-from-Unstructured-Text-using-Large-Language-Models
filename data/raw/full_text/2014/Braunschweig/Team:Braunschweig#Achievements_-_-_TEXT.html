Achievements
Apart from our results with E. cowli there are certain other things we achieved during our work for this year’s competition, we would like to share with you as well as the whole iGEM community. By doing so, we live up to one of the basic ideas behind iGEM - contributing BioBricks to the large collection called the Registry of Standard Biological Parts so that other teams can make use of them in the future.
As we would love to take home a little souvenir from the Giant Jamboree we also list here how we attempted to meet the medal requirements. These are criteria defining how award decisions are made in the competition, and we did our best to go for gold!
Parts
The use of biological parts, or BioBricks, is one of the fundaments of iGEM. Listed here are the parts we used for our project and the ones we improved or added to the Registry.
Medal Requirements
To obtain an award teams have to meet certain medal requirements defining a basis for award decisions. Here you can find these criteria and how we attempted to do justice to them.
