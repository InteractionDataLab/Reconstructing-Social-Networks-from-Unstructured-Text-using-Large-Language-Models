Acknowledgement
We owe our progress and attainments to people and institutes that have kindly offered their help to us, without whom we would not have finished our project.
We sincerely appreciate Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, from which we gained much support.
We also attribute out success in finishing the project to the financial support from School of Life Sciences of Sun Yan-sen University and Yat-sen School of Sun Yat-sen University.
Our instructor, Prof. Jianhua Yang, gave us much precious advice on improving our software, for whom we must make a grateful acknowledgement. We thank Yan Zhang, Jian Ren, Xionglei He for offering instructions to us. In addition, we thank our advisors, Lingling Zheng and Junjiu Huang, who gave us suggestions on software design and experiment design respectively.
We also thank Prof. Yongjun Lu, who kindly offered us with financial support and laboratory for our wetlab experiment.
The places where we worked on our project were kindly offered by Microsoft Student Technology Club, Apple Club and IBM Club of Sun Yat-sen University. The comfortable working environment has greatly promoted our progress in the project.
