Acknowledgement
We owe our progression and attainments to people and institutes that have kindly offered their help to us, without whom we would not have finished our project.
We sincerely appreciate Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, from which we gained much support.
We also attribute out success in finishing the project to the financial support from School of Life Sciences of Sun Yan-sen University and Yat-sen School of Sun Yat-sen University.
Our instructor, Prof. Jianhua Yang, gave us much precious advice on improving our software, without whom we could not finish our project. Thus, we must make a grateful acknowledgement for him. We also thank Yan Zhang, Jian Ren, Xionglei He for providing instruction to us. In addition, we thank our advisors, Lingling Zheng and Junjiu Huang, who gave us suggestions on software design and experiment design respectively.
We also thank Prof. Yongjun Lu, who kindly offered us with financial support and laboratory for our wet-lab experiment.
We'd like to thank Junzhi Wen for his technical support on TEDx. With his help we can smoothly accomplish our Human Practice.
The place we work on our project was kindly offered by Microsoft Student Technology Club of Sun Yat-sen University. The comfortable working environment has greatly promoted our progress in the project.
