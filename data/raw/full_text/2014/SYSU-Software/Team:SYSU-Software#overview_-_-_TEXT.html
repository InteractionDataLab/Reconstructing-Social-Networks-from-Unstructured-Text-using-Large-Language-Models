Overview
Softwares used for genetic circuit designs in synthetic biology (what we called “Synthetic Biology Operating System”, SBOS) can be divided into three catogaries: SBOS 1.0, SBOS 2.0 and SBOS 3.0.
SBOS 1.0 is for designs starting from parts to modules. Based on a framework from which users choose the suitable promoters, RBS (ribosome binding sites), coding sequences and terminators to construct a module so called ”biobrick”. For SBOS 2.0, once users specify logic relationships between modules (Biobricks) to construct a system, SBOS 2.0 (such as CAST created by our team SYSU-Software last year) helps to characterize the behaviour of the system.
However, SBOS 2.0 hardly tackle tow major problems. One is that SBOS 2.0 need much mannual work. Users have to “link” the chosen parts and modules in order to make a system, making users confused about what hundreds of thousands of parts and mudules are for. SBOS 2.0 has a second problem that is great enough to make its applications limited to simple designs. The problem is that user-designs do not mean usable. Due to wide range of imcompatiblities among parts and modules, the designed system may not run well.
So, SBOS 3.0 can help you! Based on principles of design frameworks, this software provides you with smarter, more automatic designs. With standardized biobricks and databases, the software automatically joins parts and modules and consequently a system come into being. That is, after you define the inputs, outputs and logic between them, our software offers you with different solutions (that is, different mechanisms for the same effect) , the performance of each can be visible via a rader map. The built-in databases are abstracted from papers of considerable values of reference.
It is far from finishing a design when a system comes out. Our software can mathematically simulate three major characteristics that describe the behaviour of the system: static performance, dynamic performance and expression efficiency, which might help you determine the performance of your designed system.
