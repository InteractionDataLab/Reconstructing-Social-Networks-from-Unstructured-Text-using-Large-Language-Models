Collaboration
We cooperated with SYSU-China and developed an online blast software -- Biobrick Blast Online (Figure 1). SUSTC-Shenzhen and NTU_Taida tried the software and pointed out the bugs in the software. We greatly appreciate their feedbacks on BBO!

USTC-China held the iGEM Software Track Meetup in August. We shared our ideas on software design with other iGEM software teams from China. Judges from USTC gave us precious advice on how we could improve our work and presentation (Fig. 2).

One of our team leaders, Peng Nie, gave a brief presentation titled “Develop professional software, and how to professionally develop a software” (Figure 3), talking about his past experiences in SYSU-Software team and his ideas on software designs.
