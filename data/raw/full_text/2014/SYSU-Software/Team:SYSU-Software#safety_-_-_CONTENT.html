Concerns about biosafety arises as we carried out the experiments. In this wiki page, we hope to demonstrate our responsibilities for biosafety, and what we have done already to ensure that we base our wetlab on biosafety rules, in the following.

Our experiments aimed at verifying how well our algorithms can reflect the reality of real experimental results. Meanwhile, we should test the performance and safety of these designed circuits. So we had the genetic circuits designed by FLAME tested, and obtained experimental results. Then we compared the algorithmic simulation with experimental results. </P><P>Some of the genetic circuits have been provided in previous journal papers, so these well-known genetic circuits are relatively safe. In addition, we adopt the known genetic circuits as frameworks for further circuit design by users. FLAME can design new circuits with ordinary parts such as GFP, LacI, AraC, TetR and so on. These parts have been adopted by synthetic biologists as well as iGEM teams in experiments for years, which indicates that there are little safety concerns. </P></DIV><DIV class="ui piled segment" style="position: relative;text-align: center;	margin: 0px auto;width: 850px; font-size: 20px;"><H2 style="text-align: center;">Laboratory Safety</H2><P>Our team work in Level 1 labs and use Risk Group 1 organisms; that is, as mentioned above, we use <SPAN style="font-style:italic;">Escherichia coli</SPAN> K-12 as model species. So, for the safety of experimenters’ sake, we did our experiments in accordance with the laboratory safety rules of Sun Yat-sen University.

In addition, everyone participating in the wet-lab must be trained in safety rules and experimental skills. During the process, we utilized <SPAN style="font-style:italic;">E. coli</SPAN> as our model species which is harmless to both experimenters and the environment. When finishing the experiments, we cleaned the lab, appropriately sterilized the equipment with high temperature, carefully packed the wastes for safety disposal by company before discarding (Figure 2, right), and washed our hands. 	Measures mentioned above (and of course formulated by safety rules of biology labs in SYSU) are crucial to our sticking to biosafety.

Moreover, appropriate disposal of wastes produced in the experiments ensures that our wetlab practice produced little waste. Some detailed demonstrations of the methods that we adopted to dispose of wastes have already been provided in the “Researcher safety” section. </P><P>Furthermore, researchers’ habits make a difference to biosafety around the labs. We paid much attention to this, and safety training was carried out. For instance, opening the door with used gloves on is severely prohibited, to make sure that harmful substance or organisms (if exist) would not spread in public places.</P><P>In sum, our experiments made use of harmless parts, produced little harmful wastes which afterwards are appropriately disposed of, and required strict training to cultivate good habits in labs. All of these are our practices for the goods of public and environmental safety in labs.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
