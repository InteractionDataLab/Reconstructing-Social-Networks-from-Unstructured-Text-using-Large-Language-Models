Introduction
Biobrick Blast Online
Biobrick Blast Online, short for BBO, is an online Biobrick alignment and search toolkit made by SYSU-Software and SYSU-China.       If you still have trouble or feel monotonous when you want to find some Biobricks containing or related to the known sequence       which is needed, you should try our software.

It is easy and convenient for everyone to use it. Enter your sequence or import the sequence from your file,       and then choose the E-Value, database and output format as you like,       you will soon get all Biobricks that contain or are related to the sequence,       as well as the overall information on those Biobricks. What’s more, our software is nonprofit and practical.       Now, move on and have a try!
