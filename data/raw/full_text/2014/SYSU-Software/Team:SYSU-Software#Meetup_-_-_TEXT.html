Meetup with SKLBC IGEM high school team
On 1st of June, 2014, we are invited to attend a meetup organized by SKLBC high school team, in order to discuss ideas about iGEM projects. In the next few weeks, the IGEM high school team would embrace their first presentation under the world’s attention. At first, two girls form the high school team introduced to us how they think about their software as a social medium to collaborate people’s efforts in finding biobricks. With increasing public engagement in Wechat, a widely-used smartphone app through China, they thought that maybe they could grasp that opportunities and provided the services of presenting biobricks to the users. More importantly, the idea of making full use of social media distinct them from other teams that concentrate more attention on disciplinary knowledge but pale due to a shortage of more advanced knowledge. Then, a boy who was mainly in charge of the app gave a speech about how he developed that app. We surprisingly found that despite lack of experience, he displayed app skill of high level and uttered his determination for better.
In the end, we share our stories in IGEM and found how much we have grown with the help of other IGEMers. Thanks to the platform-IGEM, we strives for better in the years to come.

Meetup with USTC-Software iGEM team
From Aug.14th to Aug.17th, 4 members of our team went to Hefei, China and take part in the iGem software track meet up arranged by USTC. In these 4 days, we not only had parties with students from different schools, but also went mount climbing with those guys which is super exciting. Yet the most crucial part and the main purpose of our coming to Hefei is of course the idea exchanging section during this meet up. USTC set up 2 rounds of presentation for all of us, one in Mandarin and the other in English. In that way, we could show our work to other members, inspire them, give them ideas of improvement, and practice our oral English at the same time.
Moreover, judges from USTC also gave us precious advises about how we could make our work and presentation better and be more competent to the final prize.
Members of SYSU finished the task smoothly. We articulated our work and ideas and our team leader Nie Peng also shared his experience with the audience about how to make iGem software professionally, which brought the whole meet up to an end perfectly.
