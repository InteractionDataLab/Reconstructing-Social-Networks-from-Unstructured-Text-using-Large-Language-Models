Characterization of BBa_K747096
During DNA assembly, we found that this promoter was activated in Escherichia coli. Then we decided to characterize this promoter activity by comparing with constitutive promoter (BBa_J23101) using GFP (BBa_E0040) (Figure 1).
As seen in Figure 1, this promoter shows weaker activity than BBa_J23101.

In order to calculate RPU (relative promoter unit [1]), we performed real-time measurement of GFP fluorescence (Figure 2). We measured activity of GFP and OD600, which are necessary for calculation of RPU.

We calculated RPU(Relative Promoter Unit) of BBa_K747096 from the Fig. 2 using the equation (1).

This equation can be used only when Fluorescence per cell is in steady state. In this experiment, this condition was fulfilled as shown in Table1.

From Table1, we can get RPU of BBa_K747096:
RPU = 5.8
