Our activities involved in iGEM were all conducted by undergraduates alone!!
All the team members had a lot of brainstorming, investigations and discussions in order to select project carefully. In addition, we conducted the experiments and FINALLY got the results.
We also designed and composed all the publishing tools, and of course, polished all scripts and presentation by ourselves. We did fund-raising and public relations.
