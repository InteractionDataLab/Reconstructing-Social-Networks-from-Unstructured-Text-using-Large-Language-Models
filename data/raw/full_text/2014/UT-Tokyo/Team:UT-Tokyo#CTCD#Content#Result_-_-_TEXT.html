Our aim was to make a construct like below.(Fig.1)
<img src="
" class = "figure" />
<legend>Fig. 1</legend>
miRNA142-5p sequence is CAUAAAGUAGAAAGCACUACU .
miRNA142-3p sequence is UGUAGUGUUUCCUACUUUAUGGA.
The target sequence is complementary to the miRNA142-5p and miRNA142-3p sequence.
miRNA142-5p binding site is AGTAGTGCTTTCTACTTTATG.
miRNA142-3p binding site is TCCATAAAGTAGGAAACACTACA.
We constructed miRNA-binding sites by annealing the two oligos shown below (BBa_K1461100, BBa_K1461101).
5’-GCGGAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGAGCATAAAGTAGAAAGCACTACTTACTAGTAGCGGCCGCTGCAGGCG-3’
5’-CGCCTGCAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTAAGTAGTGCTTTCTACTTTATGCTCTAGAAGCGGCCGCGAATTCCGC-3’
When we made miRNA-binding site connected tandemly, we couldn’t use PCR or gel extraction because they contained repeats and short sequences . So we had to anneal two oligos and insert in the plasmid.(Fig.2)

This method can be used for other miRNA-binding sites or other parts not suitable for PCR or gel extraction .
Constructs we planed to use in this experiment were already made apart from EGP-2 promoter, and sequences were confirmed (BBa_K1461306, BBa_K1461307, BBa_K1461308, BBa_K1461309, BBa_K1461310, BBa_K1461311). But cloning of EGP-2 was not successful.
So we have to clone EGP-2 promoter, make the construct,and perform reporter assay before our presentation.
