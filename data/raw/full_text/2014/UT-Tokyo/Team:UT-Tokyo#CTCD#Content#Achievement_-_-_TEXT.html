Criteria for Bronze Prize
1.Team registration.
2.Complete Judging form.
3.Team Wiki.
4.Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
5.The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. Please see the iGEM 2011 Imperial College Acknowledgements page for an example.
6.Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. Please see theRegistry help page on adding new parts. A new application and/or outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part also counts. Please see the Registry help page on how to document your contributions. To fulfill this criteria, you will also need to submit the part with its original part name to the Registry, following the submission guidelines.
We meet these criterias, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. We plan to meet 4 in Jamboree.
Criteria for Silver Prize
1. Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
We meet this criteria with BBa_K1461225, BBa_1461226. See Counter_Result.<a href=" https://2014.igem.org/Team:UT-Tokyo/Counter/Project?page=Result-block " target="_blank">link</a>
2.Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
We meet this criteria with BBa_K1461225, BBa_1461226. See Counter_Result. See the parts registry.<a href=" http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1461225 " target="_blank">link</a>
3.Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
We meet this criteria. <p>4. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.
We discussed ethics on our project. See Policy and Practice_Ethics.<a href=" https://2014.igem.org/Team:UT-Tokyo/Counter/Project?page=Humanpractice-block&contents=Humanpractice-1 " target="_blank">link</a>
Criteria for Gold Prize
1. Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part.
We characterized BBa_K747096. See CTCD_Modeling.<a href=" https://2014.igem.org/Team:UT-Tokyo/CTCD/Content?page=Modeling-block " target="_blank">link</a>
2. Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
We helped Nagahama team with modeling. See Policy and Practice_Human Practice.<a href=" https://2014.igem.org/Team:UT-Tokyo/Counter/Project?page=Humanpractice-block&contents=Humanpractice-1 " target="_blank">link</a>
3. iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities.
We discussed ethics on our project. See Policy and Practice_Ethics.<a href=" https://2014.igem.org/Team:UT-Tokyo/Counter/Project?page=Humanpractice-block&contents=Humanpractice-1 " target="_blank">link</a>
In addition to this, our achievement is written in the judging form submitted to the iGEM Headquarter.
