</DD></DL><P>IDEA #1
</P><P>PAMPS are referred to as pathogen associated molecular patterns, they're basically parts of bacteria that are recognized by our immune system as foreign. I've followed up and researched a bit more about this idea and propose that we could possibly: 
</P><P>Introduce a number of genes into a particular cell line, since each of our cells have specific proteins called caspases that are cleaved upon detecting a bacterial product (e.g Flagellin from bacteria); these caspases normally cause a number of processes that leads to cell death but ONLY upon sensing bacterial products, they become active. However, if we could somehow get caspases to recognize a particular protein (e.g green florescent protein - GFP) into our introduced samples and cleave it so that GFP becomes active, then we've developed a cool biological sensor that can detect particular bacterial products. Of course, similarly we'd have to make sure that we prevent cell death from occurring (this could be through the introduction of inhibitors of effector caspases e.g Caspase 3 that are the actual executors of cell death.)
</P><P>Below I've attached a review on caspases

</P><P>
I'm happy too explain to anyone about caspases and how this system works - perhaps when we come to initial ideas and anyone is interested, I can draw a diagram and then just explain it further - Waqar.

</DD></DL><P>Idea #1
</P><P>I proposed that we used optogenetics to control movement/behavior of vertebrate models such as Xenopus, however I think this approach would be particularly difficult and the consensus on this is that its a hard system to implement in practice. In particular, i feel that it doesn't have any far reaching impacts in terms of trying to then move forward (in respect to synthetic biology and contribution of parts etc) and has already extensively been tried and tested on say, mice. I think the start-up kits are around £2000 also. If anyone wants to expand on this and find out more, feel free to add anything below what I've written. - Waq. 
</P><P>In addition, after researching what the washington team did - i noted that their main problem was in the control of expression levels, which would be expected in such a system due to the fine level of control in respect to light that is required. 
</P><P>Reviews on this system, Karl Deisseroth is the pioneer of this system for behavioral manipulation by using light.

</P><P>Biological feasibility (Waqar) 
</P><P>Detecting vitamin deficiencies and addressing them
</P><P>did literature searches and couldn't really find any system that people have used/engineered in which vitamins are <B>detected</B> by bacteria - potentially have to find out the mechanisms in which the human body detects and deals with vitamin deficiencies; (for iron - transferrin synthesis is controlled) 
</P><PRE>Found previous Igem competitions where people have engineered bacteria to produce certain vitamins, such as vitamin B9 by caltech <A href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:Caltech/2008/Project/Vitamins" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://openwetware.org/wiki/IGEM:Caltech/2008/Project/Vitamins</A></PRE><P>others: <A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Johns_Hopkins" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://2011.igem.org/Team:Johns_Hopkins</A></P><P>--
</P><P>I came up with an idea in which we could potentially develop bacteria that can remove/uptake cholesterol - a particular type of bacteria called Lactobacillus (present in our gut as microbiota) is able too remove cholestorol - 
</P><PRE>Liong MT, Shah NP. Acid and bile tolerance and the cholesterol removal ability of Lactobacilli strains. J. Dairy. Sci. 88, 55–66 (2005).

</P><P><B>Collagen producing bacteria</B>

Using bacteria to breakdown blockage in blood vessels<B> - how about producing bacteria that express an anatagonist of PDGF and VEGF - these are growth factors that promote angiogenesis, which is the growth of new blood vessels from existing ones &gt; which happens a lot in cancer and is overactive (as cancers need a massive blood supply to become full scale tumors) </B></P><P>some teams have:
</P><P><A href="https://2013hs.igem.org/Team:Jefferson_VA_SciCOS" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://2013hs.igem.org/Team:Jefferson_VA_SciCOS</A> - designed a system to promote angiogenesis under hypoxic (low oxygen) conditions 
</P><P><A href="https://2011.igem.org/Team:Virginia" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://2011.igem.org/Team:Virginia</A> - developed a system where angiogenesis is induced in wound sites (we could take their chassis/make up what they did to test the efficiency of our system)?
</P><P>

Cancer treatment - colon cancer(CA marker)
Fusion protein to signal the expression of perforin (e coli as NKC)<B> - a pretty cool idea, basically engineer killer bacteria that can recognize and kill cancer cells (particular markers characterize different types of cancer e.g prostate specific antigen for prostate cancers &gt; could engineer a bacteria that detects PSA and then is activated/induced to kill prostate cancer cells?)</B></P><P>Bacteria to target the larvae
</P><P>To separate Tamoxifen (possibly a chiral drug) by uptake the drugs into modified E Coli and bind it to the receptor inside the bacteria.
