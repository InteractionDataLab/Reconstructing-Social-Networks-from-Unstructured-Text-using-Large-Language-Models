How do I take this further?
So we have done all this modelling, natural questions now to ask would be: how can I take this further? How is this useful to me?
As you can see, much of modelling is similar to the world of science, in that someone has laid groundwork in a particular area to allow for potential expansion. At virtually every point, we began with the literature and then adapted the already existing model to include features that we required. We hope that by taking things in iGEM further by introducing time delay systems and a more rigourous way of using stochastic modelling, we have laid the foundations for teams to gain a better insight into their systems.
But in case you are struggling for ideas on how to expand, here are a few ways in which to proceed:
Tecan data analysis: the MATLAB file that we created allows for efficient analysis of results obtained from a tecan plate reader.
DE Solvers: to help teams explore more mathematically sound models that reflect reality more closely, we have included our own MATLAB solvers available for use against any system.
References: we have tried our best to provide references illustrating where we obtained information from, this will prove very helpful to future teams by providing a single source which has collated all the sources thereby making navigation through the realms of the literature easier.
