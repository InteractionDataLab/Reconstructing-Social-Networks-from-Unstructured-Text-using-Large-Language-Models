siRNA
This is the functional element of our replicon and shows a  potential area for RNA experimentation. This sequence was   specifically designed using RNA fold and investigating the minimum   free energy bond formation, in order to form a secondary structure   in the positive sense that would not include a length of double   stranded RNA longer than 16 bases and hence would not be   recognised by Dicer and our replicon would remain intact for further   replication. However, in the negative sense the secondary structure   will form a hairpin recognised by Dicer which will result in cleavage   and release of the siRNA from the RNA strand allowing it to bind in a   complimentary fashion to the 3’UTR of DPP-IV mRNA and cause RNA   silencing hence reducing the amount of DPP-IV protein present in the   cell.  We used siRNA sequences from various papers to design this   hairpin.
