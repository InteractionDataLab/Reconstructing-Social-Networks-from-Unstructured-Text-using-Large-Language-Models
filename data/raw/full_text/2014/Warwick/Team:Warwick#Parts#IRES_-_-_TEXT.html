IRES
This  acts as an initiation for eukaryotic   ribosomes and begins translation of the   following protein sequence. We   compared two different IRESs: the   classical EMCV IRES used in many papers,which has been shown to be compatible   with replicons and the NKRF IRES derived from the 3’UTR of  the mammalian NF-kappaB repressing   factor, which we also chose to test because during   investigation regarding the efficacy and   strength of the EMCV IRES, the NKRF derived   IRES was shown to be 30-fold more   efficient however had never been previously used in Huh7.
