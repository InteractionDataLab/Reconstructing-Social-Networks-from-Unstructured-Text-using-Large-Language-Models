RdRp
This is a polymerase derived from Hepatitis C Virus Strain  1b isolate Con1 which catalyses the replication of RNA from an RNA template, reffered to as NS5B in   the contact of the HCV genome. Heterelogous expression of NS5B has been achieved in insect and   bacterial hosts, with RNA-dependent RNA synthesis initiated de novo (Behrens et al., 1996; Lohmann   et al., 1997). Structural studies indicate the hydrophobic C-terminal 21 amino acid residues cause   insertion into the membrane with other intracellular protein-protein interactions implicated (Moradpour   et al., 2004) making the final 63 bases essential for HCV RNA replication in eukaryotic cells   (Moradpour et al., 2004). In prokaryotic cells the final 21 amino acids are expendable. RdRp initiates   viral RNA synthesis with nucleotidyl transfer activity found within palm motifs A and C, with several   amino acid residues implicated in nucleotide triphosphate contact (Bressanelli et al., 2002). NS5B   activity has been demonstrated ''in vitro'', with synthesis of full length HCV RNA (Lohmann et al.,   1997; Ferrari et al., 1999). 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of the HCV genome contains   ordered RNA structures, which are evolutionary conserved and contain crucial cis-acting elements for   viral RNA replication. 150 nt in the 3’ termini of HCV RNA contains elements which are essential for   RdRp binding and replication of viral RNA (Cheng et al., 1999; Yi and Lemon, 2003).
