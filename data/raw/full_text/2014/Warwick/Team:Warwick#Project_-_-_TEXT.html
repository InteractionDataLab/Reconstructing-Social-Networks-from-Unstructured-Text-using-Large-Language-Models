WELCOME TO RNA WORLD
Welcome to the biological world which we have spent an entire summer creating and perfecting. We are introducing RNA to synthetic biology in a big way by directly contributing a number of key parts to iGEM.  We have taken a risk, we have been told our project is unrealistic and should be scrapped, that a group of undergraduates are crazy for even thinking about doing something so complicated. At times, we doubted ourselves- there have been good times and bad times.  Spurred on by a desire to make a difference to synthetic biology and to the world in which we live, we pressed forward - a new team to iGEM, not seasoned veterans. We take chances and risks to make a difference - whether success comes our way or failure, we embrace the moment, cherishing it. We hope that the synthetic biology community will appreciate our efforts, as RNA usage and popularity surges. DNA best serves as a template for information storage whereas RNA is multi-functional, catalytic and dynamic. Welcome to our world - the RNA world!
