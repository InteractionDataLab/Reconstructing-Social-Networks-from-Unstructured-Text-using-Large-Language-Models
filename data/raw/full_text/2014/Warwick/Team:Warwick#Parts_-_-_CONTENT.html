The parts labelled 'favourite' are our best parts. </P><DIV id="pop1" class="popbox"><H2>5' RNA Promoter</H2><P>This is derived from the 5' UTR of the HCV virus strain 1b isolate Con1. It contains the reverse complement of the RdRp initiation sequence. The secondary structure of this sequence acts as a binding site and initiates replication of the minus strand by RdRp. It also includes the first 16 amino acids of the first gene of HCV as this has been shown to increase the efficacy of binding of the RdRp to the 5' promoter. We define an RNA promoter as a sequence located at the 3' end of the transcript, consisting of a RdRp initiation sequence and a ribozyme that cleaves after the initiation sequence without leaving any scar. We foresee that such regulatory elements will allow constructing novel post-transcriptional circuits by adding operator sites in the promoters. Such operator sites could be for instance the MS2 hairpin or any other RNA sequence known to bind to a regulator. This is the RNA equivalent to a transcription factor.</P></DIV><DIV id="pop2" class="popbox"><H2>IRES</H2><P>This

acts as an initiation for eukaryotic 

ribosomes and begins translation of the 

following protein sequence. We 

compared two different IRESs: the 

classical EMCV IRES used in many papers in our target cells,which has been shown to be compatible 

with replicons and the NKRF IRES derived from the 3’UTR of

the mammalian NF-kappaB repressing 

factor. We chose to test it also because during 

investigation regarding the efficacy and 

strength of the EMCV IRES, the NKRF derived 

IRES was shown to be 30-fold more 

efficient; however, it had never been previously used in Huh7.</P></DIV><DIV id="pop3" class="popbox"><H2>MS2 Box</H2><P>The MS2 box acts as a binding 

site for the MS2 coat protein (formed 

downstream in the replicon), which 

represses translation, hence preventing 

exponential growth of the replicon. This &quot;copy number control&quot; also allows a switching off of the RdRp once a steady state is reached, which minimizes the possible interferences between RdRp and the ribosome.</P></DIV><DIV id="pop4" class="popbox"><H2>Neomycin Resistance</H2><P>This was included in order to select 

for the cells which had been 

successfully transfected with the 

replicon. This is commonly used in 

human cell studies and allows survival 

of eukaryotic cells in the prescence of 

geneticin.</P></DIV><DIV id="pop5" class="popbox"><H2>Aptazyme</H2><P>This is an RNA enzyme which self-

cleaves in the presence of 

theophylline. Theophylline is not 

endogenous to mammalian cells, 

hence acts as a selective “off-switch” 

in an instance such as, Hepatitis C 

infection or tumour formation which 

is exacerbated by lack of DPP-IV.</P></DIV><DIV id="pop6" class="popbox"><H2>siRNA</H2><P>This is the functional element of our replicon and shows a

potential area for RNA experimentation. This sequence was 

specifically designed using RNA fold and investigating the minimum 

free energy bond formation, in order to form a secondary structure 

in the positive sense that would not include a length of double 

stranded RNA longer than 16 bases and hence would not be 

recognised by Dicer and our replicon would remain intact for further 

replication. However, in the negative sense the secondary structure 

will form a hairpin recognised by Dicer which will result in cleavage 

and release of the siRNA from the RNA strand allowing it to bind in a 

complimentary fashion to the 3’UTR of DPP-IV mRNA and cause RNA 

silencing hence reducing the amount of DPP-IV protein present in the 

cell.  We used siRNA sequences from various papers to design this 

hairpin.</P></DIV><DIV id="pop7" class="popbox"><H2>MS2 Coat Protein</H2><P>This coding sequence forms

a protein which binds to the MS2 box - a hairpin 

type structure, and represses translation of the 

replicon.</P></DIV><DIV id="pop8" class="popbox"><H2>P2A</H2><P>This is derived from the Porcine

Teschovirus-1 genome and cleaves with high 

efficiency and leaves no scar following the 

formation of a polyprotein MS2 coat protein, 

P2A and RdRp. This is required as the HCV 

genome has one open reading frame 

from which one long polyprotein is produced. 

RdRp is the final protein in this polygenic 

mRNA and hence does not have a start codon, 

adding a start codon could be disastrous for 

the function of RdRp.</P></DIV><DIV id="pop9" class="popbox"><H2>RdRp</H2><P>This is a polymerase derived from Hepatitis C Virus Strain

1b isolate Con1 which catalyses the replication of RNA from an RNA template, reffered to as NS5B in 

the contact of the HCV genome. Heterelogous expression of NS5B has been achieved in insect and 

bacterial hosts, with RNA-dependent RNA synthesis initiated de novo (Behrens et al., 1996; Lohmann 

et al., 1997). Structural studies indicate the hydrophobic C-terminal 21 amino acid residues cause 

insertion into the membrane with other intracellular protein-protein interactions implicated (Moradpour 

et al., 2004) making the final 63 bases essential for HCV RNA replication in eukaryotic cells 

(Moradpour et al., 2004). In prokaryotic cells the final 21 amino acids are expendable. RdRp initiates 

viral RNA synthesis with nucleotidyl transfer activity found within palm motifs A and C, with several 

amino acid residues implicated in nucleotide triphosphate contact (Bressanelli et al., 2002). NS5B 

activity has been demonstrated ''in vitro'', with synthesis of full length HCV RNA (Lohmann et al., 

1997; Ferrari et al., 1999). 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of the HCV genome contains 

ordered RNA structures, which are evolutionary conserved and contain crucial cis-acting elements for 

viral RNA replication. 150 nt in the 3’ termini of HCV RNA contains elements which are essential for 

RdRp binding and replication of viral RNA (Cheng et al., 1999; Yi and Lemon, 2003).</P></DIV><DIV id="pop10" class="popbox"><H2>3' RNA Promoter</H2><P>Each unique RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) initiates de novo replication of a RNA strand by interacting with RdRP-specific RNA sequences, henceforth called RdRP/RNA promoters. The promoter is &quot;insulated&quot; by using a ribozyme on its 3' end that self-cleaves without leaving a scar (and, therefore, producing the right 3' end for RdRp initiation).  The RdRP chosen for our project is taken from the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and it recognizes a limited set of such initiation sequences. All of them possess a few common characteristics: an initiation cytidylate at the 3’ end, where the replication starts; and a stable secondary structure – single stranded tail and a stem of various length. For our project in addition to the indigenous to HCV RdRP promoters, we designed alternative RNA promoter sequences previously identified by Heinz et al. as templates for replication by the HCV RdRP. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><FOOTER><P>Created by: iGEM Warwick</P><P>Contact information: <A href="mailto:igem.warwick@gmail.com">
