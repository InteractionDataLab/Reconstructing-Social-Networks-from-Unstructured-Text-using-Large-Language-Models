P2A
This is derived from the Porcine  Teschovirus-1 genome and cleaves with high   efficiency and leaving no scar following the   formation of a polyprotein MS2 coat protein,   P2A and RdRp. This is required as the HCV   genome which has one open reading frame   from which one long polyprotein is produced.   RdRp is the final protein in this polygenic   mRNA and hence does not have a start codon,   adding a start codon could be disastrous for   the function of RdRp.
