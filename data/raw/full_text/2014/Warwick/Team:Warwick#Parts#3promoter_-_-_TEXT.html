5' Promoter
This is derived from the 5i UTR of the HCV virus strain 1b isolate Con1. The secondary structure of this sequence acts as a binding site and initiates replication of the system by RdRp. It also includes the first 16 amino acids of the first gene of HCV as this has been shown to increase the efficacy of binding of the RdRp to the 5' promoter.

3' Promoter
Each unique RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) initiates de novo replication of a RNA strand by interacting with RdRP-specific RNA sequences, henceforth called RdRP/RNA promoters. The RdRP chosen for our project is taken from the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and it recognizes a limited set of such sequences. All of them possess a few common characteristics: an initiation cytidylate at the 3’ end, where the replication starts; and a stable secondary structure – single stranded tail and a stem of various length. For our project in addition to the indigenous to HCV RdRP promoters, we designed alternative promoter sequences previously identified by Heinz et. Al. as templates for replication by the HCV RdRP. The list below illustrates all the 3' promoters we considered as part of our system.
