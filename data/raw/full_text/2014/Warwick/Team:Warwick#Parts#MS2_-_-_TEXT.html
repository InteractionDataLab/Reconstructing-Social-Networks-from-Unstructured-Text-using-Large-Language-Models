MS2 Box
The MS2 box acts as a binding   site for the MS2 coat protein, formed   downstream in the replicon, which   represses translation hence preventing   exponential growth of the replicon. Exploiting the MS2 box-protein binding relationship is known as MS2 tagging.

MS2 Coat Protein
This coding sequence forms  a protein which binds to the MS2 box, hairpin   type structure, and represses translation of the   replicon.
