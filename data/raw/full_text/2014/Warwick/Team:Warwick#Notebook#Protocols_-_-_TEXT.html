Protocols
As every biologist knows, protocols are key to being successful in the lab. Considering that we were the first team to deal with RNA systems, this meant that with regards to iGEM we were using protocols that other teams hadn't used. We thought that it would be beneficial to upload a nice booklet that we made, illustrating various protocols (listed below), for future teams to download, print and make use of in their labs. We hope it is as helpful to everyone else as it was to us!
If you would like to download our protocol booklet, it is available here .
