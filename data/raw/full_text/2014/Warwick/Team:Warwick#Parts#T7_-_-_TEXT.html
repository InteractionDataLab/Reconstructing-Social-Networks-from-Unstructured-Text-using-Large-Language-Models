T7 PROMOTER
The following part is a T7 promoter. This section of DNA code is responsible for initiation of transcription. Promoters are located near the transcription start sites of genes, on the same strand and upstream on the DNA (towards the 5' region of the sense strand). [1]

T7 TERMINATOR
The following part is a T7 terminator, the section of code responsible for marking the end of transcription. This sequence mediates transcriptional termination by providing signals in the newly synthesized mRNA that trigger processes which release the mRNA from the transcriptional complex. These processes include the direct interaction of the mRNA secondary structure with the complex and/or the indirect activities of recruited termination factors. Release of the transcriptional complex frees RNA polymerase and related transcriptional machinery to begin transcription of new mRNAs. [2]
