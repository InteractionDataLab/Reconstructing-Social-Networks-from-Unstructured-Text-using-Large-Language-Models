Social media
When we popularize the safety of synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance, we recognized it not enough to hold activities only, so we focus more on the social media like writing reports on internet. At the beginning, we connected with the school journal. And then as the scale became lager, many famous media came to report us like Guangzhou Daily. Especially the reports about our exhibition in science center, was spread on many well known websites like Tencent, Baidu and so on.
