Xihao Liao,the leader of our team, is in charge of team routines, such as, holding a meeting, arranging activities and keeping team collaborating efficiently. What he always does is to send messages to us, to remind us to get up and sleep early almost every day, when to have a meeting and so on. He enjoys his life and what he is doing. He loves sports and often arranges some sports exercise on Friday in order to relax ourselves.
Yaqin Du is also a former member of the iGEM team of 2013. Thus, we always benefit from her experiences, especially about gene knockout.Her motto: Rome was not built in a day.
Shanshan Qu, a small potato of our team,takes part in the experiment on her own responsibility. Does her best to contribute to the team.Although she joins in our team later than everyone else, she never gave up trying.
