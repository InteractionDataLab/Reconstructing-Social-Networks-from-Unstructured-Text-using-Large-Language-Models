Programmed polyketide synthesis
Polyketides, including macrolides, tetracyclines, anthracyclines, and other polyether compounds with anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, anti-cancer, immune suppression and other functions, are a large class of natural products produced by bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi or plants. For the heterologous expression of polyketide synthase, the main method of the technology is transferring full gene cluster into heterologous host strains.However, such method can’t synthetize various polyketides by the same polyketide synthase domains. In this project, we use polyketide synthase domains as a synthetic unit to diminish the size of the target gene fragments. Meanwhile, we optimize the linkers between domains. Furthermore, the host strain E. coli should be genetically modified in order to enable the synthesis of the corresponding substrate. In this way, polyketide synthase domains can be assembled more quickly, enabling the programmed polyketide synthesis. In addition, using our system, we can design polyketide independently. This system can select the corresponding synthesis polyketide synthase domains to synthetize polyketide programmedly.
