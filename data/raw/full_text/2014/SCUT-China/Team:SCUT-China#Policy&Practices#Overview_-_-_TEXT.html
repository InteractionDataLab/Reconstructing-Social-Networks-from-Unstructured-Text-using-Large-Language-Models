Overview
Toward Synthetic Biology, Toward A Better Life. ----To Combat Antimicrobial Resistance
To make a better influence to the public with our project, we did many efforts to popularize the concepts of synthetic biology, the antimicrobial resistance and the safety with these new technologies.
Achievements
1.We popularized synthetic biology combined with our project. We made antimicrobial resistance the theme of our policy & practices to let more people know about the safety of the synthetic biology.
2.We set our own assemble to provide synthetic biology information for the general public with a exhibition.
3.We built our own assemble to evaluate our policy & practices on the internet with a biological media
4.We sent group emails to life science community to popularize the safety and application in antimicrobial resistance of synthetic biology, and we got the percentages of people who successfully know about our propaganda by telephone visit.

Campus Activity
Public Outreach
Evaluation
As college student, the first step of our popularization was in the campus. We choose the students as our target objects and held a series of campus activities like delivering a lecture, visiting high school students, introducing synthetic biology in our campus open day.
In order to make the safety and application of synthetic biology accepted by more people, we did amount of efforts in the public outreach. The most influential we did is the synthetic biology exhibition in the Guangdong science center which let the public have a better understand of our theme, antimicrobial resistance.
We evaluated our method with the feedback from different people and analysis through our different filed of content.
Social Media
Life Science Community
The most efficient way to popularize the synthetic biology and antimicrobial resistance is through the media. There are many reports about what we did in public during the year, and we also published some articles in the journal of our school.
The ones who own the knowledge of skills to turn Synthetic Biology into real products are gathered in research labs of universities and companies. So we had in-depth discussion with 10 companies and got their support finally.
