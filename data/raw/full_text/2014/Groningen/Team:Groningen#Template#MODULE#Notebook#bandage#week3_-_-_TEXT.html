Growing a new overnight cultures and preparing the chemicals for the first polyacrylamide gels with L. lactis cells
 
Pouring a polyacrylamide hydrogel with Lactococcus lactis NZ9700 in it
 
Four polyacrylamide gels with different concentration were poured, one of 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, and 30 % acrylamide, we decided to continue with 20 % for now
 
Pouring a polyacrylamide gel containing an overnight culture, this gel is divided in four, two gels were freeze dried, and two more were incubated overnight at 30 °C with fresh M17 medium
 
These gels were checked by phase contrast microscopy after incubation overnight, a lot of cells were visible, but we could not distinguish the living of dead bacteria, therefore we decided to continue the experiment with an inducable GFP expressing strain
