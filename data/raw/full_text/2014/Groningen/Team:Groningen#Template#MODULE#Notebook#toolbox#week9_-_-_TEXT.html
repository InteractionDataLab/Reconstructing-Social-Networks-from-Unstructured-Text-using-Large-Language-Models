From 2014.igem.org
8 September - 14 September
 
A PCR was done on all the genes that contained illegal restriction sites: NisI, NisT, NisP and NisFEG. This should generate multiple PCR fragments for each gene, that will be assembled again using Gibson assembly. The PCR was split into two seperate reactions because of the large differences between the size of the different fragments. Fragments were sorted on <750 kb and >750 kb. The experiment was not continued because of time limits.
