Team:Groningen/Awards/Checklist
From 2014.igem.org
Groningen badge goals: Done, work in progress, Not done, wait until   possible
Bronze. The following 6 goals must be achieved:
Team registration.
Complete Judging form.
Team Wiki.
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs,   advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services. Please see the iGEM 2011 Imperial College Acknowledgements page for   an example. Our professors and help should be on the ‘Team’ page
Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry   (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). Please note you must submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry. Please see the Registry help page on   adding new parts. A new application and/or outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part   also counts. Please see the Registry help page on how to document your contributions. To fulfill this criteria, you will also need to submit the part with its original   part name to the Registry, following the submission guidelines.
Silver: In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements, the following 4 goals must be achieved:
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. (work in progress by   aakanksha)
Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. (work in progress after   aakanksha’s tests are done. </i>
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines). (SEND IT)
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice,   safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s)   within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted. (scenario is done, safety describtion for our bandage (otto and lianne are working   on it)
Gold: In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, any one or more of the following:
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this   information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part.  P2 – Plas (GFP behind it and see the difference) characterization (aakanksha working on it)
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their   system.(translating all the abstract, send information and plasmids to paris (by JW) (inform at HQ, send a mail)
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice,   safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach,   including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and   beyond iGEM). We encourage thoughtful and creative approaches, and those that draw on past Policy & Practice (formerly Human Practices) activities. We’re working on   safety and intellectual property rights, and plenty of human practices ofcourse (WIKI)
B2: we need to fill in the judging form for the jamboree, that way they will know what to judge us for.
B5: We must add all our supervisors, and also some names from companies who helped us
B6-S1-S2-S3: send our new Nisin part, validate, document and characterize.
S4: We have plenty for this, we need to add it to the wiki.
G1: P2 and PLas characterization
G2: done? Email the Hq (last check 18-9-2014)
G3: We need to describe more and add it to the wiki
