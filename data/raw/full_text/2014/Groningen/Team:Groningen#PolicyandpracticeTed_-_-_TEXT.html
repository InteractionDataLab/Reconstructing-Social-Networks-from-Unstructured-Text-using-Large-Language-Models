TEDxTwenteU – Ideas worth spreading. In the spirit of TED.com, a TEDx event will be organized at the 10th of October at the University of Twente. At a TEDx event, speakers will talk about their vision, ideas and inspirations in order to inspire the attendees and viewers. We will also be speaking at TEDx, and we hope to inspire many minds to think outside the box when tackling the problem of infections.
Get ready to be inspired at http://www.tedxtwenteu.nl/ ...!
