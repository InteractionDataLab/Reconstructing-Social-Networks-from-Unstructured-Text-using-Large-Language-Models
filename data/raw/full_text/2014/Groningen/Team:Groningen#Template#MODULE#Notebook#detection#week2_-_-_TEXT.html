A new batch of cmpetent E. coli DH5α was prepared
 
A ligation was performed with the purple-blue chromoprotein amilCP BioBrick ( BBa_K592025 ) together with the double terminator BioBrick ( BBa_ B0015 ) with the pSB2K3 vector
 
The ligation product was transformed to E. coli DH5α and plated on LB agar with kanamycin
 
An overnight culture was grown, and the plasmid was isolated out of the culture in order obtain a high concentration of construct
 
The construct was double digested, and checked on gel
