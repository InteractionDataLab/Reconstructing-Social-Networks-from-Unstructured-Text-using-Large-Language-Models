6 bandage designs
 
Studying the diffusion rates of Nisin, Aiia and DspB is important to estimate the time taken to reach the threshold concentrations. The threshold concentration is the minimum concentration of the proteins that is required to breakdown biofilm, kill Staphylococcus aureus and quorum quench Pseudomonas aeruginosa population. The diffusion constants for these three proteins were not available directly. They were calculated using number formulas. Diffusion rate inside the polyacrylamide gel is different from the diffusion in a solvent.
