Two ligation were performed, the first one was the purple-blue chromoprotein amilCP with the double terminator was ligated with promoter CP44 ( BBa_K1033225 ), the second one was the purple-blue chromoprotein amilCP with the double terminator was ligated with promoter CP29 ( BBa_K1033222 )
 
Both constructs were transformed to E. coli DH5α
 
Some blue colonies were visible on the plates, an overnight culture was prepared from these colonies
 
The plasmids were isolated out of the overnight cultures
 
The size of the constructs were digested, and checked on gel
