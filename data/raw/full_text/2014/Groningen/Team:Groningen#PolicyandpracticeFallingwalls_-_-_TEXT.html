Team:Groningen/PolicyandpracticeFallingwalls
From 2014.igem.org
Falling walls is a yearly science event in Berlin where researchers can tell how their walls breaks the  walls of humanity’s big problems. The day before the Falling walls conference, the falling walls lab is  organized, where young researchers can present their work. Speakers get three minutes to tell the  audience about their project, and convince them of its importance.
Andries went to the qualifying round in Groningen where he won us the first prize. After the iGEM  finale in Boston, he will fly back to Amsterdam, take the train to Berlin, and tell a large international  audience about our bandage on November 8.
