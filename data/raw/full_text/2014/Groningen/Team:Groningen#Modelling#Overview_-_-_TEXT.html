Modeling of the bandage; 6 designs compared!
You’ve probably seen our design on the front page of our wiki. If not, here is a link that describes the different components of the bandage in a more precise way (LINK). We are mainly interested in how fast and how much our three Infection Preventing Molecules (IPM’s) are diffusing into the wound. That makes our to-obtain-results clear:
1. Amount of nisin that diffuses from the bandage into the wound over time.
2. Amount of DspB that diffuses from the bandage into the the wound over time.
3. Amount of AiiA that diffuses from the bandage into the the wound over time.
These amounts can be found by modeling. We made six designs with different distributions of our L. lactis throughout the gel. These designs and their modeled diffusion results are displayed below.
General structure of the model:
- Diffusion equations
- Rate equations
