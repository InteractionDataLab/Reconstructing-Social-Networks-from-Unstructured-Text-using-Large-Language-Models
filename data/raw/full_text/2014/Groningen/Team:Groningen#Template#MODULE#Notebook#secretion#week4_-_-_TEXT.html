Assembling the promoters P2 ( BBa_I746103 ) and pLas ( BBa_K091117 ) with RBS and the gene coding for GFP ( BBa_ E0040 ) with double terminator ( BBa_ B0015 )
 
The Biobricks pLAS, P2, GFP, RBS and Double terminator were assembled using three-A assembly, the constructs were ligated, and transformed to E. coli DH5α
The transformations were plated on LB agar with kanamycin
All the colourless colonies were plated to fresh plates again, and grown overnight
The construct was checked by colony PCR, ending up with the following constructs: Ps with RBS, pLas with RBS, and the gene coding for GFP with double terminator
Another colony PCR was performed with Phusion polymerase this time, in order to produce a more clean product for a second assembly
The primers and the synthetic gene ssUSP45DspB ( BBa_K1365111 ) arrived
The mrfp insert was cut out of pSB1C3, run on gel, and the linearized vector was purified out of the gel
ssUSP45DspB was ligated with pSB1C3, and transformed to E. coli DH5α
Few colonies were visible after growing the transformation mixture of LB agar plates with chloramphenicol
After digestion, the constructs of the few colonies were checked on gel, only one colony showed the right size for the insert
