We validated and characterized the following BioBrick parts from our own project: NisA, and sfGFP
These parts were also submitted to the registry (links on the table are clickable)
We considered safety by having a safety lecture during our project, also there has been a safety assessment for our project
One part of our safety was a general talk with the burn wound center in Groningen, where we also discussed safety issues
Together with Synenergene several safety-concerning topics about synthetic biology were discussed and a scenario based on our project has been done
