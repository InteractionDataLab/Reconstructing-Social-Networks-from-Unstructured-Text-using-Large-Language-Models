Nisin diffusion tests performed with the polyacrylamide gel
 
A GM17 agar plate with L. lactis NZ9000 on it, this is a L. lactis strain that is sensitive for nisin, after which we made three holes in the agar how will we do this: We will start by pouring gm17 agar plates with the nz9000 strain on it, this is a strain that doesn't have any nisin resistance. While pouring we had 3 empty circles inside this agar plate where we can put in 3 small samples of acrylamid gel. This acrylamid gel contains the NZ9700 strain, this is a strain that can create nisin. It does this after induction with nisin.
 
Inside the three holes, polyacrylamide gels with the L. lactis nisin producing strain NZ9700
 
The three holes had slightly different conditions, one of the three wholes if filled with a gel, which was incubated overnight at 30 °C, the other two were filled with a freshly prepared gel of which one is not induced to produce nisin  Our first try didn't go to well because the gel didn't seem to touch the agar, diffusion wouldn't start.
 
During the first experiment we hardly received any results, most likely this was caused by the fact that the gel did not touch the agar
