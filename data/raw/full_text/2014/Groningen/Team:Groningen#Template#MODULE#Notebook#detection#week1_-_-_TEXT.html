From 2014.igem.org
July 28 - August 3
 
The following BioBricks were taken from the 2014 iGEM distribution kit, and transformed to E. coli DH5α
 
The double terminator( BBa_ B0015 )
The RBS( BBa_ B0034 )
The gene for the purple-blue chromoprotein amilCP( BBa_ K592025 )
The genes for the AIP sensor infrastructure( BBa_ I746101 )
The gene coding for GFP( BBa_ E0040 )
The lasR gene( BBa_ S03156 )
The promoter LasR( BBa_ R0079 )
The lasI protein generator( BBa_ K081009 )
 
 
All samples were digested, and checked on gel
 
From all transformations a glycerol stock was made, and stored at - 80 °C
