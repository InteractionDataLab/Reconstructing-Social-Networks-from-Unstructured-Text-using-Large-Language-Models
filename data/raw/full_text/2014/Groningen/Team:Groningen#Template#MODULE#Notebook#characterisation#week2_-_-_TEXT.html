From 2014.igem.org
September 8 - September 14
 
Obtaining the NisA ( BBa_K1365000 ) and the Superfolded GFP ( BBa_K1365020 ) BioBricks in larger concentration for further use
 
Transformed both, pSB1C3 containing the NisA BioBrick and pSB1C3 with the Superfolded GFP Biobrick, to two different E. coli DH5α strains
The transformations were checked on gel, and the desired bands were observed, therefore the transformation was most likely successful
The plasmids with the desired BioBricks were isolated out of E. coli DH5α, and glycerol stocks were made of the two strains containing the previous named parts
