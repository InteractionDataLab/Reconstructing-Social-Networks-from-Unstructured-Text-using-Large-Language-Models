From 2014.igem.org
14 July - 20 July
 
A collection of constitutive promoters was also desirable for the toolbox. We decided to use the CP promoter collection and test it in Lactococcus lactis, that was BioBricked by the Uppsala iGEM team of 2013. The CP promoters are registered as CP1 , CP8 , CP11 , CP29 , CP30 , CP41 and CP44 . These parts were ordered from iGEM HQ, except for CP8 as for this promoter the sequencing was inconsistent. The promoters were sent by iGEM HQ using Escherichia coli containing pSB1C3 with the promoter as insert. E. coli was grown and the plasmids with the promoter were isolated.
