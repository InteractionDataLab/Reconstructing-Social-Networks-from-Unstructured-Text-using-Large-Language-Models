Obtaining constructs with different promoters and the gene coding for GFP for promoter analysis in L. lactis
An overnight culture of E. coli DH5α with the P2 with RBS construct, pLas with RBS construct, and the gene coding for GFP with the double terminator construct was made
The constructs P2 with RBS, pLas with RBS, the gene coding for GFP with the double terminator and ssUSP45DspB were checked on gel, only P2 with RBS and pLas with RBS had the correct size
The same experiment with the ssUSP45DspB was performed again, but again no positive results were obtained
PCR was performed with the synthetic ssUSP45DspB gene, resulting in ssUSP45 and ssUSP45DspB without the His-tag
