From 2014.igem.org
 
 
 
This year all competing iGEM teams were encouraged to participate in the inter lab studies. In this study three specific devices expressing GFP were measured in labs around the globe. All the devices express GFP but under promoters with variable strengths and with plasmids which have different copy numbers. All these measurements should result in a set with a lot of data. This study will grant all teams a greater insight in the difference of a standard measurement.
