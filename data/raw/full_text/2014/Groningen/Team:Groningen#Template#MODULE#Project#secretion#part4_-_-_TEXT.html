The construct
In order to synchronize the secretion of infection preventing molecules with the detection of the certain pathogens, a few conditions must been set.
The construct should be regulated through detection.
It must secrete DspB when L. lactis senses both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus
It must secrete Aiia when it detect P. aeruginosa
It must secrete Nisin when it detects S. aureus
After designing the systems, two constructs came out:  The anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa system:

The anti-Staphylococcus aureus secretion system:
