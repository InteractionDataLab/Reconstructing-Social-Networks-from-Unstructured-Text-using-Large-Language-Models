Visit Martini hospital, a meeting with a nurse practitioner
 
Nearly halfway through our iGEM-adventure of creating an infection-detection-protection bandage for (burn) wounds, we got the opportunity to talk with some experts in the field. Of course, creating a ‘genetically engineered machine’ is what we do, but we want explore the application further. Having a talk with people that could eventually use our concept in real-life was therefore essential; if there is no need for this type of bandage, then there is no need to develop it!
 
In this story, we were given the opportunity to talk to a nurse practitioner at the burn centre Groningen. During a regular workweek she guides parents and patients throughout the whole healing process.
 
During the visit we learned things that helped us to put our bandage into context. For example:
 
In Groningen, most of the time the treatment starts with Flammacerium for at least three days. Chemical burns cannot be treated with Flammacerium. These wounds are treated with Flammazine instead
After a Flammacerium layer occurs, the wound is treated further with fatty gauze (Jelonet). This can be left in place for two or three days
Drying the wound is a very good treatment. Sometimes we do not need complicated “intelligent” methods, air is very effective as well
On the out patient clinic, S. aureus causes the most common infections. The infection can be treated well with Bactroban, which contains Mupirocin
Believes of people might cause some resistance to this product. Nowadays, for example, some people do not want blood transfusion because of what they believe. Be aware of this. Bacteria in general have negative connotations, this might cause some difficulties for introducing this product
Think about the comfort of the bandage; does it fit nicely, does it look nice and can it be removed and applied in an easy manner?
Keep the benefits and the costs of such a bandage in mind. If it truly is better, than it can be more expensive, but for just a small improvement there will be less room to manouver (financially speaking)
The nurse practitioner indicates that LactoAid will suit the clinical patients the best
Think about how to present your idea to the outside world; that is key to the acceptance
