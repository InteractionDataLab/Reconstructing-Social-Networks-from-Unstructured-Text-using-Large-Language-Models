From 2014.igem.org
September 29 - October 3
 
During the last few week several time lapse experiments were performed, with all kind of concentration of polyacrylamide gel, and also with agar and agarose gells, in order to L. lactis grow in the gel
 
Small gels were poured and incubated overnight in GM17 at 30 °C, two types of gels were used, an intact one, and a fractured one, this might have some effect on releasing some L. lactis cells from the gel
 
Several percentages of polyacrylamide gels were made, from 2.5 % until 15 % (2.5 - 5 - 7.5 - 10 - 12.5 - 15), the intact gels showed no growth, therefore we can conclude that L lactis is not able to grow in any percentage of polyacrylamide gel
 
From 2.5 % until 15 % L. lactis was able to grow on/in the fractured polyacrylamide gel, no growth was show on the higher percentages
