Team:Groningen/Team/Supervisors
From 2014.igem.org
Prof. Dr. Oscar Kuipers is the head of Molecular Genetics as well as the Confidential advisor for academic integrity on Zernike. He is the driving force behind iGEM Groningen. Every year he rallies a dozen new students to a conference room in the biology building gives them some advice and lets the run wild. Of course we regularly ask him for advice, but the fact that he lets us make our own decisions makes us strong as a team.
Jan-Willem Veening is an associate professor in microbiology and biotechnology & applied microbiology.
Renske van Raaphorst is an AIO in the molecular genetics group. She participated in the 2012 iGEM Groningen team which became world champion. She now provides us with advice from the perspective of a winner.
Ruud Detert Oude Weme is an AIO in the molecular genetics group. He was in the first iGEM Groningen team in 2008. He sits with us nearly every week in our weekly meetings where we show off to the supervisors (and also ask a bit of advice).
Dr. Bayu Jayawardhana is the university reader in mechatronics and control of nonlinear systems as well as   a member of the program advisory committee of Hanze Institute of Technology and chair of Industrial Engineering Management educational committee. He supervises our modelling team and gives us much needed advice from the viewpoint of a non-biologist, as ten out of twelve of our team are biologists.
