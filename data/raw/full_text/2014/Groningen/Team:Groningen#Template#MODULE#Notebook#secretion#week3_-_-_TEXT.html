Obtaining all the BioBricks needed for the secretion system to destroy P. aeruginosa and S. aureus
 
Performing three transformation to E. coli, one with promoter P2 ( BBa_I746104 ), one with lasI ( BBa_K081009 ), and one with aiiA ( BBa_C0060 )
The tranformated E. coli was divided in several concentrations over LB agar plates with Chloramphenicol
Three glycerol stocks of E. coli DH5α containing the RBS ( BBa_ B0034 ), the double terminator ( BBa_ B0015 ) and the promoter LasR ( BBa_ R0079 ), were inoculated in LB medium, and grown overnight
The plasmids were isolated out of the overnight cultures, and checked on gel
