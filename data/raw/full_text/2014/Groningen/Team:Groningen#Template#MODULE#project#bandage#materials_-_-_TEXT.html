Materials
 
20% PolyAcrylamide 1% crosslinked
0.2 micrometers bottom membrane, Cellulose nitrate - Ultipore Nylon
TPX top membrane (from the iGEM Groningen 2012 team)
It was hard to choose our final materials. We started thinking of the molecules that should be able to stay inside the bandage and also of those that should diffuse outside. Taken in account that we have three molecules that need to diffuse outside and also several ones that need come in. For this reason we needed a bottom layer that contains our bacteria inside while the molecules should diffuse freely. So our demands for the bottom layer are:
 
Small pore size (0.2 micron)
Permeable to proteins
Hydrophilic
Flexible
Shouldn't stick to a wound
At first we thought of using Polysulfone, polyamide 66 or an acrylate copolymer. After consulting with several company's they came up with several idea's: Ultipore Nylon and EKV/PES (Pall) and a Cellulose Nitrate membrane (Sartorius) All of these could work fine although we would prefer a transparent membrane. After some research we could not find a membrane which was transparent.
