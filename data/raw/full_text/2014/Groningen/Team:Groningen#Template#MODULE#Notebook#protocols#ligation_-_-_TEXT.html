Ligation
For ligation of DNA fragments 1U T4 DNA ligase was used. The amount of vector DNA that is used is 20 - 100 ng. The amount of insert in ng can be calculated using (ng of vector * kb of insert)/kb of vector * R with R being the molar ratio of the insert over the vector. The mixture is incubated for 1 hour at roomtemperature. After incubation, 5 μl of the mixture can be used for the transformation of 50 μl chemically competent cells or 1 μl for electrocompetent cells.
