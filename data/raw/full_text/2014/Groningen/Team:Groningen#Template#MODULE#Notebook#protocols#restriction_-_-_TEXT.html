Restriction
For restriction FastDigest enzymes from Thermo Scientific were used. For digestion of up to 1 μg DNA, 0.8 μl enzyme is used. The reaction is incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes. The enzymes are then deactivated by cleaning the restrictionmixture using the PCR Purification Kit from Thermo Scientific or by incubating the mixture at 80 °C for 20 minutes.
