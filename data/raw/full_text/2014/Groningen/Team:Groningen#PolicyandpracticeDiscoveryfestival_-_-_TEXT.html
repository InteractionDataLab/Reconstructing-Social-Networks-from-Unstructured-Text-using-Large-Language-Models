Team:Groningen/PolicyandpracticeDiscoveryfestival
From 2014.igem.org
September the 26th the iGEM team 2014 will present at Discovery festival Amsterdam 2014 .
Discovery festival is, as the name says, a festival celebrating science and music. It was started in Amsterdam in 2006 because the founders of Discovery festival observed a lack of  events combining these two cornerstones of civilisation.
Dicoveryfestival was great!
