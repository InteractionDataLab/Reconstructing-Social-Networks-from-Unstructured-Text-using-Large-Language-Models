Team:Groningen/PolicyandpracticeDenacht
From 2014.igem.org
Due to the 400th anniversary of the University of Groningen, ScienceLinX organized several  expositions throughout Groningen, and one spectacular evening, with all kinds of artists and events.  The evening, better known as the “Night of Arts and Sciences” took place at the 24th  of May.
We were lucky enough to get a spot in the Der Aa-Kerk in the centre of the city during the “Night  of Arts and Sciences”. Throughout the exposition, the project of the iGEM 2012 team of Groningen  was shown to warm the public. At the night itself, we introduced synthetic biology, the iGEM  competition, and our bandage to the public. People were able to win a small consumable prize if they  answered a sufficient amount of question of our quiz correctly. All in all a successful night!
