TEDxTwente
 
At the 10th of October the University of Twente organized an independent TED event. The theme of the day was “find your creative spark”, and we were welcomed to share our idea of LactoAid. During the day there were several talks about many different topics. From music to cooking in a hot air balloon, from soccer to medical devices. Thomas Meijer represented us here, and told the public a more about the synthetic biology and LactoAid. An inspiring day where our creative spark was found!

Fundraiser
 
The 23rd of September our team invited family and friends to come and visit our lab, and to explain them  more about what we had been working on the past few months. We still had to contribute quite a lot for our trip to Boston, so a fundraiser could help us on the financial side. Everybody that was interested could come, get a drink and listen to some relaxing music from the band Frankly no Helix. We started off with a short presentation, after which people were given the opportunity to ‘take a tour’ through our lab. A great way to show them the work that we have been doing!  After the lab-tours were finished (a lot of people wanted to do this!) we started an auction. The things that went up for auction (lab-slaves, arm candy, boatrides) appeared surprisingly appealing to many of the audience. At the end of the day we had collected 850 euro, but more importantly, we made our project visible to the people around us. This could be repeated the upcoming years!
