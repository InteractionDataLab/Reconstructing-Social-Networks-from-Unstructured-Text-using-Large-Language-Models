Bandage specifications & requirements
 
Specifications
1. Top layer: Transparent polymethylpentene membrane permeable to gases, flexible.
2. Middle layer: Polyacrylamide hydrogel containing the chemically defined media.
3. Bottom layer: This layer acts as barrier between the wound and the ''L. lactis'' cells. They are inactive since the gel is normally in dehydrated form. This layer consists of a cellulose nitrate membrane of pore size 0.2 micrometers, permeable to protein, being hydrophilic and flexible.
 
 
Requirements
Most of the requirements were found by placing ourselves in the minds of end-users and derived from interviews with people working at the Martini hospital.
 
1. Start-up: breaking of the water pockets and hydrating gel/activating L. lactis.
2. Operation: growth of L. lactis, detecting quorum molecules and secreting Nisin, AiiA, DspB.
3. Shut-down: nutrient depletion, cell destruction.
 
Requirement
Value
Note
Activation time
3 h
Time required for the gel to hydrate after water pockets have been broken to be fully hydrated.
Therapeutic action time
4h
After being applied to the wound. Amount of time for reaching the inhibitory concentrations of nisin, DspB and AiiA to pass the bottom membrane and into the wound.
Inhibitory nisin concentration
2-16 ng/µL
This concentration can be used for both MRSA and VRE. Source: Nisin, alone and combined with peptidoglycan-modulating antibiotics: activity ……. Brumfitt, Salton, Hamilton-Miller.
Inhibitory AiiA concentration
15 ng/µL
How much is needed to inhibit growth of PA/SA?
Inhibitory DspB concentration
15 ng/µL
How much is needed to inhibit growth of PA/SA?
Operating temperature
20-40 °C
Lifetime
3 days
