October 6 - October 12
 
Two of the ligation mixtures stored at -20 °C, were transformed again to L. lactis (using more higher concentrations of ligation mixture this time), the mixture of mrfp with pIL253 vector, and the mixture of promoter CP29, with RBS and the Superfolded GFP gene with the pNZ8048g vector
 
This time the transformation with pIL253 was succesfull
 
The size of the construct was checked by colony PCR
