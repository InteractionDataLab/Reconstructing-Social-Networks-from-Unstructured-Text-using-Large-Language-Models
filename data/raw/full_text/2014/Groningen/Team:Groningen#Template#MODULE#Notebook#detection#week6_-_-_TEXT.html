The size of the construct was determined by colony PCR
 
The cultures, which showed positive results for the colony PCR were inoculated in fresh LB media containing the corresponding antibiotics
 
Two new ligations were performed, the lasR double terminator was ligated with Promoter CP29, and the gene coding for GFP double terminator was ligated with the RBS
 
The two new construct were both transformed to two different batches of E. coli DH5α
