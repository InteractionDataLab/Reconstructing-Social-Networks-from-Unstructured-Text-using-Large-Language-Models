1 September - 7 September
 
Colony PCR on more transformants containing pSB1C3 with NisB and NisRK was repeated, using VF2 and VR . This time, a  correct insert size wasbfound for a NisRK transformant.
Because there was still no correct insert size found for a NisB  transformant, the remaining NisB colonies were tested for a correct insert size. There were no positive transformants found.
