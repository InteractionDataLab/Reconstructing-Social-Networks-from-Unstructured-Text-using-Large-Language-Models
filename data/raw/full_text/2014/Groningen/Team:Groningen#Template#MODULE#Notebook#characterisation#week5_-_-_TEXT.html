Testing the promoter collection containing CP1 ( BBa_K1033219 ), CP11 ( BBa_K1033220 ), CP29 ( BBa_K1033221 ), CP30 ( BBa_K1033223 ), CP41 ( BBa_K1033224 ) and CP44 ( BBa_K1033225 ), and testing the newly formed RBS-NisA-double terminator ( BBa_K1365556 ) and RBS-Superfolded GFP-double terminator ( BBa_K1365555 ) BioBricks
 
The RBS-NisA-double terminator BioBrick was ligated with CP29 and CP44 from the promoter collection
The RBS-Superfolded GFP-double terminator BioBricks was ligated with all the promoters of the promoter collection
