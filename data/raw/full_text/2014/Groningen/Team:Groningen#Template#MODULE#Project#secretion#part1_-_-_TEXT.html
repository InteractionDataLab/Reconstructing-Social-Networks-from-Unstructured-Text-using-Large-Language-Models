The secreting system
In order to exterminate the Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, the genetically engineered Lactococcus lactis NZ9800 needs to secrete a couple of infection preventing molecules. For P. aeruginosa these molecules will be Dispersin B and AHL lactonase, coded by the genes dspB and aiiA. For S. aureus these molecules will be Dispersin B and nisin coded by the genes dspB and nisA. We chose these enzymes to create a hostile environment for these pathogens. Whilst the effects of these molecules differ from each other, a regulated release of these proteins will cause the pathogens to lose their virulence and even kill some of them. Also, the regulated response against these pathogens will reduce the chance of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus to become resistant against these infection preventing molecules. Controlling the virulence with these molecules is key to a good treatment of infected burn wounds.
