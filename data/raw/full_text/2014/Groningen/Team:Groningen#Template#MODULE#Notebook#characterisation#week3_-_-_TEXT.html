Fusion of the NisA BioBrick ( BBa_K1365000 ) and the Superfolded GFP BioBrick ( BBa_K1365020 ) with a double terminator ( BBa_B0015 )
 
The size of the plasmids were confirmed by single and double digestion of the plasmids (pSB1C3) with the NisA and Superfolded GFP BioBricks to confirm the sizes of the plasmids
Both, the NisA and the Superfolded GFP BioBricks, were ligated into pSB1A3 together with the double terminator as a second insert
The ligation was performed overnight, after which the ligated plasmids were transformed to two different E. coli DH5α strains
The size of the construct was determined by colony PCR
A double digestion was performed, and the constructs were further purified
