Nine DH5α strain containing each a different insert were inoculated from the glycerol stock, resulting in a culture containing the following parts: the double terminator ( BBa_ B0015 ), the RBS, the genes for the AIP sensor infrastructure ( BBa_ I746101 ), the gene coding for GFP ( BBa_ E0040 ), the promoter CP29 ( BBa_K1033222 ), the lasR gene ( BBa_ S03156 ), the lasI protein generator ( BBa_ K081009 ), pSB1C3 with mrfp pSB1C3 ), and pSB1A3 with mrfp pSB1A3 )
 
The plasmids containing the parts were isolated out of the cultures, and the mentioned part were digested and purified out of the plasmid.
 
Three ligation were perfomed, the lasR with the double terminator, the gene coding for GFP with the double terminator, and lasI protein generator
 
All ligation mixtures were transformed to E. coli DH5α
