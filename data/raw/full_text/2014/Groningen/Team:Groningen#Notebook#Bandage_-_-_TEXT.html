From 2014.igem.org
Week 1 (2-4 July)
Two strains of L. lactis (NZ9800 & NZ9700) were freeze dried and kept in -80 to see if they could be revived the next week.
Week 2 (7-11 July)
Growth of the two L. lactis strains was tested by resuspending them in medium and letting them grow overnight. They grew very fast. The experiment was repeated with a lower starting concentration, and they still grew very fast.
Week 3 (14-18 July)
(Nothing)
Week 4 (21-25 July)
A culture of L. lactis was made to put in polyacrylamide gels.
Polyacrylamide gels were made at 15, 20, 25 and 30% polyacrylamide with L. lactis in it to see if the bacteria grow in the gel. They grew best in 20% polyacrylamide, thus a new gel with bacteria in it was made. A quarter was freeze dried immediately, another quarter was incubated for 45 minutes at 37 degrees, ther other two quarters were incubated overnight.
Cells were found in all quarters.

Week 5 (28 July-1 August)
A stock solution was made of pNZ8048G, a strain containing GFP. It was tested by activating the GFP with ZnSO4.
Week 6 (4-8 August)
To increase survival of L. lactis, a new gel was made on ice. The gel did not solidify. Another gel was made with the GFP strain inside, but the GFP did not show when activated with ZnSO4.
