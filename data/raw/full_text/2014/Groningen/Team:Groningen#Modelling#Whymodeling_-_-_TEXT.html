Team:Groningen/Modelling/Whymodeling
From 2014.igem.org
The main focus of the modeling in this project lies in aiding the development of the actual prototype. The results from modeling should help the design of a bandage that detects pathogens in burnwounds and secretes molecules that either kill- or inhibit growth of these pathogens. Key here is the ability to produce nisin, DspB and AHLase upon sensing quorum molecules from the pathogens.
In order to provide useful information to the ‘material’-people in our team, we made a first model that shows how nisin, DspB and AHLase are produced by L. lactis and diffuse through the bandage. By using this model, we can estimate which of six possible designs (LINK) is the best.
Awesome! The ‘why modeling’-question has been answered, let’s start!
