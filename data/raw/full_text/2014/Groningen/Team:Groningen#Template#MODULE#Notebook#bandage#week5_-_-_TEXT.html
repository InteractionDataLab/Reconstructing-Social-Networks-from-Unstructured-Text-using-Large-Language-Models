From 2014.igem.org
4 August - 8 August
 
This time we'll try pouring a gel on ice. This is because during the solidifying of acrylamid there is a lot of heat, we were a bit scared this heat could destroy our cells. Unfortunately the solidifying process will slow down to a point that it will take more then an hour to complete. We've decided that this wouldn't work, so we continue without using ice.
 
Poured a gell with the GFP strain. Freeze a half, and the other half was put into the stove. The next day these were both incubated with ZnSO4 for an hour. After an hour of incubating this didn't give any results. Incubation time should be longer the next time.
