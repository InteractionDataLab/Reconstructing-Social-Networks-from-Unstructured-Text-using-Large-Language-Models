Visit Martini hospital, a meeting with the medical microbiologist and the medical director
 
On the thirteenth of August our team visited the burn centre at the Martini hospital in Groningen. We were immediately reminded that we were in a hospital, where due to the vulnerable patients and the increased risk of infections, strict hygienic measures are implemented. This was demonstrated by first moving through a lock chamber, after which we were dressed in blue scrubs to keep unwanted bacteria out of the centre.  We were led through the centre, and had a talk with the medical microbiologist and the medical director of the burn centre in Groningen.

During the visit we learned things that helped us to put our bandage into context.For example:
 
If 20% of a patient’s skin is covered with burn wounds, there is a high chance of infections. These infections are mainly caused by Gram-negative bacteria
Groningen does not perform surgery if a patient is infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa because the chances of this surgery being successful is decreased.
Currently the mostly used treatment method in Groningen is the application of Cerium, it neutralizes the dead skin, and has a positive effect on the inflammatory process and subsequently on the wound healing.  Effect of Cerium is diminished if a biofilm is present in the wound.
For colonization caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Bactroban is used. This drug contains Mupirocin, which is an antiseptic.
To assess the chances of an infection, samples of the nose, mouth and wounds are taken from patients. These samples are then grown on five different types of plates that are selective for different pathogens. In this centre they use stamps instead of swaps from the wound. When the stamps show a certain type of growth, the doctor either calls for action or leaves it to be.
In some cases of P. aeruginosa infection, patients are treated with a bath therapy. This treatment reduces P. aeruginosa in the bath, after which the wounds will be left open to the air to dry.
When we asked about application of growth factors in the wound, the specialists indicated that there is a possible benefit in wound healing.
 
 
Apart from being informative, this visit brought us back to why we are actually developing this bandage. It also reminded us of all the other factors that need to be addressed in the design (e.g. user comfort and applicability). We are glad that the burn centre allowed us a visit!
