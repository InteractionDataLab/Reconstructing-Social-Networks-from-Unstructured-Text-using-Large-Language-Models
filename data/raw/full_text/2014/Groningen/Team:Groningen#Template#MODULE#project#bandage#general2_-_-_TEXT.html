Planning of sub-parts
 
What exactly do we have to do to make a bandage?
 
Try to find several gel materials in which the bacteria are able to grow
Check for growth in the gel, also with several revival fluids. This could be media, normal water or demi-water.
Check whether our bacteria are trapped inside the bandage.
Testing of sub-parts
 
Test different kinds of gels (PAA %) for their strength and applicability
Test if IPM's (Infection Preventing Molecules) can diffuse through the gel
Test if the cells survive and revive after freeze drying
Test if our bacteria are stuck inside the gel
