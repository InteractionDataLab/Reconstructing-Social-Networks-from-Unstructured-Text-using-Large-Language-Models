Figure 3: The L. lactis NZ9000 with pNZ8048g, seen through a phase contrast microscope, on the right the GFP channel is displayed
 
 
August 18 - August 22
 
Pouring a polyacrylamide gel with an overnight culture of L. lactis NZ9000 with pNZ8048g, the gel was split into several parts, and the parts were observed after certain time-spams divided over two weeks
