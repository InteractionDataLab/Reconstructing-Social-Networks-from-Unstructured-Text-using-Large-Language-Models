The anti-quorum sensing molecule
AiiA
Bacteria use certain specific molecules to communicate with each other, also known as quorum sensing molecules. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa one of these molecules is the acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) molecule. This is important because communication between bacteria with these molecules can up-regulate virulence genes8, thereby worsening the infection.
AiiA is a molecule that can enzymatically degrade the AHL molecules and thereby inhibit the quorum sensing between the pathogens. The AiiA molecule is part of the lactonase group. These enzymes can cut the ring in the AHL molecules, thereby inactivating the quorum sensing molecules9. Although quorum sensing is inhibited, these molecules do not interfere with basal life processes such as general RNA and protein synthesis of the bacteria, and growth, therefore it is conceivable that the selective pressure for development of resistance is minimized.  Inhibiting the quorum sensing between the pathogens has several benefits. One of these benefits is the down regulation of virulence genes. Another benefit is that AiiA will decrease the ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to form biofilms, making them more susceptible to conventional antibiotics and the action of the host immune system10. The inhibition of AHL molecules also disturbs some of the motility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa11.
By secreting this molecule through our bandage, the Gram-negative pathogens can be battled. Although we can not kill the pathogens, they will become less virulent, less motile, decrease the ability to form biofilms an thus make them more susceptible to the human immune system.
