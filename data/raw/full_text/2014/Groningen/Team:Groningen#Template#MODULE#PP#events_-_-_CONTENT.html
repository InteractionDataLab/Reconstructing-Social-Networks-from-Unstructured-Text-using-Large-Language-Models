We enjoyed the hospitality of the Wageningen team, and liked the conversation and the set-up of the first meet up. We liked the whole day, but one thing: The travelling! Going to Wageningen was not the problem, but returning home was the hard part. Once we were in the mood for an even more fun evening, it was already quite late, and we needed to travel back. We decided it would be more fun to extend the day even more. Therefore we decided to organize a second meet up, with a more informal set-up including a sleep over. 
At the 13th of September the day started with some drinks, while sharing our progress. After the talks about the project, we went to the pizzeria with all the teams present (unfortunately the Delft-Leiden team could not be present). We showed all the teams some nice and cheap places to stay in Groningen beforehand, and the Wageningen team decided to spend the night in Groningen.
All in all an informative day!

It is a night in which we shortly explain synthetic biology and its (possible) uses in everyday life. To start from scratch we will make some agar plates and see what bacteria live on various parts of your room/phone/body. A first essential step used everyday in synthetic biology!

The meeting was arranged via ScienceLinx, an organization within the University of Groningen, which is supporting high schools and their students. They like to promote science among high school students, and this year they asked us whether we would like to help them to organize a practical in the synthetic biology.
At nine in the morning the students arrived, and after an introduction talk we brought them to the lab. The group was divided in two: one group was able to transform pSB1C3 (the most commonly used plasmid within the iGEM competition) to <I>E. coli</I> DH5α. The other group was working hard to do exactly the opposite. Their task was to isolate pSB1C3 out of <I>E. coli</I> DH5α.
Once the practical work was done, the students were told about iGEM, and the bandage we (the Groningen team) are making for the competition this year. The students were very enthusiastic, and interesting questions were asked.
In the end the students made a comic about the practical work. A nice result of one of the comics is shown here on our wiki.
The day was closed in a proper way by having a drink and discussing the day.

You can compare this institute with the FDA and CDC.
The idea came from the RIVM to start a yearly information market about synthetic biology. They just started following all the Dutch iGEM teams more closely and want to close the gap between the teams and some companies. They also wanted to introduce iGEM to people who might be able to help the teams in several ways. Furthermore, this meeting gave an opportunity to discuss the possibilities of an iGEM application.
The day was such a success, that the RIVM wants to make yearly event of it. This year it started small with only a few companies, and they hope to enlarge this in the next few years. We got some really useful information regarding our project and we liked the fact that the RIVM was willing to get to know synthetic biology.
Until next year!

The evening, better known as the “Night of Arts and Sciences” took place on May 24.
We were lucky enough to get a spot in the Der Aa-Kerk in the centre of the city during the “Night of Arts and Sciences”. Throughout the exposition, the project of the iGEM 2012 team of Groningen was shown to warm the public. At the night itself, we introduced synthetic biology, the iGEM competition, and our bandage to the public. People were able to win a small consumable prize if they answered a sufficient amount of questions from our quiz correctly. All in all a successful night!

We still had to contribute quite a lot for our trip to Boston, so a fundraiser could help us on the financial side. Everybody who was interested could come, get a drink and listen to some relaxing music from the band Frankly no Helix.
We started off with a short presentation, after which people were given the opportunity to ‘take a tour’ through our lab. A great way to show them the work that we have been doing! 
After the lab-tours were finished (a lot of people wanted to do this!) we started an auction. The things that went up for auction (lab-slaves, arm candy, boatrides) appeared surprisingly appealing to many of the audience. At the end of the day we had collected 850 euro, but more importantly, we made our project visible to the people around us. This could be repeated in the upcoming years!

They suggested to share our ideas and give feedback to one and another. After the formal presentations they welcomed us to have a barbecue with them, and the other teams. 
Held on June 21, this day started with all the presentations at the university complex in Wageningen. This formal part consisted of several talks. First of all there were the talks of every individual 2014 iGEM team, questions were asked and advice was given. Some “old” iGEM members were invited as well, to tell about their project and to share their experiences. Some people from the RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment) were also invited, and they were given an opportunity to speak. They offered a cooperation between the iGEM teams and the RIVM, because they want to inform more people about the synthetic biology and its opportunities. However, they considered it very hard to promote the synthetic biology in a proper way. They arranged an information marked on the 17th of September with all the Dutch iGEM team, and invited several people to visit this day. You can find more about this day on this page.
After all the formalities we went to another part of Wageningen, where we enjoyed a well-organized barbecue. The teams started to get to know each other, and several people spoke about organizing a second meet up. In the end we (the Groningen) team decided to organize a second meet up in a more informal setting.
It was a very successful day, and a nice first introduction to the other teams and their projects!
