Devices measured
 
These were the devices given by us to the iGEM headquarters:
Device 1 : J23101-B0032-E0040-B0015 in pSB3K3
Device 2 : J23101-B0032-E0040-B0015 in pSB1C3
Device 3 : J23115-B0032-E0040-B0015 in pSB1C3
 
 
 
 
Fluorescence data
 
From the three devices we measured the following data.
 
 
Figure 1: As can be seen here, the device on the right did not show good fluorescence.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This year all competing iGEM teams were encouraged to participate in the inter lab studies. In this study three specific devices expressing GFP were measured in labs around the globe. All the devices express GFP but under promoters with variable strengths and with plasmids which have different copy numbers. All these measurements should result in a set with a lot of data. This study will grant all teams a greater insight in the difference of a standard measurement.
