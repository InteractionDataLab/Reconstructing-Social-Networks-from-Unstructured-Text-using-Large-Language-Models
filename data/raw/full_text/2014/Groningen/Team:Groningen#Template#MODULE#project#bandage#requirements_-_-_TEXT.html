Team:Groningen/Template/MODULE/project/bandage/requirements
From 2014.igem.org
Design requirements:
 
It should not be toxic to humans or our bacteria inside the bandage
The top membrane should be permeable to gases, so the wound still has a oxygen suply
It should be durable and preferably inexpensive
It should not break too easily and it should be flexible. To a point that a person could be able to move around freely
It should not stick to the wound
The bandage could be stored for at least a month,preferably 6-12 months
Easy and quick to active, a simple press on the bandage should be enough. Preferably the bandage can be actived within 30 minutes
