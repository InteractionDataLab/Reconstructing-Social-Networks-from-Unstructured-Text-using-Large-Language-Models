Fusion of the NisA with the double terminator and Superfolded GFP with the terminator constructs with the RBS BioBrick ( BBa_B0034 ) and purification of the promoter collection  of Uppsala containing the following promoters: CP1 ( BBa_K1033219 ), CP11 ( BBa_K1033220 ), CP29 ( BBa_K1033221 ), CP30 ( BBa_K1033223 ), CP41 ( BBa_K1033224 ) and CP44 ( BBa_K1033225 )
 
Both, the NisA with the double terminator and Superfolded GFP with the terminator constructs, were ligated into pSB1K3 together with the RBS BioBrick as a second insert
The ligation was performed overnight, after which the ligated plasmids were transformed to two different E. coli DH5α strains
The size of the construct was determined by colony PCR
Several positive clones were inoculated, and their plasmids were isolated after inoculation
