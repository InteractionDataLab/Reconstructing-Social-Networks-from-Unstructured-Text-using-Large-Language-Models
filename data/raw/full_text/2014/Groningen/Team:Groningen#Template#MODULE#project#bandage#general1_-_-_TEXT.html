Measurements
 
We want to add a color system which shows whether there is an infection of S. aureus or P. aeruginosa in the wound. The detection will activate as soon as the first bacteria is in sight. For the testing the detection constructs can be coupled to a GFP(or a lumniscent) signal.
 
Appearance
 
Our bandage should be transparent. In this way you can look through the bandage and judge whether it should be changed or it can stay on for another day, or whether you need to see a doctor. Seeing through the bandage without having to remove it is one of the criteria for the burn wound center as well.  Of course the bandage should be as thin as possible. We are aiming at a maximum thickness of one centimeter and a minimum thickness of 3 millimeter.
 
Safety
 
We have to make sure our bacteria stays inside the gel. Although it is unlikely that L. lactis infects a human, it is possible when the immune system is compromised. We can make sure the bacteria can not leave the bandage by adjusting the pore-size of this gel. Another extra safety point is the usage of a bottom membrane. This membrane will have a pore-size of 0.2um to make sure our molecules can diffuse, but the bacteria are stuck inside. Since we are aiming for hospital usage the bandage can be autoclaved or burned after use, and thrown away in the regular waste.
 
Comfort & User friendliness
 
The bandage should not stick, burns are painful wounds and we don't want to make it worse. Secondly it is important that the bandage can be activated easily. This should be within 30 minutes minimize the risk of getting infected. Also one of the requirements is the thickness the bandage, and mainly the thickness of the hydrogel. The thinner the bandage is the quicker the diffusion, and thus the quicker the treatment. Also the flexibillity of the bandage is important, the bandage should be waerable.
