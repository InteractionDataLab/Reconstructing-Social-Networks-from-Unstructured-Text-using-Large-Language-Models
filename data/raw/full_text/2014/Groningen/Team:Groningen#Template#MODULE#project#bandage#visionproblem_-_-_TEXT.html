From 2014.igem.org
The problem, and our vision
 
The problem - customer needs
 
Hospitals need to replace bandages several times a day, our bandage could inprove this to 3-4 days.
3rd world countries need cheap and easy antibiotics - wound treatments,without increasing the risk at antibiotic resistance.
Burn wound centers are in enthousiastic about our bandage, because infections could be detected sooner.
A novel way is needed to fight antibiotic resistant strains4.
What would the ideal product be?
 
A product usable for hospitals and customers. Able to activate in 30 minutes and easy to neutralize.
What would it look like?
 
A completely transparent bandage, this way the consumer of nurse can decide whether the wound needs attention or not.
What would it do?
 
Cool down the wound, increase wound healing and avoid infection by P. aeruginosa and S. aureus and if infection already happened, the bandage will fight the infection.
Who is your external costumer?
 
For now we aim on hospital usage. In this way the disposal and usage of the bandage can be controlled. We would like to bring it to the public as well but then we need to meet a lot more requirements.

Fighting the bacteria works! A great halo is shown.
