Our Idea
Long before the advent of modern science, it was recognized that certain plants are             capable of producing compounds of immense value.
From a single class of molecule, the terpenoids, come properties including agents with therapeutic             qualities against maladies ranging from cancer to infection, antimicrobials, natural pesticides,             rich flavorants, and fragrant scents.
However, the utilization of these remarkable compounds has been severely hindered by their rarity             in nature: many are found in only a small number of species and produced at levels measured in             parts per million2. Synthetic biology offers an opportunity to resolve this problem, by applying             metabolic engineering in order to create cellular factories. Our project seeks to use the ideas of             synthetic biology to develop a commercially viable strategy for the efficient production of a wide             range of terpenoids.

Our Approach
We believe that common brewer's yeast, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is an excellent platform for             engineering terpenoid biosynthetic pathways.
The mevalonic acid pathway endogenous to yeast produces the key isoprenoid intermediates that are the             precursors to virtually all terpenoid biosynthesis3.
Genes encoding plant synthases can then be recombinantly expressed in yeast cells, which then take that             isoprenoid substrate and convert it through one or more steps             into the final terpenoid product.
A specially designed biobrick shuttle vector developed by our team should make the process convenient and             reliable, by allowing us to first amplify plasmids containing             our gene of interest in E. coli and permitting the integration of synthase genes directly into the yeast             genome through homologous recombination.
A carefully-refined protocol is expected to further improve product yield, by extracting genetic sequences             directly from plant genomic DNA and mating cells to form diploid transformants.
Combined, our approach promises to be an effective manufacturing platform for these precious             (and sweet-smelling) compounds.
