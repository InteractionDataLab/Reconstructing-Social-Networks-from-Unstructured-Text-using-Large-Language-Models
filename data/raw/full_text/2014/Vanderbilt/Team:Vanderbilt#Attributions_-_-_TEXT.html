Attributions
While Vanderbilt University's iGEM team is driven by its undergraduates, our work is indebted to the generosity of our mentors and gracious sponsors. Vanderbilt iGEM prides itself in being a team run by undergraduates, for undergraduates. All project design and data analysis, lab work and experimentation, fundraising and outreach, and all the other work done by the team was all preformed by undergraduate student volunteers. However outside companies, faculty and staff, institutions, and individuals all have made contributions that have been essential in our team's growth and success. We would like to take the time to specially thank each one of them in the space below.
