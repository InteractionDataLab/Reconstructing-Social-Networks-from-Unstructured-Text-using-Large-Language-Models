Through the use of open source design software and cheap manufacturing methods we were able to fabricate microfluidic devices in a cost and time efficient manner.

Initially, traditional computer aided design software packages were used such as AutoCAD and Solidworks. These packages provide advanced features which designers can wield to make complex devices with varying functions such as mixing and trapping cells. Alternative software packages were explored such as the open source vector graphics software Inkscape which proved to be easy to use in the design of a microfluidic device. Inkscape is an open source analogue to Adobe Illustrator, a common vector graphics editing software. Inkscape is easy to use and with a few online tutorials, ideas for microfluidic designs can be turned into realities.";        var p2 = subPage.createP(text);

var text = "In order to rapidly prototype microfluidic devices of different geometries and designs, our team explored fabrication techniques that bypassed the complicated photolithography process that is standard for microfluidic devices in research laboratories. Photolithography has the benefit of achieving very fine resolution and fine details for pinpoint fluid manipulation, but it is detracted from its lengthy creation process. The time scale from device design to fabrication of a working device using photolithography is on the order of 2-3 days and uses a variety of expensive and highly technical equipment that is not readily accessible to many iGEM teams. ";        var p1 = subPage.createP(text);
text = "Our team focused on bypassing the entire photolithography process by using a commercially available arts and crafts vinyl cutter (Silhouette) to produce device masters. Arts and crafts vinyl cutters are typically used to craft complex shapes and figures for use in decorations. A vinyl cutter has a resolution on the order of 250 microns which means that the devices made using this technique are considerably larger than those made using standard photolithography techniques. While the devices obtained from vinyl cutting are larger, for many synthetic biology applications this is not an issue. For the purpose of E. chrono, the size of the channels simply affected the total amount of fluid needing to be pumped into the device.";        var p2 = subPage.createP(text);
text = "As mentioned previously, the main benefit of using a vinyl cutter is the rapid production of microfluidic masters. A vinyl cutter is able to take a device design to a master and ultimately a device in roughly an hour. By simplifying and speeding up the design and fabrication process, vinyl cutting can allow iGEM teams with no microfluidic knowledge to rapidly develop their own devices for testing. Using an open source design software such as Inkscape allows a team to rapidly formulate and then test a microfluidic device within an afternoon.";
