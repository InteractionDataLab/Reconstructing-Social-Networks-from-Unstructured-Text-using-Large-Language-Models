           &quot;industry when considering just their applications in the food and fragrance industries 1. A staggering 23 &quot; +
           &quot;million kilograms of citrus oil alone are produced worldwide each year. Up until only a couple decades ago, &quot; +
           &quot;the production of these essential oils was done exclusively by chemical extraction from plant material. &quot; +
           &quot;However, the sudden emergence of synthetic biology a versatile and efficient tool has the potential to &quot; +
           &quot;transform this immense industry, the products of which nearly everyone will come in contact with on a daily &quot; +

       &quot;malleable model systems, it will be possible to significantly improve on current methods of the active &quot; +
       &quot;components of essential oils, most notably the terpenoids. While most plants express terpenes in the range of &quot; +
       &quot;parts per million and thus require very large scale operations to be commercially viable, early forays into the &quot; +
       &quot;biological production of terpenes have proven that it is possible to improve yields 100-fold 2. We selected a &quot; +
       &quot;total of nine different terpenes to produce (see table), each of which has practical applications which make &quot; +
       &quot;them prime candidates for alternate means of production. The first aspect of our project involves using the &quot; +
       &quot;great potential of synthetic biology to design a commercially-viable strategy for the production of any class &quot; +
       &quot;of terpenoid. &quot;;

</PRE><PRE>       text = &quot;Just as important to the economic benefit of this approach is its environment benefit. With chemical &quot; +
       &quot;terpene extraction being such a relatively inefficient process, it is necessary to process large amounts of &quot; +
       &quot;plant material to get a substantive yield. This may not pose as significant of an issue for citrus growers, but&quot; +
       &quot; many of the most prized compounds are taken from the rarest species of plant. The continuation of the status quo &quot; +
       &quot;in terms of terpene extraction is not an environmentally sustainable solution. In our selection of terpenes, we &quot; +
       &quot;placed a large emphasis on choosing compounds from some of the most rare species possible. &quot;;
       var p3 = subPage.createP(text);
</PRE><PRE>       text = &quot;The best example of this idea behind our project can be seen in the gene for santalene synthase. The only &quot; +
       &quot;species know to have genes to produce this terpene are found in remote regions of India and Australia, and one &quot; +
       &quot;of them is listed as a vulnerable species by the IUCN. The trees can live for hundreds of years, but are the &quot; +
       &quot;target of widespread over-exploitation, to the point that, for example, the Indian government has banned the &quot; +
       &quot;export of sandalwood. Synthetic biology can produce the exact same active ingredients of sandalwood oil in a &quot; +
       &quot;way that is both more economically and environmentally sound. &quot;;
       var p4 = subPage.createP(text);
</PRE><PRE>       text = &quot;In order for our idea to truly be applicable to exotic and endangered species of plant, we had to take an &quot; +
       &quot;approach that was quite different from the one most iGEM teams have historically taken. What we were looking for &quot; +
       &quot;was a quick, inexpensive method of cloning genes that was also compatible with species that have not had their &quot; +
       &quot;entire genomes sequenced. Often, iGEM teams resort to synthesizing their genes through third parties. However, &quot; +
       &quot;this can be fairly costly especially given the moderately large size of many of these synthase genes, may take &quot; +
       &quot;several weeks or even a month to finish synthesizing, and cannot be done unless the gene's sequence is known in &quot; +
       &quot;its entirety. By going back to basics and taking raw plants as our source material, we were able to avoid these &quot; +
       &quot;issues and demonstrated how our approach was a practically viable one.&quot;;

           &quot;(commonly farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) or garnyl pyrophosphate (GPP)) to the final terpene product. As it &quot; +
           &quot;happens, two well established and genetically manipulable model organisms- the bacterium Escherichia coli &quot; +

</PRE><PRE>       text = &quot;Yeast initially was our main target for a few advantages it appeared to have as a production platform. &quot; +
       &quot;First, the MEV pathway is found in all eukaryotes including plants and fungi, so better yield were expected by &quot; +
       &quot;choosing it over the MEP pathway in prokaryotes4. Second, it would be possible to physically integrate our gene&quot; +
       &quot; into one of the yeast's chromosomes by using homologous recombination. An inducible promoter could be included&quot; +
       &quot; to further increase production. Third, as a diploid the yeast could be made homozygous for the terpene gene. We&quot; +
       &quot; soon found out that no exiting vector had all of the features we would want. Therefore, we designed our own new&quot; +
       &quot; plasmid vector, pVU140006, that contained a number of important features and advances over previous plasmids for&quot; +

           &quot;roughly be divided into two categories: the first involving work on our synthase genes and the second&quot; +
           &quot; involving the construction of a new, specially designed plasmid vector. We tried two different team &quot; +
           &quot;structures over the year to see which would give the best results. For the Spring, we had the original &quot; +
           &quot;idea of dividing members into independent groups, each working on a specific terpene. Each group was &quot; +
           &quot;headed by a single group manager who would teach 4-5 new members the protocol that was to be preformed &quot; +
           &quot;and then supervise that the work was carried out correctly. On occasion either the group managers or the&quot; +
           &quot; organization president or wetware director would also given lessons to teach members about the techniques&quot; +
           &quot; and theory involved at each step. All group managers were in turn trained by either the president &quot; +
           &quot;or wetware director, both of whom had come with the experiment, acquired all the necessary primers and r&quot; +
           &quot;eagents, wrote up the protocol, and had preformed it prior to any group-phase work for the purposes of t&quot; +
           &quot;roubleshooting and predicting where issues may come up. The president or wetware director also helped the&quot; +
           &quot; group manager in being present during all experiments for answering questions, preparing materials, and &quot; +
           &quot;other forms of assistance.&quot;;

       &quot; Vanderbilt Greenhouse. Once the majority of these grew into saplings with green leaves, Samples were flash froz&quot; +
       &quot;en in liquid nitrogen in preparation for a genomic DNA extraction. After the extractions, nanodrop concentration&quot; +
       &quot; readings and agarose gels confirmed the presence of high molecular weight genomic DNA. Groups then ran a PCR on&quot; +
       &quot; their genomic DNA with primers specific to their synthase gene. More gels were run to check for PCR product. At&quot; +
       &quot; this point, the semester was coming to an end, so groups were disbanded before most managed to isolate their sy&quot; +
       &quot;nthase gene. Over the summer, the president and wetware director continued troubleshooting those genes which wer&quot; +
       &quot;e not amplifying and eventually got each to the point where consistent PCR product bands were produced. &quot;;
       var p2 = subPage.createP(text);
</PRE><PRE>       text = &quot;Once we had clear banding patterns, it became clear that the number of introns in each of our genes (a &quot; +
       &quot;variable which was unknown since most of the plants we worked with have not had their genomes sequenced) was too &quot; +
       &quot;great for cloning and expression to be practical. Therefore, as soon as the fall semester began, we shifted strat&quot; +
       &quot;egy to isolating RNA from our plants. This RNA could be converted to cDNA by reverse transcription, which would e&quot; +
       &quot;liminate the issue with introns we were having. Several of our greenhouse plants were no longer available, so w&quot; +
       &quot;e reduced the number of target terpenes we were focusing on. After extracting RNA and running an RT-PCR, severa&quot; +
       &quot;l samples produced bands that corresponded roughly to where the synthase gene should be. These were gel extract&quot; +
       &quot;ed. Because almost every synthase gene had restriction sites in them that prevented them from being RFC10 compa&quot; +
       &quot;tible, we ligated the genes in pUC19 for site directed mutagenesis. After that, a second processing step would &quot; +
       &quot;have been necessary to add the correct restriction sites to each gene to allow them to be integrated into pSB1C&quot; +
       &quot;3 as a biobrick. In the interest of time, we synthesized a codon-optimized santalene synthase gene in order to &quot; +
       &quot;skip these RFC10 processing steps, even though we had already successfully reverse transcribed cDNA of the san&quot; +

       &quot;te for our final plasmid was first identified in an existing, readily available plasmid. All of these cassettes &quot; +
       &quot;were extracted by PCR using those plasmids as templates. Overlap extension PCR was then done on the gel-purifie&quot; +
       &quot;d product to add restriction sites and homology regions for the purposes of eventually combining all of the cas&quot; +
       &quot;settes together into a single plasmid. By the end of the summer, only one final fragment remained to be inserte&quot; +
       &quot;d to complete the intermediate plasmid pVU14004. Upon the successful creation of pVU14004, several restriction&quot; +

           &quot;ments added a substantial dimension of difficulty to the project since all of our starting material (both t&quot; +
           &quot;he extracted gene cassettes for plasmid construction and the synthase genes) contained multiple sites that &quot; +

           &quot;ram to aid in the manipulation of genetic sequences. We used the program as if it were for a real project &quot; +
