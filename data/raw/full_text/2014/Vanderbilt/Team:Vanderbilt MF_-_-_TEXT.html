E. Chrono
Vanderbilt University Microfluidics
E. chrono attempts to merge synthetic biology and microfluidics into a novel hybrid system. The goal of E. chrono is to leverage quorum sensing in ''Escherichia coli'' to produce a microfluidic based fluorescent watch.  The E. chrono project focused on 3 major goals
1)Learn the microfluidic device design process and select a software platform capable of rapid design
2)Develop a cheap and efficient means for rapid prototyping of microfluidic devices
3)Fabricate and test microfluidic designs
Additionally, E. chrono sought to produce a cheap and efficient methodology for the rapid fabrication and prototyping of microfluidic devices. It is our hope that the designs and methods implemented in our project can be utilized in future competitions by other iGEM teams.
Below is an artist rendering of our intended E. coli watch.
