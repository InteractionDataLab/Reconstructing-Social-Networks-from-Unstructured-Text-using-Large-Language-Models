Vanderbilt Microfluidics is supported by the Vanderbilt Institute for Integrative Biosystems Research and Education (VIIBRE), part of the Vanderbilt University Biomedical Engineering and Physics department. VIIBRE is a well established microfluidics research institute with projects focusing on organ on a chip (OoC) devices and high throughput screening devices.
In addition to support from VIIBRE, the Vanderbilt Microfluidics team is supported by the Searle Systems Biology and Bioengineering Undergraduate Research Experience (SyBBURE). SyBBURE seeks to educate students in research techniques and enable undergraduates to perform cutting edge research in a variety of disciplines. Support from SyBBURE was integral to founding and funding the Vanderbilt Microfluidics team.
