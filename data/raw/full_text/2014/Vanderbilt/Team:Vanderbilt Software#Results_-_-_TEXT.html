We produced software which implemented the algorithms described in our novel approach on specially cleaned input files and ran them through a typical version control system. We performed experimentation on transformations between iterations 3-6 of our wetware team's yeast plasmids. As a control, we compared darwin's output running through the git version control system to simple processing with git (vanilla_git). We expected darwin to run faster and show fewer changed lines in the diff output than vanilla_git.
Speed of file processing in darwin vs. vanilla_git
Line changes in darwin vs. vanilla_git
As expected, darwin's preprocessing produced a significantly faster diff, with an average speed of 5.763 seconds per file, as opposed to 10.640 seconds for the vanilla_git. However, against our assumptions, that performance did not seem to rely upon the reduction of changed lines reported by git, since darwin actually produced more changed lines. More research is required to find the correlation between the number of changed lines reported by git and the number of lines actually changed in the file.
