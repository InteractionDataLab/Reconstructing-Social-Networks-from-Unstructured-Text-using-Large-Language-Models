While most plants express terpenes in the range of " +        "parts per million and thus require very large scale operations to be commercially viable, early forays into the " +        "biological production of terpenes have proven that it is possible to improve yields 100-fold 2. We selected a " +        "total of nine different terpenes to produce (see table), each of which has practical applications which make " +        "them prime candidates for alternate means of production.

This may not pose as significant of an issue for citrus growers, but" +        " many of the most prized compounds are taken from the rarest species of plant. The continuation of the status quo " +        "in terms of terpene extraction is not an environmentally sustainable solution.
