TOOLBOX to
ATTACH
First of all, check the DNA sequence of your proteins for EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI and BsaI sites. If there are E/X/S/P sites, you might have problems to change your backbone or add a promotor. If there is a BsaI site, the cloning will be more difficult.
There is no BsaI site.
There is a BsaI site.
At which position do you want to add your posttranslational modification?
N-terminal
C-terminal
Does your protein of interest have methionin as a first amino acid?
No
Yes
Protocol
Get BBa_K1362141 (RBS + SspDnaB C-intein RFC [] assembly construct) from the registry of standard biological parts. Get BBa_K1362110 (RBS + SspDnaX-S11 N-intein RFC [] assembly construct) from the registry of standard biological parts.
Divide your protein of interest into a short N-terminal part including the synthetic attachment and a long C-terminal one. a long N-terminal part including the synthetic attachment and a short C-terminal one.
Get the DNA of the long part of your protein of interest.
The long part of your protein of interest will be expressed recombinantly. Therefore design and order primers for this part:
In 5&apos;-3&apos; direction, the forward primer should have the following sequence:
NNNNNNGGTCTCCCAACAGCATTCGCAGC+ binding part NNNNNNGGTCTCCGATG + binding part NNNNNNGGTCTCCG + binding part
In 5&apos;-3&apos; direction, the reverse primer should have the following sequence:
NNNNNNGGTCTCTATTA + binding part NNNNNNGGTCTCGAGCAACCAGATTCACGCAG + binding part
Use PCR to create your insert and purify it.
Use Golden Gate assembly to insert the recombinant part of your protein of interest into BBa_K1362141 (SspDnaB C-intein RFC [???] assembly construct) BBa_K1362110  (SspDnaX N-intein RFC [???] assembly construct)
Since there is a BsaI site in your protein, you have to religate after the Golden Gate reaction.
Induce expression.
Purify the protein.
Synthesize the short part of your protein including the posttranslational modification together with the split intein sequence.
The sequence should look like this:
N-terminal protein part with modification - SEFSGCISGDSLISLA GLLVHNCHT - C-terminal protein part with modification
Mix both parts in vitro to induce protein trans-splicing.
