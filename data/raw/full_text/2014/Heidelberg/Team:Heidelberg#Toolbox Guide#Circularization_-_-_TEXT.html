TOOLBOX to
CIRCULARIZE
Please go to www.rcsb.org and get a pdb file of your protein. If the 3D structure of your protein is known, we will be able to provide you an appropriate linker.
If the 3D structure is unknown, we will help you to find a set of potentially suitable linkers.
I’ve found one.
The 3D structure of my protein is unknown
Additionally, check the DNA sequence of your proteins for EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI and BsaI recognition sites. If there are E/X/S/P sites, you might have problems to change your backbone or add a promotor. If there is a BsaI recognition site, the cloning will be more difficult.
There is no BsaI site.
There is a BsaI site.
Do you want to use split inteins or sortase to circularize your protein?
NpuDnaE intein RFC circularization construct
Successfully used in our project
High efficiency
In vivo circularization
Sortase A circularization construct
In vitro more efficient
Reversible
Not successfully tested by us
Can your protein be easily expressed in E. coli?
Yes, no problem.
No, I will have to add Smt3 .
Which exteins do you want to use? They will remain as scars in your circular protein.

If you want to save time, check manually whether the ends are close together (approx. Å or closer). For example, you can use the Swiss-PdbViewer or PyMOL .
They are close together.

Please use to generate a linker for your circular protein. [LINK]    This step might take up to 11 days.

In order to generate your linker, needs to know the scar amino acid sequence that is caused by circularization. In your case, it is .
Hello again. What is the result of ?
I do not need a linker.
The linker + scars are < 15 amino acids in length.
The linker + scars are betweeen 16 and 30 amino acids in length.
The linker + scars are > 30 amino acids in length.
Have you decided to use one linker or try different linkers?
I trust . One should be enough.
I want to test several linkers.
How large is your protein?
Less than 50 amino acids
50-150 amino acids
151-300 amino acids
301-500 amino acids
501-700 amino acids
More than 700 amino acids
Protocol:
Get BBa_K1362000123 NpuDnaE intein RFC Sortase A circularization construct (with FLAG and Smt3)(with His6)(with Smt3 and His6) from the registry.
Get the DNA of the protein you want to circularize.
We recommend you to try circularization without a linker and with flexible GS-linkers of different lenghts up to 81015202530 amino acids (including exteins).
Backtranslate the amino acid sequence of your linkers to a nucleic acid sequence. Be aware of:
Balanced GC-content
Restriction sites (especially PstI)
Codon usage
Avoid self annealing
Design and order primers for your protein insert.
In 5'-3' direction, the forward primer should have the following sequence:
CT GGTCTCA CAACGGGTTGCTGGGAATGCTTCAACTGC + binding part     (=additional random nucleotides, BsaI site, RFC E overhang, CWE, CFN, Cys)
In 5'-3' direction, the reverse primer should have the following sequence:
CT GGTCTCT + binding part      (=additional random nucleotides, BsaI site) CT GGTCTCT AGCAGAAG TTTACCACG GGTACCACGATATTCCGC + linker sequence (reverse complement) + binding part      (=additional random nucleotides, BsaI site, RFC Boverhang , RGK, RGT, AEY reverse complement)
For any additional linker you want to test, you just need one additional reverse primer with the corresponding reverse complement linker DNA sequence.
The Tm values of the binding parts should be between 60 °C and 70 °C and as similar as possible.
Design and order oligos for your linker inserts.
In 5'-3' direction, the forward oligostrand should have the following sequence:
Last 4 nucleotides of your protein + linker sequence + CGTGGTAAA (=RGK)CGTGGTACC (=RGT)GCGGAATAT (=AEY)
In 5'-3' direction, the reverse oligostrand should have the following sequence:
AGCAGAAG TTTACCACGGGTACCACGATATTCCGC + linker sequence (reverse complement)        (=RFC B overhang , RGK), RGT, AEYreverse complement)
Probably these oligos would be longer than 90 nucleotides. In this case we recommend you to split the insert into several smaller inserts and order them as pairs of oligos. Use overhangs of 4-6 nucleotides and be careful that every overhang remains unique.      The largest linker we have successfully cloned this way was composed of 65 amino acids. ] For any additional linker you want to test, you just need another linker insert with the corresponding linker sequence.
Anneal your linker inserts as described here -LINK ZU MAT/MET ANNEALING-.
Use a Touchdown-Twostep PCR -LINK ZU MAT/MET TOUCHDOWNTWOSTEPPCR- to create your protein insert and purify it.
Use Golden Gate assembly –LINK ZU MAT/MET GOLDEN GATE ASSEMBLY (CYCLING) to replace the mRFP selection marker in the circularization construct with your insert.both your protein insert and your linker inserts.
Because your annealed oligos are not 5'-phosphorylated, you have to add T4-polynucleotide kinase to the Golden Gate reaction.
Since there is a BsaI site in your protein, you have to religate – LINK ZU MAT/MET RELIGATION after the Golden Gate reaction.
Add an inducible promotor by standard biobrick cloning or use one of our pSBX vectors –LINK ZU PSBX VECTOR-TEXT.
Express your circular protein. If you are using our pSBX vectors, you can follow this protocol –LINK ZU PROTOKOLL EXPRESSION
