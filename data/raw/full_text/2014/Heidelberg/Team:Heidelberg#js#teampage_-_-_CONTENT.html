   &quot;Name&quot; : &quot;Max Horn&quot;,  
   &quot;img&quot; : &quot;/wiki/images/a/a7/Heidelberg_MaxH.jpg&quot;,
   &quot;Description&quot; : &quot;'But after this has finished, I also want to do something in the wetlab', was one of the sentences most characterizing Max. He is definitely the software guy of the team. Compared to his programming, what we others coded was playing around with code blocks. For him it was always, the lower the level, the better. Therefore he is writing pure C code, as C++ does already too much by itself, he thinks. But still, he was somehow pressed to this role, as normally he is studying molecular biotechnology in 5th semester now. As iGEM@home was running, and he thought he would have a break from programming, the wiki as a project came upon him. On top, he is a perfectionist on software sides, so not only once he called out: 'Nils, look how smooth the ring is moving!'&quot;
 },
 &quot;Charlotte&quot;: {
   &quot;Name&quot; : &quot;Charlotte Bunne&quot;, 
   &quot;img&quot; : &quot;/wiki/images/6/69/Heidelberg_Charlotte.jpg&quot;,
   &quot;Description&quot; : &quot;Charlotte is our youngest team member and already participated in iGEM in Germany´s first High School team in 2012. Studying Biosciences in her third semester, she impresses all team members with her energy, curiosity and ambition. She is the creative head behind nearly all artworks of our project. The wiki design originates from her imaginations and the BOINC video as well as the cover picture for our theme night “Religion and Synthetic Biology” arose from her hands. In team effort with Nils, she is conducting the linker screening experiments for the lysozyme circularization. In the course of these experiments Charlotte learned huge organisational skills that directs her abilities and energy into the right channels. In this way Charlotte became an indispensable team member.&quot;
 },
 &quot;Nils&quot;: {
   &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Nils Klughammer&quot;, 
   &quot;img&quot; : &quot;/wiki/images/f/ff/Heidelberg_Nils.jpg&quot;,
   &quot;Description&quot; : &quot;Nils will always be referred as the physicist in our team, because he implemented the whole CRAUT software and the lysozyme modelling. Furthermore he resigned to stand in the wet lab, and if just in full safety equipment – welling boots, helmet and welding goggles, was everything just to contaminated for him. Nils held the most motivation for circularisation, and were one oft he main leaders for ideas. Due to his structure, coordinate, and healthy life style, involvement in student parties he was very important in pulling the team together.&quot;
 },
 &quot;Silvan&quot;: {

   &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;Carolin Schmelas&quot;,
   &quot;img&quot; : &quot;/wiki/images/4/49/Heidelberg_Carolin.jpg&quot;,
   &quot;Description&quot; : &quot;Caro is studying both biology with focus on neuroscience and Psychologies. When hearing her Whohoo exclamation, the whole team started to smile. It meant Caro was happy, because her CPEC cloning had worked, the split fluorescence protein gloomed, or she was deeply inLOV. For the youngest of us she was somehow the mummy oft he lab, sometimes demanding, sometimes treating, forgiving, sometimes the princess, always the winner.&quot;

   &quot;Description&quot; : &quot;Max also called Captain Sharky,is a 3rd year student in Molecular Biotechnology. He was responsible for a huge load of cloning stuff and the expert when it comes to circularization. He is not only the most successfull team member when it comes to handling 40 minipreps at one time (NEVER mixing up samples), but also the most sporty one. Outside the lab he enjoys sports and learning Russian.&quot;

   &quot;Description&quot; : &quot;Anna is a 2nd year student in Molecular Biotechnology and the expert for DNMT1. She has been fascinated about this protein (and of course especially about its circularization) from beginning until the very end of the project: The last days before wikifreeze she eveb moved into the lab - bringing her tooth brush and  sleeping bag. Outside the lab she enjoys sailing on the Neckar in Heidelberg.&quot;
