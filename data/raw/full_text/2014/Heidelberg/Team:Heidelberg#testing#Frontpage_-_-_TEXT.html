Dieser Text soll reinhauen.
Am besten sollte er richtig gut sein!

circular heat-stable
DNMT1
Wouldn´t it be great to amplify DNA in a normal PCR maintaining the epigenetic information coded in methylation patterns?
The problem: DNMT I, an enzyme which is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of the individual methylation pattern of different cell types, is not heat stable.      For iGEM 2014 we therefore create a PCR 2.0 with heat-stable DNMT I by circularization.

Xylanase
Xylanase is an important enzyme for the pulp and paper industry.
Bla bla
In future Xylanase could be used for the production of biofuel.

LINK it!
Could every protein becomes heat stable by circularization even if it´s the complexest of all?
Circularization is a narrow path between heat-stability and loss of function due to deformation. We developed a linker software, which predict the most suitable linker depending on the folding structure of every protein.
In an extensive linker screening our software was improved and calibrated using the lambda phage lysozyme.
CALCULATE it!
After calculating eleven days and the breakdown of both computational and mental power we decided to spread the modeling of the linkers.
The iGEM Team Heidelberg developed iGEM@home , a software to divide extensive computing task into many packages and to distribute them to many computers. Now over 1.000 volunteers are calculating for us when their are idle.
As a new tool for the iGEM community this system enables every student team to archieve their modeling without access to big server farms.
