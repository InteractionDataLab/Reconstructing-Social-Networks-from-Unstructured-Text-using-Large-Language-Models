MidnightDoc
– Documentation
ABSTRACT
In addition to simply recording experiments, MidnightDoc empowers its user with a protocols and supplies database. These three components are interlinked to enable retraceability and propagation of information to future experiments by assigning user-defined types to supplies and the sources and products of protocols and experiments. A concise definition of these four key structures and their relations are described herein.
