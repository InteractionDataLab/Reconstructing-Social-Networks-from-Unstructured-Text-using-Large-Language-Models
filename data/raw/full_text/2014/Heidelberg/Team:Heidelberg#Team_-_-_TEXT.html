TEAM
– Behind the Ideas and the Data.
Students and Supervisors
To realize such a big project many people are needed. Meet all team members, read something about their character and see them in Boston!
Collaboration
Following the spirit of iGEM to encourage students from various scientific fields to work in a team we collaborate with different teams. We helped the iGEM Team Aachen and the iGEM Team Tübingen sending them our expression vectors to solve wet-lab problems. Click to read more!
Attributions
In the elaboration of our project we had many open questions and tasks we could not handle alone. A big thank you to all people helping and supporting us. Read more!
Sponsoring
Our project was funded by many sponsors. Without them, our work would not have been possible.
