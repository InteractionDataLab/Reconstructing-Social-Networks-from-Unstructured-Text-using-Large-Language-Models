The Software
iGEM@home is a software that divides extensive computing task into many packages allows everybod to get involved with our science. Read more about it!
The Software
Circularization is a narrow path between gaining heat-stability and loosing function due to deformation.  We developed a linker software, which predict the perfect linker depending on the folding structure of every protein.
The Software
MidnightDoc is the new way of lab documentation – enabling backtraces of experiments and provides an easy to use platform for protocol management and result logging!
The Implementation
Here you can find a detailed description about the implementation of iGEM@home. Click here to read more about  Java- and Python-embedding for distribution via the BOINC platform.
The Documentation
Here is the documentation of our CRAUT (Circularization with Rods and Angles of Unlinked Termini) software that predicts and ranks linkers built of rigid helical patterns and angles.
The Graph
MidnightDoc's design principles make it easy to generate a graphical representation of the work done in the lab. Check out our lab notebook section to see an example!
