THE RING
OF FIRE
Click here to view our abstract.
Scroll down to EXPLORE our project.
Nature has made many curious inventions. One of these are
CIRCULAR PROTEINS
which are unconventional peptides that neither have a beginning, nor an ending
These proteins are extremely resistant against high temperatures, pH changes and proteases.
We established protein circularization as a new
powerful tool for Synthetic Biology and set the foundations
to render any protein heat stable.
Wondering how we circularize?
Let us introduce you to the next generation of bioengineering...
come DISCOVER the MECHANISM of SPLIT INTEINS
Inteins excise themselves out of proteins and in doing so the remaining flanking parts are irreversibly joined
– an effective mechanism to circularize proteins.
But messing with protein structure can be disastrous,
you can only win with good MODELING .
Find out the EXCITING THEORY
behind RIGID LINKERS and their ANGLES
We developed CRAUT ,
a comprehensive software which identifies
the optimal path to connect a protein’s termini
preserving structure and function.
Look at our extensive wet-lab SCREENING to improve and calibrate our software using lambda lysozyme !
As calculations on protein structures are costly
we involved the rest of the world with
iGEM@home
Empowering science!
NEW PLATFORM for distributed computing.
Volunteers provide the idle calacity of their home computers.
And, with an established user base with more than 1000 computers, we effectively bring synthetic biology to society in a new way!
Our Application:
circular heat-stable
DNA-methyltransferase
Wouldn´t it be great to amplify DNA preserving the encoded epigenetic information?
This could lead to an ENTIRELY NEW way of performing PCRs with a heat stable methyltransferase !
 
We'd like to call it
PCR 2.0
  CIRCULARIZATION
  OLIGOMERIZATION
  FUSION
  ON/OFF
  PURIFICATION
One more thing.
Inteins are capable of much more!
We show you the world of
post-translational MODIFICATIONS
We created an INTEIN TOOLBOX so you can easily modify your protein in a standardized way.
Take a look at our RFC !
Explore all our tools!
Who are we?
We are the iGEM Team Heidelberg 2014 consisting of 12 highly motivated bachelor and master students studying at Heidelberg University.
For our project we got great feedback and support from our supervisors.
Take a look at our Teampage !
Thank you!
We want thank all people who helped us and supported our work in the lab.
