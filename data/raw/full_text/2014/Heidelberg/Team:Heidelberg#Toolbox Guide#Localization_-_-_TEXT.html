TOOLBOX to
LOCALIZE
First of all, check the DNA sequence of your proteins for EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI and BsaI sites. If there are E/X/S/P sites, you might have problems to change your backbone or add a promotor. If there is a BsaI site, the cloning will be more difficult.
There is no BsaI site.
There is a BsaI site.
Choose the tag you want to add or remove
iGEMHD Tags (collection of usefull tags based on Biobricks)
Custom Tag
Please select the organism in that the tag should be used
Escherichia coli
eukaryotic organism
Which Tag would you like to use?
()
Do you want to add or remove the Tag
Add tag to protein
Remove tag via intein protease
At which Poition do you want to addremove the tag?
N-Terminus
C-Terminus
Does your protein of interest contain methionin as a first amino acid?
Yes
No
Does your protein of interest contain a stop codon?
Yes
No
How do you want to induce the trans-splicing reaction?
regulation of gene expression
light induction
Protocol
Get BBa_K1362105 (RBS + NpuDnaE C-intein RFC [] assembly construct) from the registry of standard biological parts.
Get BBa_K1362104 (RBS +NpuDnaE N-intein RFC [] assembly construct) from the registry registry of standard biological parts.
Get your tag from the registry of standard biological parts.
Get the DNA of your protein of interest.
Use Golden Gate Assembly to replace the mRFP selection marker in BBa_K1362105 (RBS   + NpuDnaE C-intein RFC [] assembly construct) with  the C-terminal tag. Use Golden Gate Assembly to replace the mRFP selection marker in BBa_K1362104 (RBS + NpuDnaE N-intein RFC [] assembly construct) with  the N-terminal tag.
Design and order primers
In 5'-3 direction, the forward primer should have the following sequence:
NNNNNNNNGGTCTCCCAACTGCTGGGAA + binding part NNNNNNNNGGTCTCAGATG + binding part NNNNNNNNGGTCTCAGATG + binding part
In 5'-3' direction, the reverse primer should have the following sequence:
binding part + NNNNNNNNGGTCTCTATTA binding part + NNNNNNNNGGTCTCGAGCACTTGCCCCT
Be careful not to include stop codons of your protein of interest into the binding part.
Use PCR to create your insert and purify it.
Use Golden Gate Assembly to replace the mRFP selection marker in BBa_K1362105 (RBS + SspDnaE C-intein RFC [] assembly construct) with your C-terminal tag BBa_K1362104 (RBS + SspDnaE N-intein RFC [] assembly construct). With your N-terminal tag.
Backtranslate the amino acid sequence of your protein of interest into a nucleotide
Design and order primers:
In 5'-3' direction, the forward primer should have the following sequence:
NNNNNNGGTCTCAGATG + binding part NNNNNNGGTCTCAG + binding part
In 5'-3' direction, the reverse primer should have the following sequence:
NNNNNNNNGGTCTCGAGCACTTGCCCCT + binding part
Be careful not to include stop codons of your protein of interest into the binding part.
In 5'-3' direction, the forward primer should have the following sequence:
NNNNNNGGTCTCCCAACTGCTGGGAA + binding part
In 5'-3' direction, the reverse primer should have the following sequence:
NNNNNNGGTCTCTATTA + binding part
Use PCR to create your insert and purify it.
Use Golden Gate assembly to  to exchange the mRFP selection marker in BBa_K1362104 ( SspDnaE N-intein RFC [] assembly construct)  with your insert. BBa_K1362105 ( SspDnaE C-intein RFC [] assembly construct)  with your insert.
Since there is a BsaI site in your protein, you have to religate after the Golden Gate reaction.
Clone both assembly constructs into compatible expression vectors.
