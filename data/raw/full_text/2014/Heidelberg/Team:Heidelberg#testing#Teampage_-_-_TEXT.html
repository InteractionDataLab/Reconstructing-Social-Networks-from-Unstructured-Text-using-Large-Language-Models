Our Team
We are a group of young and motivated students, and patient and  motivated supervisors, who love synthetic biology and wish to make an  important contribution to its advancement and acceptance by society.  This year we have a nice mix of wet-lab experts (who made tons and  tons of assays) and computer freaks (who wrote millions of code  lines). Plus a crazy physicist (who did many, many things – but not  involving a pipette!). Like good split inteins, we like to work only when assembled in a team!
