Controlling gene expression in a condition and tissue specific manner is a desirable tool for a wide variety of applications ranging from fundamental bioscience research to gene therapy. Having this idea in mind, it is inevitable to consider the starting point of gene expression: the promoter. Most efforts of obtaining any promoter focus on cloning them from nature. In eukaryotes, this approach leads to several problems. The one major issue is the complexity of eukaryotic systems resulting in cross-talk between pathways. In particular, promoters tend to respond to several transcription factors and are thus activated by more than one pathway. That way, one cannot determine which signal originally induced the promoter. Alongside this specificity, induction under a desired combination of conditions and at defined strengths would be valuable implementations. </P><P>Therefore, efforts have emerged to synthetically construct promoters. Two concepts of synthetic promoters in mammalian cells co-exist independently from each other. One is the concept of &quot;genetic switches&quot; (see <A href="#References">[2]</A> for a recent review) - promoters which can specifically be induced by a stimulus mammalian cells and are usually insensitive to, e.g. tetracycline <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[3]</A>. Much fewer efforts have been put into developing promoters sensitive to <I>endogenous</I> signals (referred to as &quot;synthetic promoters&quot; in the rest of this article). Such promoters are of very high value for a broad variety of applications. Three examples should demonstrate this: First, in virotherapy for cancer and other diseases, it has become a desire to express toxic genes only in affected cells (reviewed in <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[4]</A>). For example, breast cancer cells are characterized by high levels of estrogen receptor. Constructing a promoter which is active only at high estrogen receptor levels (preferable only in cells which are irradiated, as ER can be very active in other tissues of the female reproductive tract<A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[17]</A>) might therefore help developing novel breast cancer therapies. Second, biologists studying pathway interactions are in need for transcriptional assays, that being promoters which are specifically activated by a single transcription factor. Third, the concept can be transferred to plants, where synthetic promoters can be very valuable, as plant biotechnology is always in need for novel tissue- or development-specific promoters.</P><DIV class="pull-left col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-8 col-xs-12"><DIV class="thumbnail"><DIV class="caption"><SPAN style="font-weight:bold;">Figure 2) Ein anderer Titel</SPAN><P>Ganz viel Beschreibung, ganz viel Beschreibung, ganz viel Beschreibung, ganz viel Beschreibung... etc</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>

Three approaches exist to construct synthetic promoters responsive to endogenous factors. First, the structure of promoters is modeled by generating large data sets describing the relative spacing and coincidence of transcription factors (reviewed in <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[5]</A>). To our knowledge, such predictions have not been tested <I>in vivo</I>. Second, promoters are generated by randomly or repeatedly cloning response elements upstream of a core promoter. In our understanding, repeated cloning of response elements works well <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[6]</A> and is frequently applied, but no suggestions exist on how to apply this strategy to the generation of more complexly regulated promoters. The random creation of promoters works well to generate constitutive promoters <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[7]</A> and was even applied to broadly identify activating elements  <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[8]</A>, but no promoters of specific regulation have been described for this approach. A third approach is the randomization of spacer elements between transcription factor binding sites, which is applied to generate libraries of promoters of varying strength <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[9]</A>, <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[10]</A>.
<P>In order to be able to design synthetic promoters, an understanding of natural promoters is required. Mammalian promoters can be subdivided into several &quot;domains&quot;. The <I>core promoter</I> is the binding site of the basal transcription machinery, i.e. RNA polymerase and associated factors. Core promoters differ in composition, but are more or less similar for most genes (reviewed in <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[11]</A>). The main regulatory domain is the proximal promoter, which is where regulatory elements bind. It can be very large (4kb), meaning that some transcription factors regulate transcription despite being very far away from the RNA polymerase. This is mainly possible because of the three-dimensional structure the DNA adopts. In addition to this, there are even more distal elements that are referred to as &quot;enhancers&quot; and &quot;silencers&quot;. A further challenge is that some transcription factors are not able to initiate transcription on their own, but rather they require other transcription factors for their activity <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[5]</A>.

We modified Assembly PCR <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[12]</A> to create promoters with randomized spacing and frequency of Transcription Factor Binding Sites. It relies on using different oligos containing a transcription factor binding site (or random DNA) plus two annealing sequences (see Fig. 1 for a comprehensive explanation of the method).  We use two sets of oligos, one for the top strand, one for the bottom strand. The oligos for each strand have the same annealing sequences (which are complementary to the annealing sequences of the other strand). If these oligos are pooled, they will randomly anneal to each other, thus generating randomized repeats of the transcription factor binding sites of interest at varying spacing. In order to be able to clone the construct, we also add two stop oligos (termed stop 5' and top 3') which contain only one annealing sequence, plus a cutsite (SpeI 5', HindIII 3'). Double-stranded DNA is created by running a seven-cycle PCR, and amplified by a  25-cycle PCR. Then, the resulting (proximal) promoter is cloned 5' of a core promoter (we used the core promoter of JeT <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">[10]</A>) by inserting it into <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Measurement&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Measurement (page does not exist)">pSMB_MEASURE</A> (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K203100" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Part:BBa_K203100</A>), the promoter measurement plasmid we developed (from there, it can be excised like any standard biological part in a submission plasmid). Thus, a mixture of different promoters in the same plasmid backbone is generated. These can then be transformed into bacteria. Each colony represents a single putative promoter, which can be transfected into mammalian cell. 24 hours after transfection cells are exposed to the conditions of interest and control conditions, serving as a reference. Promoters active under the desired conditions, but not under control conditions, are selected for further characterization. </P><P>Please see a detailed protocol for RA-PCR <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Heidelberg/Project_Synthetic_promoters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Team:Heidelberg/Project Synthetic promoters (page does not exist)">below</A>.
