"Max_H": {     "Name" : "Max Horn",      "img" : "/wiki/images/a/a7/Heidelberg_MaxH.jpg",    "Description" : "'But after this has finished, I also want to do something in the wetlab', was one of the sentences most characterizing Max. He is definitely the software guy of the team. Compared to his programming, what we others coded was playing around with code blocks. For him it was always, the lower the level, the better. Therefore he is writing pure C code, as C++ does already too much by itself, he thinks. But still, he was somehow pressed to this role, as normally he is studying molecular biotechnology in 5th semester now. As iGEM@home was running, and he thought he would have a break from programming, the wiki as a project came upon him. On top, he is a perfectionist on software sides, so not only once he called out: 'Nils, look how smooth the ring is moving!'"  },  "Charlotte": {    "Name" : "Charlotte Bunne",     "img" : "/wiki/images/6/69/Heidelberg_Charlotte.jpg",    "Description" : "Charlotte is our youngest team member and already participated in iGEM in Germany´s first High School team in 2012. Studying Biosciences in her third semester, she impresses all team members with her energy, curiosity and ambition. She is the creative head behind nearly all artworks of our project. The wiki design originates from her imaginations and the BOINC video as well as the cover picture for our theme night “Religion and Synthetic Biology” arose from her hands. In team effort with Nils, she is conducting the linker screening experiments for the lysozyme circularization. In the course of these experiments Charlotte learned huge organisational skills that directs her abilities and energy into the right channels. In this way Charlotte became an indispensable team member."  },  "Nils": {    "Name": "Nils Klughammer",     "img" : "/wiki/images/f/ff/Heidelberg_Nils.jpg",    "Description" : "Nils will always be referred as the physicist in our team, because he implemented the whole CRAUT software and the lysozyme modelling. Furthermore he resigned to stand in the wet lab, and if just in full safety equipment – welling boots, helmet and welding goggles, was everything just to contaminated for him. Nils held the most motivation for circularisation, and were one oft he main leaders for ideas. Due to his structure, coordinate, and healthy life style, involvement in student parties he was very important in pulling the team together."  },  "Silvan": {    "Name": "Silvan Schmitz",    "img" : "/wiki/images/c/cf/Heidelberg_Silvan.jpg",    "Description" : "Silvan is studying Systems biology in his second year. Jakob said once: This guy has the genius talent to really understand programming languages, while everyone else is just typing some aligned codes. Silvan is the designer of our MidnightDoc, and the name was not only but to quite a large extend influenced by his favourite working hour."  },  "Jan": {    "Name": "Jan Gleixner",    "img" : "/wiki/images/d/dd/Heidelberg_Jan.jpg",    "Description" : "Jan – the internal instructor. He was the clever cloud above this whole project, gathering information from all subprojects and was therefore responsible for spreading the interdisciplinary work in the lab. Although sometimes hidden in his quite appearance, when you listen closer, you will get blown away by his extraordinary mind."  },  "Magdalena": {    "Name": "Magdalena Büscher",    "img" : "/wiki/images/f/f7/Heidelberg_Magdalena.jpg",    "Description" : "Magdalena (23) is studying in the second semester of the master program Molecular Biosciences with Major Cancer Biology. Together with Anna and Silvan, she worked on the circularization of mDNMT1 (731-1602) and the establishment of the methylation maintaining PCR2.0. Magdalena has been successfully contacting experts and organizing intein as well as the DNMT1 construct. Whenever external facilities had to be used for protein purification or mass spectroscopy, she knew who to contact."  },  "Carolin": {    "Name": "Carolin Schmelas",    "img" : "/wiki/images/4/49/Heidelberg_Carolin.jpg",    "Description" : "Caro is studying both biology with focus on neuroscience and Psychologies. When hearing her Whohoo exclamation, the whole team started to smile. It meant Caro was happy, because her CPEC cloning had worked, the split fluorescence protein gloomed, or she was deeply inLOV. For the youngest of us she was somehow the mummy oft he lab, sometimes demanding, sometimes treating, forgiving, sometimes the princess, always the winner."  },  "Elisabeth": {    "Name": "Elisabeth Schäfer",    "img" : "/wiki/images/7/71/Heidelberg_Elisabeth.jpg",    "Description" : "Elisabeth is a 3rd year bachelor student in Molecular Biotechnology, Philosophy and Jewish Studies. She designed and cloned huge parts of the toolbox, but also organized the theme evening on synthetic biology, ethics and religion. Outside the lab she enjoys literature, learning new languages and traveling."  },  "Jakob": {    "Name": "Jakob Kreft",    "img" : "/wiki/images/9/92/Heidelberg_Jakob.jpg",    "Description" : "Together with Charlotte and Anna he has participated in the iGEM team High school 2012. Now he is a medicine student in his second year. Synthetic Biology is one of his main interests and he hopes to continue working in this field of science. This summer he felt inLOV with inteins. Furthermore he was part of the wiki force."  },  "Max_W": {    "Name": "Max Waldhauer",    "img" : "/wiki/images/5/5a/Heidelberg_MaxW.jpg",    "Description" : "Max also called Captain Sharky,is a 3rd year student in Molecular Biotechnology. He was responsible for a huge load of cloning stuff and the expert when it comes to circularization. He is not only the most successfull team member when it comes to handling 40 minipreps at one time (NEVER mixing up samples), but also the most sporty one. Outside the lab he enjoys sports and learning Russian."  },  "Anna": {    "Name": "Anna Huhn",    "img" : "/wiki/images/c/c9/Heidelberg_Anna.jpg",    "Description" : "Anna is a 2nd year student in Molecular Biotechnology and the expert for DNMT1. She has been fascinated about this protein (and of course especially about its circularization) from beginning until the very end of the project: The last days before wikifreeze she eveb moved into the lab - bringing her tooth brush and  sleeping bag. Outside the lab she enjoys sailing on the Neckar in Heidelberg."  },  "Constantin": {    "Name": "Constantin Ahlmann-Eltze",     "img" : "/wiki/images/5/5a/Heidelberg_Constantin.jpg",    "Description" : "Constantin is a hybrid of programming and lab guy: Not only has iGEM@home been his idea and he could demonstrate his programming skills working on this project, but also he managed to circularize Xylanase – again his idea. In his free time he gives Java classes to high-school students. His secret talent: dancing."  },  "Julia": {    "Name": "Julia Neugebauer",    "img" : "/wiki/images/b/b6/Heidelberg_Julia.jpg",    "Description" : "I have done my bachelor and master studies in molecular biosciences at the University of Heidelberg. Currently, I am developing new confocal microscopy based screening methods using 3D cell culture. In the iGEM project, I was mainly involved  in the DNMT1 project and helped in the setup of the different assays to measure xylanase, lysozyme and DNMT1 activity."  },  "Joel": {    "Name": "Joel Beaudouin",    "img" : "/wiki/images/7/7f/Heidelberg_Joel.jpg",    "Description" : "I'm an experimentalist, originally physicist and now specialized in quantitative cell biology using imaging techniques. I've advised the students on the design of their experiments and on the techniques that have allowed them to quantitatively characterize their new proteins. I was also involved in the modeling parts of the project and their feedback to experimental data."  },  "Stefen": {    "Name": "Stephen Krämer",    "img" : "/wiki/images/c/c0/Heidelberg_Stefen.jpg",    "Description" : "Stephen has just finished his master studies in Molecular Biosciences in the major “Systems Biology” at the University of Heidelberg and is starting his PhD in the “Computational Oncology” group within the department of Prof. Roland Eils. He was part of the iGEM Team Heidelberg in 2008.

Being a stalwart iGEM enthusiast he never failed in finding himself trapped in the next iGEM experience. After rejoining the team of 2010, he graduated in Heidelberg and today  is a master student in molecular biotechnology with focuses on infectious disease and viral vectors for gene therapy. Now he's back to iGEM and looking forward to the giant jamboree. Besides iGEM, Philipp likes travelling between various scientific disciplines and arts and is member of a group of biohackers that develop low-cost lab equipment for schools and amateur biologists."  },  "Barbara": {    "Name": "Dr. Barbara Di Ventura",     "img" : "/wiki/images/c/c5/Heidelberg_Barbara_DiVentura.jpg",    "Description" : "Computer engineer by university training (carried out in the University of Rome “La Sapienza”), Barbara has done her Ph.D. in molecular biology in the laboratory of Luis Serrano, at the EMBL. Her Ph.D. project consisted in constructing a synthetic human p53 network in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. She was post-doc in the laboratory of Victor Sourjik, at the ZMBH. During this time she investigated the self-organizing properties of the Min system, the protein machinery that in Escherichia coli defines mid-cell. Since November 2011, Barbara heads the Synthetic Biology group in the department of Roland Eils, at the BioQuant. Barbara believes in the power of synthetic biology to create new functional devises and to teach important lessons about real biological systems. She also thinks that combining theory and experiments is the best strategy to understand the molecular mechanisms driving biological processes. Barbara finds the iGEM competition truly exciting and she is very happy to mentor the young, motivated and enthusiastic students of the Heidelberg iGEM 2014 team!"  },  "Eils": {    "Name": "Prof. Dr. Roland Eils",     "img" : "/wiki/images/1/19/Heidelberg_Roland_Eils.jpg",    "Description" : "Prof. Eils is again the head of the iGEM Heidelberg team. He provides the laboratories and all the required equipment. Besides, he will sponsor the traveling and participation costs. Thank you very much! The research interests of Prof. Eils lies in the field of the analysis and mathematical modeling of complex pathways in molecular biology. He can look back at a very successful career, as he is the head of the Department of Theoretical Bioinformatics in the DKFZ and working on computational oncology. Furthermore, he is the director of the Department of Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics of the IPMB at the University of Heidelberg. Alongside Prof. Kräusslich and Prof. Wolfrum, he is one of three founding directors of the BioQuant, as well as the leader of the Systems Biology Center and the representative of the FORSYS-Initiative of Heidelberg’s research network, the ViroQuant. He has won numerous awards; in particular he has been awarded the Biofuture price (approx. 1.2 Million €) by the BMBF for innovations allowing the graphical reconstruction of the eukaryotic mitosis process from 4D microscopy images and in the year 2005 he won the award for new innovative research by Helmholtz Society: “SystemsBiology of Complex Diseases”. Besides, he was one of the main organizers of the International Conference on Systems Biology in Heidelberg 2004 and he organized the German Symposium on Systems Biology 2009. His new engagement in the up-coming field of Synthetic Biology underlines the need for tight interdisciplinary work between experimentalists and theoreticians."  }
