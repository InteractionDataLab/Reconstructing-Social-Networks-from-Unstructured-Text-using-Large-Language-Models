MODELING
– Quantitative insights
LINKER MODELING
The design of linkers, which are essential for our intein-based circularization and assembly methods, is a complicated task. Here we employ structural modeling and statistical analyses to guide our linker experiments and their design.
ENZYME KINETICS MODELING
Based on over 1000 degradation curves of our circularized lysozyme variants, we tried to interpret the effect of linkers on protein thermostability. This was achieved by use of quantitative dynamical modeling.
