Ecological systems are constantly threatened with destruction due to human practices such as deforestation and excessive over cropping to create depleting supplies for the perfume production industry. This dilemma is what we aim to tackle in our project. By engineering E. coli to produce scent compounds that are hard to come across naturally, we aim to make perfume accessible for all in a sustainable manner. This synthetic biology approach can be used to create a database of scents that can be ordered to consumer demand. By using E. coli to generate these compounds, we aim to reduce the cost of these scents and improve yield in a more environmentally sustainable and less destructive manner. In summary, our BioBricks will be aimed at the production of a class of scent compounds called terpenoids, which will provide a proof of concept for future scent production..
