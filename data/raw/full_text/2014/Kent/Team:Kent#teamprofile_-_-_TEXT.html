The Kent team designed this project based on terpenoid synthase sequences reported in. We have also produced one novel biobrick that contained the terpenoid producing enzyme R-linalool synthase. We have also explored the roles and impact of Synthetic Biology in society by investigating its relationships with industry, political establishments and the general public. We engaged with British MPs by submitting a POST note about the use of Synthetic Biology to produce fragrance compounds. We developed interaction with industrial partner to devise a scale-up strategy that can be accepted by the public. Finally, we have assessed opinions of our project by collecting feedback from the public. We hope that the work we have done throughout our project will lead to future work to improve the use of synthetic biology in industry and have a positive impact on the environment. We would like to thank everyone above, the iGEM foundation, the University of Kent and our project supervisors who has made this project possible, as well as our sponsors, The University of Kent , The Biochemical Society, Society for general microbiology, Wellcome trust, BBSRC and Givaudan
