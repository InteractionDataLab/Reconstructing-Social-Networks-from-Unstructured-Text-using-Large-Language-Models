Team:Kent/meetups
From 2014.igem.org
Univeristy of Kent iGEM
 
 
Oxford
On the 19th of June two of our team members; Taylor and Alex travelled to Oxford University to attend an event hosted by Synox, the oxford university society of synthetic biology.  At the event were a number of other Brittish iGEM teams and synthetic biologists.   The event consisted of a number of talks from alumni and businesses including a talk from the president of iGEM Randy Rettberg, were he spoke about the history and mission of iGEM.  There was a poster session in the afternoon that  gave the opportunity to meet other iGEM teams and find out about their project idea and share our experiences to far with out own project.
 
YSB 2.0
During the 1st and 2nd of September the University of Kent iGem team were invited to a conference in London, a gathering of iGem teams representing their universities at the young synthetic biologists meet. During this day we met and socialised with the other teams, setting up collaborations and presenting our projects to each other. There was time after our presentations for questions and answers and from this we were able to see what other people thought of our project and gain feedback on areas that could be improved or, that people enjoyed.
After the poster session there was a break, which gave us time to interact with other teams, this was helpful as we were able to exchange our queries and ideas, some teams were even working on similar parts to us and so were able to give advice on how to use the parts efficiently. Our hosts for the day, University College London also organised workshops that enabled us all to work on different areas of our project, these included sessions on public engagement and a bioinformatics workshop. The sessions were extremely useful and we were able to apply them to our projects to make improvements and enhance the scope of our project.
In the afternoon there was a poster presentation and Team Kent received a substantial amount of positive feedback, which reassured us that our project may actually be a viable alternative for the public. We took on board the concerns and issues that other team members raised to us and took these back home with us to ensure our project was as good as it could be.
Overall Kent iGem team had a brilliant day at YSB 2.0, we would like to thank University College London and the Wellcome Trust for hosting us and in particular Phillip Boeing for organising such a successful day.
 
Medway Research Festival
On Wednesday the 10th of September our iGEM team attended the 2nd annual Medway research festival. This event was hosted on the Medway campus; this is a university space that is occupied by three universities, the University of Kent, University of Greenwich and Canterbury Christ Church University. The event now in its second year, is an opportunity for staff, postgraduate students and people from industry to meet each other in a informal setting to present posters, stalls and demonstrations relating to each of their respective research topics. At the festival, we had our own table, were we put up the poster that we took to YSB 2.0 describing the aims, goals and background of our project. Throughout the day we took the opportunity to speak to people within the scientific field, getting them to take part in our questionnaire and impact of our project on society activity.  This activity involved the individual first being informed of the project, from the scale at which we were working, to the bigger and idea of the project.  We then asked them to write on a post-it note the best possible outcome of our project, the worst possible outcome of our project and then what communication problems if any they had in getting their research through to the public and politicians. As the day went on we gained valuable insight into the opinions of our projects from scientists and academics, things we had not considered ourselves. The results of the surveys and the activities can be found in our human practices pages.  Throughout the day we also took the opportunity to view posters and talks from the others at the event.  Overall the day not only gave us valuable feedback on our project but we were able to gain an insight into real academic study.
Sheffield
The Sheffield iGEM team held a UK iGEM meet up at Sheffield university.  It gave iGEM teams from across the UK a chance to meet together and talk about each other's projects and give feedback on what they thought.  Each team had to prepare and present a 2 minute presentation about their project and provide a poster for a poster session in the afternoon.   The meet up was a great way to interact with other teams and get a chance to see their work.
