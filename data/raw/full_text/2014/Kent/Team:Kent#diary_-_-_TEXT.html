Week 1
Day 1 (25/06/14): 
After a meeting with our advisors yesterday, we came into the lab this morning and began learning how to prepare competent cells.  
We prepared: 
100mM CaCl2 – autoclaved 
100mM CaCl2 + 30% v/v glycerol – autoclaved 
100ml LB media (1g Tryptone, 0.5g Yeast extract, 1g Sodium Chloride) - autoclaved 
 
E.coli was added to 5ml of LB and incubated overnight at 37° 
Pipette tips, conical flasks, bottles etc were also autoclaved ready for tomorrow 
Also discussed possible project ideas and booked a room in the library to discuss theses as a group tomorrow.  
 
Day 2 (26/06/14): 
Today we carried on with the preparation of the competent cells. 
E.coli that had been incubating overnight was inoculated into LB and grown at 37°C until the OD600 reached 0.4. Cells were then cooled in the cold room and then centrifuged at 3000rpm, 4°C for 8mins. Pellet was resuspended in 100mM CaCl2, incubated on ice and centrifuged again. Pellet was again resuspended in 100mM CaCl2, 30% v/v glycerol and divided into 33 x 100µl in eppendorfs and stored at -80°C.  
We began to prepare 100ml of LB agar (1g Tryptone,   0.5g Yeast extract, 1g Sodium Chloride, 2g agar), this was autoclaved   but we then discovered we had no Chloramphenicol so could not continue   preparing the plates.  
We also spent a few hours discussing parts and looking through the registry, and discussing different ideas. 
 
Day 3 (27/06/14): 
Today we carried out the transformation of our competent E.coli cells.  
Firstly we prepared 500ml of LB agar (5g Tryptone, 2.5g Yeast extract, 5g Sodium chloride, 10g agar) and autoclaved. Once this had cooled we added 0.5ml (1:1000 dilution) of chloramphenicol and made the plates. These were then allowed to set.  
We then carried out the transformation by thawing four eppendorfs of our competent cells on ice. 2µl of resuspended DNA (GFP open reading frame), was added to the competent cells, and 1µl of RFP control was added to the control competent cells. Cells they were incubated on ice for 30mins and were then heat shocked in a 42°C water bath for 60s and place back on ice for 5mins. 1ml of LB media was added to the cells and they were then incubated at   37°C for 2 hours. 50 and 100µl of the cells were plated on the LB agar   with chloramphenicol we had prepared and left to grow at room   temperature over the weekend. 
 
Week 2
Day 4 (30/06/14): 
Over   the weekend our plates had been growing, both plates of GFP transformed   cells showed many colonies of E.coli. The two control plates both only   had a few colonies and their morphology was very different to the   colonies on the other plates. We therefore repeated the control plates.  
We   picked a single colony from each plate we had grown and inoculated them   in glycerol stock and left them overnight to grow ready to carry out   the miniprep tomorrow.  
 
Day 5 (01/07/14): 
This   morning we centrifuged our inoculated cells but no pellet was produced.   We found out this is because they should not have been inoculated in   glycerol stock. We therefore took two more colonies from the 100µl   plates and inoculated them in LB and left to grow overnight.  
As   we had no growth on our repeated control plates we also repeated the   transformation, using RFP for the controls and YFP for the non-controls.   These were left to incubate overnight at 37°C.  
In   the afternoon we had a meeting with Mark Shepherd, to discuss ideas. By   the end of the meeting we had decided to further research into the production of esters in E.coli, but also to carry on researching into BMCs.  
 
Day 6 (02/07/14): 
We   took two colonies from the 100µl plates of cells containing YFP and   inoculated them in LB media. These were left to grow overnight.  
We   centrifuged the cells transformed with GFP that had been inoculated in   LB media overnight. Using the pellet of cells produced we followed the   miniprep protocol to obtain the plasmid DNA.  
 
Day 7 (03/07/14): 
This morning we met to discuss ideas for the project. After the meeting with Mark Shepherd we had spent the last few days researching the idea of targeting   antimicrobial peptides to BMCs to deliver them to the gut and for   treatment of gastroenteritis/other conditions, or alternatively using   E.coli to produce fragrances. We discussed the pros and cons of each   project and collectively decided to further research into using the   production of fragrances in E.coli as an environmentally friendly   alternative to their current industrial production.  
Week 3
Day 8 (07/07/14): 
Today   we met in the library to decide on which genes we wanted to try and   insert into plasmids. We decided upon S-linalool synthase, R-linalool   synthase, E-E-germacrene-B synthase, patchoulol synthase, R-limonene   synthase, zingiberne synthase and geraniol synthase. We found the   sequences for these and also began looking at what promoters and   terminators we could use. We also began looking at using light to   activate the synthesis of these genes.  
 
Day 9 (08/07/14): 
Today   Taylor and Matt used the transformation efficiency kit to test the   efficiency of the competent cells we had made. These were plated and   left overnight to grow. 
We   also had a meeting with Wei-Feng, and discussed the lab work we have   carried out so far, the enzymes we have selected to try and put into   plasmids, and the best methods to do this. Wei-Feng suggested using   Gibson assembly to do this. Wei-Feng also suggested disregarding any sequences that had been used in iGem before, as we would not be creating new biobricks with them.  
 
Day 10 (09/07/14): 
This   morning we discovered that due to an error in carrying out the   transformation efficiency yesterday, cells had not grown on the plates.  
We also began designing primers for the sequences that we have chosen, and discussed using Gibson assembly as opposed to using the Biobrick method and what promoters to use.  
 
Day 11 (10/07/14): 
Today we narrowed down what sequences   we wanted to insert into plasmids to germacrene-b synthase, patchoulol   synthase, R-linalool synthase and zingiberne synthase. We started to   look at removing restriction sites from these sequences and optimizing   the sequences for expression in E.coli.  
Matt and Claire also carried out again the transformation efficiency kit as it had not worked yesterday.  
 
Day 12 (11/07/14): 
This morning we found again that the transformation efficiency had not worked as no colonies had grown on the plates.  
Ellie completed the optimization of the sequences with removal of restriction sites, and addition of prefixes and suffixes.
Week 4
Day 13 (14/07/14): 
Today   we repeated the transformation efficiency protocol again with cells   that we knew were definitely competent, to see if the problem was with   the cells we were using or with our carrying out of the protocol. These   were left to incubate overnight at 37°C.  
We   also carried on working on our sequences, and started looking into how   much it will cost to order our sequence. As our sequences are quite long   we looked into whether it will be cheaper to order the sequences in   parts or as one long sequence.  
As   a group we discussed ideas for the wiki, and Taylor and Alex carried on   working on this. Claire designed a poster for Alex and Ellie to take to   Sheffield on Friday.  
 
Day 14 (15/07/14): 
When we took the transformation efficiency plates out of the freezer this morning we found that once   again we had no colonies. We discussed reasons for this, and prepared   an agarose gel to check that the plasmid was present in the DNA samples   we are using. 
We also prepared a number of agar plates and agar plates with Chloramphenicol. 
Taylor   and Alex carried on working on the wiki, using the idea of a   minimalistic design that we had agreed upon. We also decided that we   like the logo that Rosie has designed, but that it needs some   changes/improvements.  
We   met with our supervisors, and discussed sequences, lab work, the wiki   and future events. We decided that due to the budget we will initially   only order one sequence. We decided as a team that zingiberne synthase   would be the enzyme we would like to use first.   
 
Day 15 (16/07/14): 
We carried out agarose gel electrophoresis on the GFP plasmids we had obtained in the miniprep.   However due to an error in the preparation of the gel this was   unsuccessful. We also left a sample of E.coli cells in freshly prepared   LB at 37°C over night to grow. 
Taylor   carried on working on the Wiki, and Rosie and Alex carried on working   on the logo. We also filled out the iGem safety forms and a proposal for   a workshop we could hold at the YSB conference in September.  
As   a group we discussed whether or not to use the enzyme patchoulol   synthase as we have found out that the current production of patchouli   oil is done is quite a sustainable way. We   decided that using patchoulol synthase probably isn’t the best idea and   to look into alternative enzymes we could use instead.  
 
Day 16 (17/07/14): 
Today   we completed the poster and presentation for the Sheffield meet up. We   also carried on working on the logo design, adding in some of the iGem   colours.  
The   zingiberne synthase sequence was finalised and sent to Wei-Feng to be   ordered, and we design the Biobrick we will make with this sequence,   including the promoter, ribosome binding site and terminator. 
In   the lab Brogan and Rosie prepared some more competent cells, and also   carried out agarose gel electrophoresis of the plasmid we obtained from   the mini-prep, to check the plasmid was present. Unfortunately when   viewed under UV, only the DNA marker was present, showing the plasmid   was not present in the sample. 
Week 5
Day 17 (21/07/14): 
Today   we took a colony of GFP transformed cells and inoculated them in LB   media. These were left to grow overnight at 37°C ready to be used in the   miniprep   procedure tomorrow. We also transformed the new competent cells we had   made with YFP, and left these to grow overnight also at 37°C on   chloramphenicol agar plates. An agarose gel was also prepared ready to   carry agarose gel electrophoresis tomorrow with the plasmid we hope to   obtain from the miniprep, to check the plasmid is present.  
We finalised the zingiberne synthase and alpha-farnesene sequences, so that they could be ordered and we can then begin to assemble our Biobrick.  
 
Day 18 (22/07/14): 
Today we carried out the miniprep   of the GFP transformed cells that had been growing overnight to obtain   the GFP plasmid from them. This plasmid was the run on the agarose gel   we had prepared yesterday. Unfortunately whilst running this gel began to melt. We also used spectrometry to determine the concentration of plasmid we had obtained, and we had a high concentration. 
We   also sent emails to five different local and national newspapers to   begin trying to spread the word about synthetic biology. We also emailed   an iGem team from Paris and Sheffield iGem about collaborations.  
We also met with our supervisors and discussed the ordering of sequences, Boston trip, outreach and other iGem events. 
Ellie, Claire and Lisa developed sequences for R-linalool synthase and Patchoulol synthase.  
Day 19 (23/07/14): 
Today our sequence for zingiberne synthase was ordered. It will hopefully arrive in eight days. We confirmed the sequences for patchoulol synthase and R-linalool synthase, and found parts in the repository that we need to order.  
Taylor   carried on developing the wiki, creating a ‘landing page’ that people   will see when they look at our site until it is completed. 
Brogan and Rosie found quotes for hotels and flights for Boston, and also emailed newspapers and planned outreach. 
 
Day 20 (24/07/14): 
This   morning we decided upon a constitutive promoter, a ribosome binding   site and a terminator that we wanted to transform. This is so we will   have these ready when our sequence for zingiberne synthase arrives. We also decided to transform limonene synthase (from the iGem kit), so we can practice doing the restriction digests and ligations.  
We   prepared chloramphenicol of the correct concentration, and then   prepared agar plates with chloramphenicol to grow our transformed cells   on.  
We then carried out the four transformations, using   parts BBa_J23108 (promoter), BBa_J1742111 (limonene synthase),   BBa_B0015 (terminator) and BBa_B0030 (RBS) from the plates in our kit.   We  plated each transformation twice and left to incubate overnight at 37°C. 
 
Day 21 (25/07/14): 
This morning we counted the plates of transformed cells that we had been growing overnight. 
BBa_J23108: 0 colonies, 0 colonies 
BBa_B0030: 0 colonies, 1 colony 
BBa_J1742111: 8 colonies, 7 colonies 
BBa_B0015: 2 colonies, 8 colonies 
As there was no real growth for the promoter or RBS we will retransform these next week. We will miniprep the limonene synthase and terminator transformations next week as well.
 
Week 6
Day 22 (28/07/2014): 
Today   we found a new constitutive promoter and ribosome binding site to   transform. These are parts BBa_J23109 (promoter) and BBa_B0032 (RBS). These were transformed, plated, and left to grow overnight at 37°C.  
We selected a colony of the E.coli transformed with part BBa_1742111   (limonene synthase) and part BBa_B0015 (terminator) and inoculated   these in LB. These were also left at 37°C overnight to grow ready to   carry out the miniprep tomorrow. 
 
Day 23 (29/07/14): 
Today   we found that colonies had grown on the plates transformed with part   BBa_B0032 (RBS) yesterday, but no colonies on the plates transformed   with part BBa_J23109.  
A colony of BBa_B0032 (RBS) transformed E.coli cells was inoculated in LB media and left to grow overnight at 37°C. 
We   selected another new constitutive promoter, part BBa_J23119 and carried   out the transformation of this, as well as retransforming part   BBa_J23109. These were both plated and left at 37°C overnight to grow. 
We carried out a miniprep of part BBa_1742111   (limonene synthase) transformed cells and part BBa_B0015 (terminator)   transformed cells that had been grown up overnight. The plasmid obtained   from these was stored at -20°C. 
We   also had a meeting with Wei-Feng and Luca, in which we discussed the   planning of Boston and YSB 2.0, our ordered sequence and general lab   work.  
We also skyped Paris Bettencourt and discussed a possible collaboration between the teams. 
 
Day 24 (30/07/14): 
We   had a lot of growth of both promoters, parts BBa_J23109 and BBa_J23119,   however we realised this is as they had been grown on plates with no   chloramphenicol and therefore transformed colonies had not been selected   for. We therefore transformed both of these parts again, plated these   and left them to grow overnight at 37°C.  
We had been growing up overnight E.coli cells transformed with part BBa_B0032 (RBS). We carried out a miniprep of these and collected the plasmid.  
Plasmid obtained from the minipreps of the E.coli cells transformed with parts BBa_1742111   (limonene synthase), BBa_B0015 (terminator) and BBa_B0032 (RBS), was   then ran on an agarose gel to check if the plasmid is present. All three plasmids were present.  
 
Day 25 (31/07/14): 
Colonies of E.coli transformed with parts BBa_J23109 and BBa_J23119 had both grown overnight. Colonies were selected and inoculated into 5ml of LB to grow at 37°C overnight. 
We   performed a single restriction digest of limonene synthase plasmid   using the enzyme EcoR1, another single restriction digest using the   enzyme Pst1, and a double restriction digest using both enzymes. The   fragments obtained from these digests were then run on an agarose gel. However, these digests did not work. 
 
Day 26 (01/07/14): 
E.coli transformed with the promoter parts BBa_J23109 and BBa_J23119 that had been grown up overnight were minipreped, and the plasmid obtained from each stored at -20°C.  
As   yesterday’s digest of limonene synthase had not gone correctly, this   was repeated today. Limonene synthase gene in the plasmid backbone   psb1C3 was digested singly with EcoR1 and Pst1, and doubly with both   enzymes. This was then run on the gel again and the correct parts had been obtained, although there had been a problem with the gel so this will be repeated on Monday.  
Taylor and Alex have also carried on designing and coding the wiki. 
Week 7
Day 27 (04/08/14): 
We   carried out a restriction digest using just EcoR1, just Pst1 and using   both enzymes on parts BBa_J23109 (promoter), BBa_J23119 (promoter),   BBa_B0032 (RBS), BBa_174211 (limonene synthase), and BBa_B0015   (terminator).  
We   than ran the digests on agarose gels to check the correct size parts   had been obtained. Due to running out of time the gels were not able to   be left running long enough and therefore when imaged the bands had not   separated. We will therefore repeat this work tomorrow. 
 
Day 28 (05/08/14): 
We   carried out a restriction digest using just EcoR1, just Pst1 and using   both enzymes on parts BBa_J23109 (promoter), BBa_J23119 (promoter),   BBa_B0032 (RBS), BBa_174211 (limonene synthase), and BBa_B0015   (terminator).  
We   then ran the digests on agarose gels to check the correct size parts   had been obtained. These all showed the expected bands so the   restriction digest had worked.  
We   also had a meeting with our supervisors in which we discussed upcoming   deadlines, London YSB 2.0 planning, Boston travel, outreach and   collaborations and lab work.  
Taylor carried on working on the wiki, creating the template design that the information will then be loaded onto. 
 
Day 29 (06/08/14): 
Today we prepared two agarose gels that we can run a digested limonene synthase plasmid on tomorrow. 
We carried out a transformation of parts BBa_174211 (limonene synthase) and BBa_B0015   (terminator), into competent E.coli cells. We also revitalised our   colonies BBa_J23109 (promoter), BBa_J23119 (promoter) and BBa_B0032   (RBS) transformed cells be replating them.  
We   also compiled an inventory of all of the cells, plasmids, enzymes etc.   that we have in stock, so that we can make/order more before we run   out.  
Taylor also uploaded our wiki template so we can start to upload information onto it. 
A   double restriction digest of limonene synthase plasmids was carried out   using the enzymes EcoR1 and Pst1. These were left to incubate overnight   at room temperature. 
 
Day 30 (07/08/14): 
The digested limonene synthase plasmid was ran on two agarose gels to separate the psb1C3 backbone from the limonene   synthase part. The bands were then visualised and cut out of the gel. A   DNA gel extraction kit was used to extract the DNA from the gel. This   DNA was then stored at -20°C. 
We inoculated cells transformed yesterday with parts  BBa_J23109 (promoter), BBa_J23119 (promoter), BBa_B0032 (RBS), BBa_174211 (limonene synthase) and BBa_B0015 (terminator) in LB and left overnight at 37°C.
Week 8
Day 32 (11/08/14): 
Double digest run on all parts, left overnight for gels. Gels were also prepared. 
Day 33 (12/08/14): 
All parts were run on gels, gels were then extracted and frozen. This gave us a bulk store for assembly. 
Day 34 (13/08/14): 
Pcr for limonene synthase, gel run to check if the pcr had worked, pcr purification run so we have more of our plasmid for assembly. 
Day 35 (14/08/14): 
Pcr gel rerun as there was a fault with the gel, pcr purification and double digest on the limonene synthase ready for ligation back into the plasmid backbone. 
Day 36 (15/08/14): 
Double digest of the limonene synthase backbone, gel run of the double digest and gel extraction. 
Week 9
Day 37 (18/08/14): 
Ligation of limonene synthase and backbone, transformation of ligated product, run a gel of ligation. 
 
Day 38 (19/08/14): 
 
Today   we had a meeting with our supervisors. We discussed arrangements for   YSB 2.0, Boston and also our progress in the lab. We discussed how we   can continue being productive in the lab until our genes arrive. 
 
Day 39 (20/08/14): 
 
Today   we digested parts BBa_J23109 and BBa_J23119 to remove them from the   psb1C3 backbone with chloramphenicol resistance. These were then ligated   into a plasmid backbone with tetracycline resistance. 
Limonene synthase vector with RBS was ligated onto a backbone with ampicillin resistance. 
Plasmids of both promoters (BBa_J23109 and BBa_J23119) and limonene synthase (BBa_I742111) were transformed into E.coli cells and left to grow overnight at 37°C. 
Chloramphenicol, ampicillin and tetracycline plates were made. 
 
Day 40 (21/08/14): 
 
Yesterday’s   transformations of limonene synthase and promoters J23109 and J23119   were unsuccessful as we had no colonies on any of the plates.  
Digestions   were again carried out of limonene synthase with RBS (BBa_I742111) and   both promoters (BBa_J23109 and BBa_J23119). Ligations were then carried   out of limonene synthase onto an ampicillin resistant backbone and both   promoters onto a tetracycline resistant backbone. Transformations were   carried out of each part into E.coli. These were plated and left   overnight at 37°C.  
Ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol agar plates were made.  
A PCR reaction was set up and left to run overnight to amplify a digested promoter. 
 
Day 41 (22/08/14): 
Yesterday’s transformations of limonene synthase and promoters J23109 and J23119 were again unsuccessful as we had no colonies on any of the plates.  
Ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol agar plates were made. 
Transformations of the following were carried out: 
-limonene synthase with RBS on an ampicillin resistant backbone,  
-promoters J23109 and J23119 on a tetracycline resistant backbone, 
-promoters J23109 and J23119 on a chloramphenicol resistant backbone,  
-RBS on a chloramphenicol resistant backbone,  
-a light inducible promoter on a chloramphenicol resistant backbone, 
-A backbone 
These were plated on the appropriate agar plates and left to grow over the weekend at room temperature. 
The PCR product was purified and ran on an agarose gel. However when visualised under UV no promoter could be seen on the gel. It is possible the promoter was lost during purification due to its small size. 
Our gene R-linalool synthase arrived! This was amplified using PCR. 
 
Week 10
Day 42 (26/08/14):
We had a number of successful transformations from Friday. We had colonies of promoter J23109 on a tetracycline resistant backbone, promoter J23119 on a chloramphenicol resistant backbone, RBS on a chloramphenicol resistant backbone and limonene synthase on an ampicillin resistant backbone. Colonies of these were selected and inoculated in LB to grow up overnight to be minipreped tomorrow.
We also inoculated a sample of untransformed E.coli into LB and left to grow up overnight ready to make competent tomorrow.
We ran an agarose gel to check that the PCR of R-linalool had been successful. Bands were seen so it had been.
We also carried out another transformation of the blue light promoter.
 
Day 43 (27/08/14):
We carried out a PCR reaction of R-linalool and then ran this on a gel. When ran on a gel there were no bands for R-linalool showing this had been unsuccessful.
We carried out the miniprep of both promoters, J23109 and J23119, limonene synthase and RBS.
We prepared competent cells using the cells that had been grown up overnight.
We also carried out a Gibson assembly reaction to insert R-linalool into a chloramphenicol backbone. These were transformed into E.coli, plated on chloramphenicol agar and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
 
Day 44 (28/08/14):
The transformation of R-linalool in a chloramphenicol backbone had been successful, with colonies having grown. Colonies were selected and grown up in LB containing chloramphenicol. Colonies were also replated.
Plasmid of limonene synthase on an ampicillin backbone was digested using EcoR1 and Pst1, and ran on a gel to check we had the correct product. This was successful as the correct bands were obtained.
Promoters J23109 and J23119 were digested and ligated into a tetracycline resistant backbone. These were plated on agar and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
 
Day 45 (29/08/14):
The ligation of promoters J23109 and J23119 onto a tetracycline backbone was unsuccessful, and therefore we carried out a digestion of J23119 again. We then re-ligated it into tetracycline and left to grow overnight again at 37°C.
The minipreped R-linalool plasmid was digested, and the fragments ran on an agarose gel to check if the correct fragments had been obtained. This was successful so we now have a BioBrick with R-linalool inserted.
We also carried out a transformation efficiency test on the competent cells we prepared on Wednesday.
 
Week 11
Day 46 (1/09/14):
London YSB 2.0
 
Day 47 (2/09/14):
Rosie and Lisa at London YSB 2.0.
We carried out double digests of limonene synthase, promoter J23119, TET backbone.
We carried out a ligation of promoter J23119 with limonene synthase onto a tetracycline backbone. These were transformed into E.coli and grown on agar overnight at 37°C.
We transformed a promoter + RBS part on a chloramphenicol backbone into E.coli, and grew these up overnight at 37°C.
 
Day 48 (3/09/14):
Today we carried out double digests of limonene synthase on an ampicillin backbone, R-linalool on a chloramphenicol backbone, promoter J23119 on a chloramphenicol backbone, TET and AMP backbones.
Limonene synthase was ligated to promoter J23119 and onto a tetracycline resistant backbone, using 3A assembly. This was transformed into E.coli, spread on agar plates and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
R-linalool was ligated onto a ampicillin resistant backbone, transformed into E.coli, spread on agar plates and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
Colonies that had been transformed with promoter and RBS were inoculated in LB and grown up overnight at 37°C.
E.coli was transformed with a blue light promoter and also with RFP on a tetracycline resistant backbone. These were plated on agar and left to grow overnight at 37°C
 
Day 49 (4/09/14):
We had colonies grown of the assembly of promoter J23119 with limonene synthase onto a TET backbone, and of the light promoter. We had a lawn of colonies of R-linalool onto ampicillin suggesting this had been contaminated. We had no growth of RFP on a TET backbone.
Colonies of the limonene synthase assembly and of the light promoter were selected and inoculated in LB. These were left to grow overnight at 37°C.
E.coli that had been transformed with promoter and RBS and grown up overnight were miniprepped, and the plasmid stored at -20°C.
 
Day 50 (5/09/14):
A double digest of R-linalool on a chloramphenicol backbone was carried out, and R-linalool was ligated onto an ampicillin resistant backbone. This was then transformed into E.coli, plated on ampicillin agar plates and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
R-linalool was also assembled onto a kanamycin resistant backbone using Gibson assembly.
E.coli that had been transformed with the limonene synthase assembly and with the light promoter and grown up overnight were miniprepped, and the plasmid obtained stored at -20°C.
 
Day 51 (7/09/14):
Colonies of E.coli transformed with R-linalool on an ampicillin resistant backbone were selected, and inoculated in LB. These were left to grow up overnight at 37°C.
 
Week 12
Day 52 (8/09/14):
We carried out a miniprep of E.coli that had been transformed with R-linalool on an ampicillin backbone to obtain the plasmid.
We then carried out a double digest using EcoR1 and Pst1 of the limonene synthase assembly and R-linalool on an ampicillin resistant backbone. These were run on agarose gels to check we had the correct assemblies. The gels showed that the digests had not worked correctly.
We also carried out a PCR reaction of the tetracycline and ampicillin resistant backbones to amplify the amount we had.
E.coli cells were inoculated in LB and grown up overnight to be made competent tomorrow.
We met with Lee to discuss human practices and the Medway Research Festival. We designed a questionnaire, and discussed the presentation we would give.
 
Day 53 (9/09/14):
Today we prepared another batch of competent cells.
We carried out a PCR purification of the plasmid backbones, Amp, Tet, Cam and Kan that had been amplified yesterday.
We also had a meeting with Wei-Feng, who suggested testing the enzymes we were using to ensure they are functioning properly.
 
Day 54 (10/09/14):
Today we attended the Medway research festival. We hosted a stall and presented our poster to many other scientists, researchers from a number of disciplines and members of the public. We also gathered responses to the survey we created. From other people at the festival we gathered ideas about the best and worst case scenarios of our project, and barriers that prevent scientists interacting with MPs and scientific policy makers.
 
Day 55 (11/09/14):
E.coli were transformed with RFP plasmid on backbones with AMP, TET, CAM and KAN resistance. This were plated on the appropriate agar and grown up overnight at 37°C.
To test the functioning of the enzymes we ran a series of digests of the limonene synthase plasmid on a gel. These were single digest with EcoR1, single digest with Pst1 and double digests with EcoR1 and Pst1. These showed that the EcoR1 enzyme was not functioning.
 
Day 56 (12/09/14):
Our zingiberne synthase gene finally arrived today! As we had ordered this gene in a plasmid we carried out a double digest using EcoR1 and Pst1 and ran these on an agarose gel to check the digest had worked and that we had the correct part. This worked so we are now able to start the assembly of the zingiberne synthase BioBrick.
We also moved out of the teaching labs where we have been working and into a research lab in preparation for the start of term.
 
Week 13
Day 57 (15/09/14):
Today we carried out double digests of Limonene synthase, promoter J23119, R-linalool and TET backbone.
We carried out 3A assembly of promoter and limonene synthase onto a TET backbone. These were transformed into E.coli, plated and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
R-linalool was assembled onto an AMP backbone using Gibson assembly. These were transformed into E.coli, plated and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
 
Day 58 (16/09/14):
We had no growth of the limonene synthase assembly, but we did have colonies of growth of R-linalool on the ampicillin resistant backbone. Colonies of R-linalool were selected, inoculated in LB media and respreads on fresh plates and left to grow overnight at 37°C.
To check if the limonene synthase gene had assembled with the promoter and just not transformed we ran the assembly product on an agarose gel. When we viewed the gel there was no DNA present.
We also made fresh agar plates containing ampicillin and tetracycline.
Zingiberne synthase and tetracycline backbone were both digested ready to carry out a Gibson assembly.
 
Day 60 (18/09/14):
Promoter + RBS and R-linalool on a CAM resistant backbone that had been grown up overnight were miniprepped. We carried out a double digest on the miniprep material and ran these on a gel to ensure the correct parts had been obtained.
 
Day 61 (19/09/14):
We carried out 3A assembly of promoter + RBS onto R-linalool and promoter onto limonene synthase. These were plated on agar and left at 37°C overnight to grow.
We also used PCR to amplify the amount of the three antibiotic resistant backbones we are using.
