These compounds particularly in plants give off scents when produced and we hope to improve on the yield that is obtained during current chemical production techniques. 
          Terpenoids are characteristic molecules that derive from the condensation of 5-carbon isoprene units. They play major roles in plants such as growth regulation, signalling, and defense mechanisms.  Additionally terpenoids have a characteristic aroma. 
        There are two metabolic pathways used to synthesize terpenoids: the mevalonate pathway in plants and the non mevalonate pathway in <I>E.coli</I>l (fig1). Both pathways ultimately lead to compounds: Isopentanyl pyrophosphate and dimethyl Isoprenyl pyrophosphate which are further converted into geranyl pyrophosphate farnesyl pyrophosphate to synthesize terpenes.</DIV></TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD><P align="justify"><EM>Fig1. Mevalonate and Non-Mevalonate pathway. two pathways from different organisms </EM>
          Due to these molecules possessing fragrance qualities, they are used in industry for the production of perfumes, cosmetics, household products, etc. 
        Our project focuses on the synthesis of selected terpene fragrant compounds: zingiberene, R-linalool and limonene, by expressing each enzyme in <I>E.coli.</I></P><P align="justify"><STRONG>Limonene synthase:</STRONG>
          Limonene is a scented cyclic terpene, from the hydrocarbon family. The major fragrance it is associated with is lemons, citrus fruits have large amounts of the compound and it is known to give off the scent associated with the fruits. Usually limonene is harvested from fruits using steam distillation or centrifugal separation, steam distillation yields around 1%, this is far greater than other distillation techniques which can yield as low as 0.1%. 
          Limonene is a very common ingredient in cosmetic products, often found in shampoos, lotions, perfumes and other everyday items. The demand for it is huge; as the yield is so small farming products is very wasteful. <STRONG>Zingiberene Synthase: </STRONG>
        Zingiberene synthase is an enzyme found in ginger rhizomes (Zingiber officinale). It converts farnesyl diphosphate into zingiberene and diphosphate in a single enzymatic reaction. Zingiberene (C15H24)  is classified as a sesquiterpene -  a terpene that is characterized by the presence of 15 carbon atoms. It is a consitutient of the ginger oil that is extracted from rhizomes (roots) and is responsible for the pleasant ginger aroma of the plant.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD><P align="justify"><STRONG>Use of zingiberene: </STRONG>
          Zingiberene contributes to the scents in many commercial perfumes. This is achieved via steam distillation of the ginger rhizomes. These contain approximately 1-3% of the essential fragrant oil, where the major component is zingiberene (34%). 
Additionally it also possesses medicinal properties which can be further researched such as anti – inflammatory and anti-cancer.</P><P align="justify"><STRONG>R-linalool Synthase: </STRONG>
        R-linalool is classified as a terpenoid that is found in the essential oil of the Lavandula family that contributes to the lavender scent. It is synthesized by the enzyme R-linalool synthase using Geranyl diphosphate and water as substrates, producing R-linalool and Diphosphate as products (fig2). Lavender is a scent that is employed by the fragrance industry: e.g. soaps, skin lotions, cleaning products, perfumes and other products.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD><P align="justify"><STRONG>Production:</STRONG>
          There are different methods to manufacture R-Linalool. 
          Fractional distilliation of the essential oil from plants such as Bois de rose (rosewood), shiu or coriander. 
          The major sources of R- Linalool are Brazilian rosewood, Chinese and Taiwanese Ho leaf. In for example Freesia, the R-linalool exists as the R-(-) enantiomer only. The chemical synthesis of R-Linalool involves reactants: acetylene and acetone or isoprene hydrochloride. 
          In the year 2000, approximately 12,000 tonnes of Linalool was produced out of which more than half was synthesized chemically. <STRONG>Other properties of R-Linalool:</STRONG>
        Many researchers have studied the physiological effects of these odours such as sleep, aggressiveness, muscle tension, etc. Experiments conducted by Hardy et al suggested that R-linalool has a significant sedating effect. This is because it is considered that terpenes have the ability to potentiate the GABAA receptor activity in particular regions of the brain.</P><P align="justify"> </P><P align="justify"> </P><P align="justify"><STRONG>References:</STRONG>
