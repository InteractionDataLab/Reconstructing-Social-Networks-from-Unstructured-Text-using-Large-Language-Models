Conclusions and Future Work
Project
Short Term Goals
We plan continue collecting data on the systems we have now.
Long Term Goals: Inducible Probiotic
We envision our solution being deployed as a probiotic, to be taken prophylactically once. When the patient is suspected of a potential cholera infection, the system can be induced with a simple, readily available chemical. When the therapy is complete, the system will be 'switched off' using the simple kill switch we've characterized.
