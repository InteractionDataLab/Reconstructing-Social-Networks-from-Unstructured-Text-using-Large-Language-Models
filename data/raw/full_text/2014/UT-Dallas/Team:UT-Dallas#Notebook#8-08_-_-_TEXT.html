We have a set of reporter vectors that we grew and harvested the DNA last week. Today, to qualitatively check that we got what we want, we are going to test digest our reporter vectors. After the check, we will send our second batch of sequencing order.
Today's tasks:
Glycerol Stock of P+tcpS+RBS+eYFP
Transformation of reporter vectors for ctxA, tcpJ, tcpP, tcpS
Test digested gRNA vectors with 2% gel for i5.22.5,i5.22.8,i5.22.21,i5.22.12,i5.22.3,i5.22.24.
Test digested tcpS reporter vectors.
Our weird fish bone gel test. Look at the 2 log ladder!
This is the nice 2% gel with 50bp ladder.
