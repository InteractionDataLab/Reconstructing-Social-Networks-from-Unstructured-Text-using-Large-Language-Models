Yesterday we transformed the chromoprotein and streaked M13, and we were expecting colorful plates. We have 10 plates full of colonies. They didn't show very clear colors (the pink and purple were easiest one to see; orange and lime were terrible because it's very similar to the nature color of our E.Coli and broth.) Our negative plate also had colonies. So we inoculate them today, along with RBS-Carb from glycerol stock.
Miniprep tomorrow. Hopefully the cells in liquid would show clearer colors and the broth would be colorful! We picked some sketchy-color-looking chromoprotein colonies. After that, we will do overnight digestion for the RBS-Carb to get the Card resistance gene out of the plasmid.
Today's tasks:
Transform tcpD, toxT repoter vectors
Inoculate chromoproteins, M13 parts
Inoculate 3 tubes of i5.4.7 (RBS-Carb)
Digest Reporter vectors from the first batch
We are suppose to do gel purify the digested reporter vectors. But our bands were really hard to separate, so we ran it for a while, took a photo to check it, and then ran some more. Here is a very cool timelapse of our gel. The bands were close but Rishika, the professional gel cutter managed to cut them out.
