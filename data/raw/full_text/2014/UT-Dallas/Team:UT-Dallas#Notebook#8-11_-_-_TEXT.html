A short meeting (2 hours) to discuss our progress so far and further prospective of our project.
We have a set of reporter vectors that we grew and harvested the DNA last week. Today, to qualitatively check that we got what we want, we are going to test digest our reporter vectors. After the check, we will send our second batch of sequencing order.
Kristina brought lots of food: cookies, muffins, etc. We also have a dry ice party at the end of lab day!
Today's tasks:
Miniprep tcpS clones
Test digest Reporter plasmids for ctxA, tcpJ, tcpP, and tcpS
Streak M13.
Ligate + transform chromoproteins [P+RBS+chromo]
Set up overnight ligation for tcpD, toxT.
