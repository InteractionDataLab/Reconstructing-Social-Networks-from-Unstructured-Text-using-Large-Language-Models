We started using Kristina's home stock cells now instead of our own cells along with the commercial cells.
We have a set of reporter vectors that we grew and harvested the DNA last week. Today, to qualitatively check that we got what we wanted, we are going to test digest our reporter vectors. After that is checked, we will send our second batch of sequencing order.
Kristina brought lots of food: cookies, muffins, etc.
Today's tasks:
Transform.
List out mis-match of gRNA&reporter vectors.
Inoculate reporter vector from glycerol stock.
Preparing cells for plasmid purification.
