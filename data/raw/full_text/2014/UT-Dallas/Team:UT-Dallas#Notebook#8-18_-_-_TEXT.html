Today is a long day. We are test digesting Tra's minipreped first batch of reporter vectors on Carb backbone from this past weekend. Two clones failed so we picked 2 colonies from each failed clone plates ctxA(2) and ctxB(2) and inoculated them. We will miniprep and test digest them again tomorrow. We threw out the miniprep products and glycerol stocks for the failed one. We got some confusion with the gel because Tra loaded multiple wells with the same sample.
We are digesting second batch of reporter vectors, and performing a 30 minute ligate on Carb backbone and then transform them. Hopefully tomorrow there will be colonies on our plates. We will pick the colonies, inoculate. The day after tomorrow we will glycerol stock them, miniprep and test digest our product. Hopefully we will have good product to complete parts of our BioBricks, (and we won't have to redo everything again) and we will keep them for later experiments.
We also digested RBS-Carb to get more Carb back bone for later use.
Lastly we did an overnight ligation for the third batch of reporters and promotors.
Today's tasks:
Inoculate more colonies (2) ctxA and (2) ctxB.
Test digest first batch Carb-reporter vectors.
Digest RBS-Carb.
Digest, gel electrophoresis, gel purify, ligate on Carb-back bone, and transform 5 reporter vectors from the second batch.
Overnight Ligation for third batch of reporters and promoters
