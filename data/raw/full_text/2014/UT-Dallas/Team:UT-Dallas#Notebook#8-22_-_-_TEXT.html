Today is also long day. (We almost repeated everything we did yesterday: inoculation, miniprep, ligation, and transformation. Also, sequencing results are here.
Second batch (B2):
toxT: got very high noise in the background. We are possibly re-sequencing them.
tcpA: (gRNA+Promoter) first clone was wrong after sequencing. We have two clones so we will re-test-digesting-2%-gel them and send them out for sequencing.
Third batch (B3): Yesterday, we transformed reporter-Carb; today, we inoculate them. The colonies are not very big, we have about 3 colonies on the negative; however, the other plates are very good: they has at least twice-fold the colonies on the negative.
Forth batch (B4): We inoculated yesterday. We are minipreping, digesting, ligating onto Carb back bone, and transforming them
tcpQ is being re-digested and re-tested on 2% gel to make sure of our clone. We tested it on 1% gel but it created a smear and was dubious.
Ran out of PstI-HF!!! Need to order!!!
Tomorrow: For B4 reporters and B3 gRNA, inoculation. B3 reporters: miniprep. Sunday, we will miniprep. Next week, on Monday, we should have everything ready for test digest and then finally send the last batch of sequencing!
Today's tasks:
B3 reporter vectors on Chlora: Inoculate
B4 reporters-chlora: Glycerol stock + Miniprep + digest + gel extract + purify + ligate + transform onto carb back bone.
Inoculate acfA(3)-chlora reporter.
