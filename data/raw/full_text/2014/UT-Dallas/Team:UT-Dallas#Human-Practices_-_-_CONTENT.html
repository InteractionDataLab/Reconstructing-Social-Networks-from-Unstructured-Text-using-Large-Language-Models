The World Jamboree epitomizes this idea: no matter what part of the globe we call home, we all speak the language of synthetic biology.
If science is the ‘universal language,’ why don’t we see its effects applied more equitably? Why do some groups have greater access to the new technologies created in labs? So many iGEM projects have the goal of helping those who need it the most—victims of poverty, natural disasters, or those who suffer simply from a lack of infrastructure. What are some of the major hurdles we face in bringing our innovations to those whom they were created to help? What can we, as scientists, do to solve this problem? Where do we start?
To answer these questions, our team decided to collect as many outside perspectives as we could. We spoke with professors of sociology, science education, political science, and bioengineering; with one of the educators who inspired us to go into science; physicians; but most importantly, we spoke to students—ranging from graduate students to kindergarteners. In these many conversations, we came to realize that the answer came down to science literacy and education. Here we present the results of our findings, and the contributions we were able to make to a broader set of solutions.</DIV></SECTION><SECTION class="demo"><DIV class="spacer s1"><DIV class="page_content"><H2>the Humanities</H2><H3>Sociology</H3><I>Richard Scotch is a Professor of Sociology, Public Policy, and Political Economy at the University of Texas at Dallas. His most recent research focuses on healthcare access and disabilities. Amongst other appointments, he has served as a consultant for the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare, as well as a Congressional Science Fellow. </I>We began our quest by asking why healthcare quality and access to technology did not reflect the rate at which new discoveries were being made. Why are the benefits of science and engineering distributed inequitably? 
There is a certain degree of overlap between the groups that lack reliable healthcare access and those that traditionally have a lesser representation in science. In particular, certain racial minorities, women, and disabled persons tend to be amongst those most often shunned by the healthcare and educational systems. We asked Dr. Richard Scotch if, in solving one of these problems, we might be able to kill two birds with one stone. 
While a great deal of the problem lies in the complicated realm of insurance law and broader economic problems, one of the many contributing factors lies in a communicative disconnect between science and minorities. This gap may exist for many different reasons—socioeconomic standing, cultural belief, and educational background, to name a few. Changing the way we teach science might improve the situation—in an increasingly diverse environment, it is important for teachers to make science applicable to a broader set of students. One of the ways to do this is to teach in a way that centers around the student, rather than a teacher lecturing at the front of a classroom. Encouraging class discussions and question-answer sessions is a tactic that has worked well for the humanities. 
However, Scotch says, part of the problem comes from the scientific community. There seems to be a common belief within the scientific community that it is not very important for scientists and engineers to be able to communicate effectively outside of the professional environment. This is simply not true. Part of the solution, he says, may be as simple as having an open dialogue with your neighbors or colleagues. If scientists and engineers can, on even a personal level, maintain an open dialogue with people in other fields, science will inevitably become a larger part of everyday life. This is one of the many goals of this project. 


<H3>Political Science</H3><I>Dr. Douglas Dow is a Professor of Political Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, as well as the codirector of the Honors College. He specializes in political theory, public law, legal theory and history, and American politics. </I>Policy does not always reflect the current body of scientific knowledge. Part of the problem arises from the fact that the information that the scientific community brings to the table does not always align with the goals of policy makers and economists. ‘The state of North Carolina, for example, had recently elected to simply disallow the use of current and projected sea level data in political cost benefit analysis [regarding development of the coast],’ says Dr. Douglas Dow, a professor of political science at the University of Texas at Dallas, ‘This would clearly create some conflicts.’  Nevertheless, scientists are far from mute in political sphere. ‘Scientists actually have a major place… in the public policy making process,’ says Dow. Policy makers frequently rely upon science to inform their policy decisions. Selective acceptance of scientific theory, however, seems to be a significant cause of the gap between policy and science—suggesting some sort of broader incompatibility between the two fields. Part of problem, Dow explained, is due to certain fundamental differences in the way that the humanities and the sciences are taught to communicate information. ‘Science is about probability,’ he says, ‘it’s not about an absolute yes or no. That makes for hypotheses that can sometimes be complicated to understand.’ These complicated topics, coupled with a lack of absolute certainty, can be easily manipulated and over simplified—often, just by accident. 
It is not enough to simply teach science with the goal of graduating more STEM specialists. The rift between policy and science at hand calls for a more complete integration of science and the humanities, combining the best facets of each academic tradition. To better understand how we might accomplish this, we turned next to Master Teacher and science educator Dr. James McConnell.  </DIV></DIV><DIV class="spacer s1"><SECTION class="demo"><DIV class="page_content"><H2>Education</H2><P style="display:block"><I>Jim McConnell is a Master Teacher with the UTeach Teacher Education Program at the University of Texas at Dallas. He has taught high school science in the North Texas area for many years prior to joining the UTeach program.</I></P>Few would argue the importance of a quality science education for all students, regardless of whether or not they ultimately choose to pursue science as a career.  It has become a concern of the highest level: since 2008, President Barack Obama has significantly increased funding for STEM education. Through the course of this project we have realized, however, that education needs to do more than bestow basic science and engineering skills upon students. The effective science curriculum does not paint a picture of science as a subject within a vacuum, but rather encourages students to make connections between science and the outside world. For the kindergarten students at the Dallas Community Lighthouse KidsU program, this may simply mean discovering a connection between the organelles of a cell and parts of the human body. But as these kids grow as students, we would like them to be able to make the connections between science and policy, science and business, science and philosophy. Our educators should aim to create a class of graduates who will go on to pursue myriad careers and goals, but who understand that the connections between science and other disciplines are very real—and subsequently, are well versed in the scientific process.  
 Though much of the problem may lie in broader socioeconomic and policy trends, we knew that we could make an impact on a personal level. In fact, when we talked to some of the people who worked in our lab and some of the neighboring labs, we found that a passion for science often starts on the personal level. Though the stories are diverse, there is one common thread: someone simply took the extra time and effort to make science applicable and interesting. One such mentor is Diane Sweeney, a high school biology teacher and former researcher at Genentech. Scientist-teachers like Sweeney can bring a unique approach to education. When you teach something that you are passionate about, both teacher and student benefit.<H3>The Shortfalls of STEM Education in Texas</H3>
 Since education is a nearly universal concern, we decided to seek solutions close to home. The Dallas Fort-Worth Metroplex is home to over 40 school districts. According to the Texas Education Agency, public school districts in the DFW area have the largest share of schools rated ‘academically unacceptable’ in the state of Texas. These schools also tend to have the lowest scores in state science and math benchmark tests. Of all the subjects, STEM arguably suffers the most from a lack of funding and resources. STEM education generally requires a higher level of education and expertise on part of teachers. Many science classes are lab based or may require specialized equipment and facilities. Despite these hurdles, a solid foundation in science is only becoming more vital in today’s society. All of our diverse interviewees agreed on this point. </DIV></SECTION></DIV><DIV class="spacer s1"><DIV class="page_content"><H2>Science And Engineering</H2><P style="display:block"><I>Shayan Ghassemi, Eric Nezerwa and Taplin Moore are students and researchers in the University of Texas at Dallas bioengineering department. </I></P><H4>Bioengineering and Society</H4>

Regardless of how much time we spend sequestered in the lab, scientists and engineers do not exist within an isolated bubble. Though a scientist's primary objective is the pursuit of knowledge, dissemination and application of this knowledge is also a concern. Engineers, though they share many similarities with scientists, have a distinctly different set of goals. Engineers aim to develop and utilize knowledge into novel applications. Bioengineers exist at a nexus between these two fields, and as such, very successfully accomplishes one of the main goals of this project: the insulation of the transfer of knowledge. Knowledge disseminates along very different pathways: from the lab to the classroom, or to the courtroom, congressional floor, hospital, or industry. As links along that chain, we are partly responsible for maintaining the connections that link knowledge to application. The link between engineers and scientists is very strong, and understandably so- the connection between the fields seems fluid and obvious. We need, however, to strengthen the rest of the chain-- and bioengineers have significant incentive to accomplish this.<H4>Broader Applications and Future Pathways</H4>It is clear why researchers (or anybody) should care about what goes on in the K-12 classroom. Though few would oppose increased involvement in education, many potentially willing volunteers are hazy on the logistics. Without a larger organizing body, the potential for interaction between the classroom and the lab lessens significantly. This task may fit nicely into the realm of the many professional organizations that already bring together scientists and engineers from around the globe. These organizations have the resources, member base, and credibility to facilitate effective and meaningful interactions between the scientist and the student. Gaining the support of these organizations would be a major step in implementing a broader solution in the future.

We chose to work primarily with low income, high risk students in Northeast Dallas through local non-profit Dallas Community Lighthouse. Across DFW, the DCL hosts a community based after school and summer program series called KidsU. <H4>Curriculum Design Goals</H4> 

We had several main goals in mind in developing our curriculum. We wanted to give the students a chance to explore cutting edge topics that are rarely taught at even the best schools. By teaching what we loved and knew best—bioengineering and biology— we hoped that we could pass on some of our passion. 

 Secondly, we wanted to create a lesson that could be easily reproduced without extensive knowledge or resources, so that teachers who may not spend all day in a lab could teach the same lesson with success. 

 Finally, we wanted the lesson to be applicable and engaging—to leave a lasting impact. We knew that each of the students would have a different level of proficiency and interest in the topics we wanted to teach. Often, in poorer school districts, there is a great deal more socioeconomic, ideological and cultural diversity amongst student backgrounds. A standardized, one-size-fits-all curriculum can often leave these students behind.  <H4>Curriculum</H4> 
Though we had a list of concepts we expected each student to understand, we left much of our lesson open to the students to determine. We taught hands-on, lab based lessons and made sure to allot a large fraction of the class time towards encouraging discussion and answering questions. According to Master Teacher Jim McConnell, it can make all the difference if teachers are able to relate a concept to a student’s everyday life. This can be especially true for at-risk schools. You can view and download a sample lesson plan <A href="”https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/5/53/Lesson_Plan.pdf”">here.</A>
Some of the topics we covered were: cellular structure, intra and inter cellular interaction, bacterial anatomy and conjugation, and DNA and DNA editing. Though these topics are often regarded as quite complex (and typically not taught until at least high school) we had great success with these students and a demonstration heavy, discussion based lesson format.  You can view some of the response cards we collected after the lessons below. <H4>Photos</H4></DIV></DIV></SECTION></SECTION></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
