We had a successful outreach!
We went to Cafe Brazil after that.
We found a new friend in the lab while doing miniprep for acfD, acfC, and tcpT.
Our first bank of requested parts have shipped from iGEM headquarters. They include several new chromoproteins for a potential outreach with older participants, and a series of M13 phage coat protein parts.
