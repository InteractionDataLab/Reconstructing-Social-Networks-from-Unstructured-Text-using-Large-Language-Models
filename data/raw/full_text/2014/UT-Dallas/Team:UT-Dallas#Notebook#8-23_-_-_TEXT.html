Today is a long day for weekend. Miniprep and inoculate we did!
Third batch (B3): Yesterday we inoculate the reporter-carb. Today, we need to miniprep them to prepare for Monday test digest. After that we would have every part but one to send out for sequencing!
Forth batch (B4): Yesterday we transformed reporter-carb. Today we inoculate them. The plates are not very good. We don't have much clones on them and negative already had 2 colonies.
Some one put P1 buffer outside!!! We ran out of P1 buffer. Need to make more!!!
Tomorrow: Miniprep is needed for the one inoculated today. Next week, on Monday, we should have everything ready for test digest and then finally send the last batch of sequencing!
Today's tasks:
B3 reporter vectors on Chlora: Miniprep
B4 reporters-carb: Glycerol stock + Miniprep + digest + gel extract + purify + ligate + transform onto carb back bone.
Inoculate acfA(3)-chlora reporter.
 
Terrible, terrible gel! We punctured the gel! The lane bled over each other. We had to make another gel to purify.
(In order, i5.47.1-2-3-4-X-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12)
Updating the wiki notebook from the slowest computer in the building because currently we can't log into any other computer. Rishika is gel-ing the ctx-s.
