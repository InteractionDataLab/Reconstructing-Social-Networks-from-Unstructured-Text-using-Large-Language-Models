Today was a relatively short day. We miniprepped the chromoproteins inoculated yesterday, as well as an RBS with a modified drug resistance (chloramycin to carbenicillin.) Following overnight digestion, we will insert this modified RBS into the reporter vectors so that we may ensure that both of our plasmids (reporter and gRNA) have transformed successfully.
Most of the chromoproteins worked, except for gFAS and scORANGE. We will religate and retransform tomorrow.
Today's tasks:
Miniprep chromoproteins and m13 coat proteins
Miniprep RBS-carb.
Set up overnight digestion with RBS-carb for insert into reporter vector
