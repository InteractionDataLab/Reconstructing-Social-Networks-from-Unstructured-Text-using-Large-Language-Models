PROJECT
Treating infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with antibiotics disrupts a patient's gut microbiota and can increase the prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains. The increasing population of multi-drug resistant bacterial strains, both within and outside of health centers, is a growing health concern that is becoming progressively difficult to treat. Additionally, it is a well-recognized fact within the global health community that traditional antibiotics do not represent a sustainable method of treatment for bacterial infections. There is a clear drive towards minimally invasive, prophylactic therapies for such ailments, but is a demand that so far, has not been adequately met. Our project will aim at replacing broad and narrow spectrum antibiotics with “precision therapies” that have etiology targeting capacity at the species level as well as contain minimal cross-talk among healthy tissues, organs, and symbiotic organisms.
