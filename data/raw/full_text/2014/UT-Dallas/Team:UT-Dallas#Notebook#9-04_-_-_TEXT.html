Megan came in briefly to inoculate two samples of cas9. It seemed like kind of a waste leave the lab at that point, so instead, she read a few transcripts and articles from Rio+20 and the 2010 Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biodiversity, hoping to gauge the international community's perspective on syn bio. It was found that no one quite knows what syn bio is, and whatever misconceptions have arisen are largely seen in a negative light. :(
Today's tasks:
Inoculate two colonies from cas9.
Bioethics research
Colored pellets following centrifugation.
