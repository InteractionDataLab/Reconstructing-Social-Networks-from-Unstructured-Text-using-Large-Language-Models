Today is a short day. Yesterday, we picked 2 colonies from each failed clone plates and inoculate them; today, we minipreped and test digested them. They failed the test digest so we inoculate the rest of the colonies on the plates.
We are sending the gRNA from the third batch and some other reporter vectors for sequencing.
Yesterday, we digested more RBS-Carb; today, we ran it on gel and gel purified it. The concentration at the end was good.
Our clones on the plates transformed yesterday were good: many colonies on the plates and none on the negative.
Orientation! School is starting next week! (25/8) >.<
Today's tasks:
glycerol stock and Miniprep of ctxA, ctxB inoculated on 08/18/14.
Test digest and ran gel for ctxA, ctxB and gel electrophoresis.
Inoculate 2 colonies from each plate transformed yesterday (second batch, reporter vectors on Carb).
Prepared for sequencing: diluted to the correct volume and concentration.
Purified RBS (digested overnight yesterday).
Transformed of overnight ligation yesterday (third batch, reporter vectors with promoters under Chlora).
Inoculate more colonies from ctxA, ctxB plates.
Today's Task
RBS-Carb Gel was good.
Updating the wiki notebook from the slowest computer in the building because currently we can't log into any other computer. Rishika is gel-ing the ctx-s.
