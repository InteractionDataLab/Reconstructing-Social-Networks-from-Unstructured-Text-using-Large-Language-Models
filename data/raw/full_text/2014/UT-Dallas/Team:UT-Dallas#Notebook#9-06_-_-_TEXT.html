After overnight digestion of the wild type cas9, we performed a 5 hour CIP treatment to prevent self ligation. We will also do a 30 min digestion of the gRNA parts ctxA, ctxB, acfA, and acfB. All five of these will be gel purified and then we will ligate the gRNA into the cas9. These parts will be sent out to Colombia iGEM, hopefully sometime next week!
Today's tasks:
CIP treat cas9
digest ctxA, ctxB, acfA, acfB gRNA
Gel purify
Overnight ligation
