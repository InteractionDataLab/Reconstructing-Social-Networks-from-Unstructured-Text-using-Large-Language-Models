After a brief mishap with an uncapped centrifuge tube and an overzealous Megan, we were able to miniprep our cas9. (Good thing we inoculated two samples...) As usual, this was followed by analysis of the sample: nanodrop and a test digestion. We will also speak with iGEM Colombia later today! We're hoping to incorporate their cholera sensor into our depathogenizer. We're also trying to get in touch with a professor here who studies public health to explore the ethical side of our project, and synthetic biology as a whole.
Today's tasks:
Miniprep 1.5 samples of cas9.
Nanodrop and test digest cas9.
Skype meeting with Colombia iGEM and their advisor.
Colored pellets following centrifugation.
