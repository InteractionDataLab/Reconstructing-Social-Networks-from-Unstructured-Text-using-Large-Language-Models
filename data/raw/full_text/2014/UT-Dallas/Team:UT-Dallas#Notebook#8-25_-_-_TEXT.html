On the weekend, we did a bunch of inoculation and minipreps reporter vectors and gRNAs. Today we test digest them. If they're all good, they're good to go for sequencing and the last thing to do would be almost just waiting for cas9 to be delivered. Classes started again for everyone except Sam and Tyler.
Today's tasks:
Test digested Carb reporter vectors: tcpB, tcpQ, tcpR, tcpT, acfC, acfD, tcpE, tcpF
Test digested gRNA vectors: acfA, acfB, tcpA, tcpF, tcpQ
Test digested & gel purified Chlora-reporter vectors for acfA.
Today's Task
Test digest was great! Successfully built all the gRNA on Chlora!
