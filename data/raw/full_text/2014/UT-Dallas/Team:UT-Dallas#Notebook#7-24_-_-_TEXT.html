On July 24, 2014 we started our lab day making glycerol stock from the tubes of bacterial cells that we inoculated the previous night. When that was completed we mini prepped the inoculated test tubes to get purified DNA. When we finally had our purified DNA for the labeled tubes i5.25.1-5 we began to set up our test digestion  using xbal and pst for the restriction enzyme and cutsmart for the buffer and of course water and DNA. We prepared our digestion and as we waited for the digestion to complete we prepared our gel. Once the gel was complete as shown in figure 7.24.2 our results yielded gel bands that came out great that meant that our bacterial clones were correct. We also practice our lesson plans for tomorrows out reach project at the kids campus Kids U and prepared our prizes and treats for the children as seen in figure 7.24.3 and 7.24.4
Today's tasks:
We will Walk through our lesson plans for our community out reach project with Kids U.
Do a Test Digestion and Gel Electrophoresis for parts i5.25.1-5
Make Glycerol & miniprep (tcpB, tcpD, tcpQ).
Inoculate (acfA, acfC, acfD, tcpT)(for acfA and acfB there were no colonies on the plate) we will need to back tack and see why colonies did not grow on those two plates.
Prepare the sequencing order.
and Prepare props for Friday's outreach program
