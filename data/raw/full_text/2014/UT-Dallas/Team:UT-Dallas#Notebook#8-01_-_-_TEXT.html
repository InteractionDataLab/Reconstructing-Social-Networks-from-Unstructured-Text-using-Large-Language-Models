A relatively short day in the lab. We are in the process of fundamentally improving our cloning protocols after failure of 40 of our gRNA plates.
On Saturday, Megan will come in to inoculate colonies from today's transformation of ctxB as well as the new chromoprotein plates. On Sunday, Sam will come to do a miniprep of all these parts.
Today's tasks:
Transform ligation from yesterday (Promoter-RBS-ctxB)plus negative and positive controls. Ligation was done at 16 degrees overnight.
Miniprep tcfF-RBS-eYFP (PCR product)
Run test digestion on aforementioned miniprep.
Streak chromoprotein stab cultures from registry:
BBa_K1033905: RBS + tsPURPLE, purple chromoprotein
BBa_K1033918: RBS + gfasPURPLE, purple chromoprotein
BBa_K1033913: RBS + scORANGE, orange chromoprotein
BBa_K1033915: RBS + amajLIME, green chromoprotein
BBa_k1033925: RBS + spisPINK, pink chromoprotein
BBa_K1033927: RBS + asPINK, pink chromoprotein
BBa_K1033930: RBS + amilCP, blue/purple chromoprotein
