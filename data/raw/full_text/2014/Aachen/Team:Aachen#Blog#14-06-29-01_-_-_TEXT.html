Blog #16 - iGEM team at RWTH Open House
By NBailly 15:22, June 29 2014 (CDT)
Yesterday, RWTH organized an open house for students from ages 14 to 16. Different departments, institutes and student councils presented exhibits, latest research projects, and the many programs they offer. Students could actively try out science and research in prepared experiments at each stand. Various groups of student representatives also offered first hand advice to students with respect to what to study and when and where to collect information. In presentations about the different fields of studies, students gained first insights into the world of academic professions and other career perspectives.
Nina and Florian showed students how they can get involved in research outside of the programs.
Our iGEM team, too, supported the bioscience department with our own stand. We presented a prototype of our measurement device Cellock Holmes that students could use to measure the fluorescence of different riboflavin solutions. Apart from giving general advice as university students to high school students, Nina and Florian explained students how they can get involved in research outside of a specific university program.
