1st
Organization
Getting all kind of lab equipment
key cards and keys for the lab
cooled centifuge
space reservation in -80°C freezer
bottles for 70% ethanol
... (problems of a first year team ^^)
12th
chemically competent E. coli NEB Top10, DH5α and BL21 were made
15th
800 ml LB for plates with 1.5% agar and kanamycin (50 µg/L) were prepared
test of transformation efficiency of our competent cells
Colonies on the agar plates were counted after transformation with 1 µl DNA (147 ng/µl)
Cells had been incubated in SOC or LB medium

SOC: 100 LB: 79
SOC: 25 LB: 22
SOC: 9 LB: 9
SOC: 1 LB:0
BL21 cells were centrifuged and plated; only 128 colonies grew in total indicating a very bad efficiency (~482.11).
Following formula was used to calculate the efficiency: Efficiency = (CFU /µg DNA) / Dilution
for DH5α: medial efficiency in SOC: 1864.36, and in LB: 440.68
for NEB:  medial efficiency in SOC: 6779.66, and in LB: 4698.30
Higher efficiency when using SOC!

5 µl of the PCR products were run on a 1,5% agarose gel
DNA bands were purified from gel with the High Pure Product Purification Kit. Full length products were contaminated with REACh1

The DNA concentration of the SOE2 products were measured after purification

2: 69.5 ng/µL
29th
PCR SOE1 and SOE2
30th
A PAGE of the SOE2 products was run on agarose gel for checking
→ no positive results; only full length products were amplified
SOE PCRs were run again
→ more template
→ hot start
→ faster
→ elongation: 15 min
→ 20 cycles
