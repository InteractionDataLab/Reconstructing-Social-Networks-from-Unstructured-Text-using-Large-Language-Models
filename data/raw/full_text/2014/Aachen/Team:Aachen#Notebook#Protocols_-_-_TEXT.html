Protocols
In our experiments, we often re-used protocols for basic experimental steps. For a better overview, we split our protocols into four categories:
2D Detection of IPTG & HSL
Culture Media
Molecular Biological Methods
Analytical Methods
To access the protocols, please click on the respective category panel below:
