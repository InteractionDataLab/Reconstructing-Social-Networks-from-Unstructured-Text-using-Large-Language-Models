3rd
34 BioBricks were transformed
4th
Preparation of consumables:
fresh 50% glycerol
new LB plates with cam and with kanamycin (kan)
60 glas tubes
2 L LB-
100 mL steril glas beads for plating
Master plates (6 clones per BioBrick) were made
5th
Colony PCRs on all transformed BioBricks were conducted
→ 2 clones from each master plate were picked
Overnight cultures in freshly prepared 5 mL LB + cam were inoculated
→ 1 culture per BioBrick
6th
2 glycerol stocks of each BioBrick were made
14th
PCR of E0030 to K1319000
Q5 and Phusion polymerase were used

23rd
Yesterdays colony PCR was repeated
Precultures for plasmid preps were inoculated
K1319000 → sequencing
K592100 → BFP
S01022 → CFP
J23101.E0240 → sequencing
J23115.E0240 → sequencing
K516132 and J23101.E0240 were plated on LB + cam plates
24th
8 plasmid preps were conducted
Overnight cultures of K516132 and J23101.E0240 were inoculated
25th
Preculture for competent NEB10β cells was set up
Samples for sequencing were submitted
Master plates of transformed BioBricks were made
Overnight expression cultures of J23101.E0240 and K516132 were centrifuged and frozen
Fresh 50% glycerol was prepared
26th
Competent NEB10β cells were made, however, several things went wrong. (For future reference: pre-cool centrifuge, always check if it is indeed spinning, frequently check OD of the culture)
Colony PCR on the transformed clones looked awful; there were too many cells in the 10 µL reaction volume. Some tubes were not fully sealed during the PCR. Basically, only primers and smear, except for the positive control, which contained a plasmid template instead of cells.
2x 500 mL of fresh LB and three sterile flasks were prepared and autoclaved.
