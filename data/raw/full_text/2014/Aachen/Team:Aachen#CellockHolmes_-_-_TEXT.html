Mr Holmes
Cellock Holmes
Our device Cellock Holmes is designed to be an automated 2D fluorescence analyser. We aim to be able to quickly measure the fluorescence emitted by our sensor cells and automatically analyze the emitted images with our software Measurarty. This will enabel us to reliably detect the amount of CFU (colony forming units) of the pathogens present on the sample. The device will have different filters for different wavelenghts included to be able to analyze different fluorescent proteins at the same time.
More information will be available soon!
