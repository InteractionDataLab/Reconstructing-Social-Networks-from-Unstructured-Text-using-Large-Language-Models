Testing Team Heidelbergs pSBX-vectors
The iGEM team Heidelberg constructed a set of expression vectors that contain a T7 promoter prior to the BioBrick prefix. This way RBS-CDS parts can be cloned into the vectors by standard BioBrick assembly and then expressed in BL21(DE3) by induction with IPTG.
Heidelberg X-press vector design
The iGEM Team Heidelberg created new expression vectors with an integrated T7 Promoter
In collaboration with the iGEM Team Heidelberg the iGEM Team Aachen tested 8 of these vectors for their expression capabilities.
We successfully cloned and expressed one of our fusion proteins K139020 in a pSBX1A3 vector. You can read more about the background of this expression on the Galectin-3 page .

We also used an mRFP selection marker with a constant expression of mRFP as a positive control.
To find out more about the Results of the characterization check out the the collaboration page of Team Heidelberg .

Fluorescence data of pSBX cultivation
While the positive control did show an increase of fluorescence to a maximum of ca. 20000 relative fluorescence units, there appeared to be something wrong with the pSBX expression strains. We did not have the time to check what exactly was wrong with the cells, but it's not because of the vectors, because we successfully used the pSBX1A3 to express our K1319020 fusion protein.
