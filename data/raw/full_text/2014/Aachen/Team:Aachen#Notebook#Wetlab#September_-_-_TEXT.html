Finally, we did the Gibson assembly and a heat shock transformation into NEB10β cells.
At 10:15, we inoculated the primary cultures of the interlab study experiment and began with regular fluorescence measurements.
5th
made master plates of yesterday's transformed cells.
As described in the article by Elling [1], Gal3 binds on the LPS of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To demonstrate this behavior several experiments were conducted. The experiments included the binding of Gal3 to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, E.coli, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The precultures were washed two times in PBS, resuspended in 10 and 50 ng/ml of YFP-Gal3 and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards, all samples were examined in the fluorescence microscope. As a positive control NEB10ß cells with E0030 were used. Unfortunatly, a fluorescence was not visually detectable, with exception of the positive control.
6th
made precultures of 3 clones from each prepared master palte and inoculated precultures for OD/F measurements as well as chip production on the 7th.
7th
made cryos stocks of the precultures

15th
analyze the sequencing data from the clones of GFP_Reach 1, GFP_Reach 2 and K1319008.
GFP_Reach 2 clone #3 and #5 were fine, including the Leu to Ile mutation. GFP_Reach 1 clone #4 and #5 were fine and did not contain the Leu to Ile mutation. Clone #6 was fine but contained the Leu to Ile mutation from the Reach 1 quick change mutations.
For future experiments, we will use the GFP_Reach 1 clone #4 and the GFP_Reach 2 clone #4.
Transformation of GFP_Reach 1 clone #3 and GFP_Reach 2 clones #3 and #5 were performed together with the TEV protease to create two plasmid construct.
The GFP_Reach 1 and GFP_Reach 2 constructs were also restricted and ligated into the pSB1C3 vector from the pSB3K3 vector.
over night cultures of  K131026 in DH5α and NEB
16th
made master plates of the transformation from the day before.
Also PCRs were made from pSBXA3, I20260 and K131900 for a Gibson assembly. The PCRs were checked with a gel electrophoresis.

tested Pseudomonas fluoresence if they are suitable for a growth experiment that is planned for our collaboration with the NEAnderLab next week. Therefore, she filled 2 500 mL flasks with 30 mL LB Pseudomonas-F medium, and inoculated each one with 1 mL culture medium of the overnight preculture. Flasks were inoculated at 30°C at 250 rpm. However, after 5 hours no exponential growth could be shown (s. plot below). Thus, it was decided to use a E. coli K12 derivate strain in TB medium instead, and 30 mL of TB medium in a 500 mL flask were inoculated with E. coli DH5α cells and incubated at 37°C at 300 rpm over night. According to the DSMZ E . coli K12 strain derivates, such as DH5α, are adequate for the kind of school experiment we are planning with the NEAnderLab.
Growth Curves
Unfortunately, P. fluorescens did not show a nice exponential growth curve over the observed 5 hours.
19th
made flask cultures of K1319013, K1319013 + K1319008, K1319013 + K1319008 + iPTG, K1319014, K1319014 + K1319008, K1319014 + K1319008 + iPTG, B0015 (negative control) and I20260 (positive control). iPTG was added at an OD of ~0.5. Inoculation was done via precultures in 500 ml shake flasks (50 ml filling volume). Media was always LB. Cultivation was done at 37°C and 300 rpm. The starting OD was aimed to be 0.1. Inoculation occured directly from the precultures. Samples were taken every hour and checked for OD and fluorescence using a spectrophotometer and plate reader, respectively.
did plasmid preparation from the cultures of the day before (K1319013, K1319013 + K1319008, K1319013 + K1319008 + iPTG, K1319014, K1319014 + K1319008, K1319014 + K1319008 + iPTG, B0015 and I20260). The plasmid were then be cut with EcoRI and PstI, and the results were be put on an agarose gel in order to perform a restriction test.  Also plasmids of K1319013 and K1319014 will be cut with EcoRi and SpeI. K1319008 will be cut with XbaI and PstI. These will then be ligated together and then ligated into a pSB1A3 vector via the 3A assembly (vector cut with EcoRI and PstI). These constructs will be transformed into BL21 (and NEB as a backup). The created construts will be known as K1319018 (K1319013.K1319008) and K1319019 (K1319014.K1319008).
made precultures of the master plates from the day before (K1319008, K1319013, K1319015 and pSBX1A3 with Gal3).
also inoculated 4 cultures for the further testing of the OD/F Device (the F part). The cultures are 2 shake flasks of I20260 and 2 shake flasks of B0015.
Furthermore, did a growth experiment with DH5α for the NEAnderLab school experiment. 3 500 mL shake flasks were filled with 50 mL TB medium, and inoculated to an OD of 1.5 with the overnight preculture. Samples were taken every 30 minutes and tested for OD using our own device as well as the spectrophotometer. The resulting growth curve is shown below. we concluded that the growth was fast enough for these growth conditions to be used for the school experiment on the 24th.
Growth Curves
Growth under these conditions was sufficient for the school experiment to be carried in 5 hours. And our device did a good job measuring, too!
made chips with K1319013 + K1319008, K1319014 + K1319008, K1319013, K1319014, B0015 and K131026. Images were taken every 30 minutes with our own device.
tested our OD/F Device with a dilution test. Samples were checked with the spectrophotometer (OD), our OD/F Device (fluorescence) and platereader (fluorescence).
made two SDS gels.
inoculated a culture of K1319008, B0015 as well as I20260 to check whether the results from our construct are from a wrongly done Gibson assembly with a still functioning superfolded GFP (the TEV protease was inserted in a backbone that formely contained superfolded GFP.)

22nd
we poured several Pseudomonas-F agar plates with 0, 150 and 300 µg/L for the NEAnderLab school experiment. She also autoclaved 12 500 mL shake flasks, partly to be used for the school collaboration on Wednesday.
26th
We did a check PCR on several cryo cultures. All samples with G00100_Alternative+K1319004_check_R combinations resulted in a strong band at ~2300 bp that we cannot explain. All G00100_Alternative+K1319004_check_R combinations resulted in a strong band at 900 bp that we cannot explain either. We concluded that the annealing temperatures were wrong and favored unspecific products. Therefore, we decided to do a gradient PCR to find out the optimal annealing temperatures for our new primers.

Gradient PCR 3
The primers were G00100_Alternative and K1319004_check_R and they worked well at all temperatures from 60-68°C. To our disappointment, the K1319008 template did not contain K1319004. It is unclear why the 5 bands of K1319008 and I746916 look different.
The results of these three PCRs are:
KAPA2G Fast ReadyMix worked well
all three primers work well at >65°C annealing temperature
K1319008 template contained I746916 instead of the intended K1319004 ORF
It was concluded that a similar check PCR with 65°C annealing temperature will be done on all plasmids and cryos of K1319008.
27th
First we transformed K1319001, K1319002, K1319003 and K1319004 (all in pSB1C3) into NEB10β cells. He tested the PCR machine for semi-automated heat-shocking by splitting the 50 µL cells with the plasmid into 2x 25 µL. All 100 µL were plated for all construct/machine combinations.
transformed several constructs into chemically competent BL21(DE3) cells.
we did colony-PCR on all plasmids, cryos and colonies that should contain the K1319004 sequence.
we also made check a PCR on galectin-constructs:
