Blog #4 - We are approved!
By AZimmermann 11:00, May 4 2014 (CDT)
Hello iGEM enthusiasts,
we are more than happy to finally be able to announce that our application has been finally approved by the iGEM headquarters. Now nothing will stand between us and our journey towards the giant Jamboree at the end of October!
This will bring a few changes towards especially this site. With the approval we now have access to our own wiki website hosted on the iGEM servers. We will migrate all our previous content towards this site in the next weeks. This will include everyhting already posted on here. As soon as we have finished preparing the full migration you will automatically be redirected, so you do not need to remember a different website for all your IGEM Aachen information.
As soon as the migrations has been completed you will also find all the details you need to know about our project we have been teasing about the past weeks on facebook and twitter. So stay tuned!
The project has been progressing nicely in part due to the awesome iGEM Kits provided by NEB:
NEB you are awesome!
Also as always you can follow us on Facebook or Twitter for more information and a look behind the scenes.
