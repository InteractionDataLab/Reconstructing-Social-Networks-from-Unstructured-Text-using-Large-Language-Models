Mr Holmes
Standalone Software
In this section of our notebook, we provide you with details about our three standalone applications, Measurearty, Serial Client and Timeseries Labeller. We have developed these programs for different aspects of our project and used them in combination with electrical hardware and biological experiments . However, they are very versatile and may be used for completely different purposes.
