Mr Holmes
Visiting Team Bielefeld
On the way back home from the Maker Faire , René, Florian, Ansgar and Michael suddenly found themselves in Bielefeld, the city they thought didn't exist (read more about the Bielefeld conspiracy ). After a moment of disorientation, they called our friends from Bielefeld-CeBiTec who invited them on some cake and a discussion on iGEM.
Aachen meets Bielefeld
After many years of iGEM participations, they gladly gave us useful advice that helped a lot in planning the forthcoming months of our iGEM project.
And of course our delegation did not miss the opportunity to invite them to be alpha-testers of our fluorescence-measurement device.
