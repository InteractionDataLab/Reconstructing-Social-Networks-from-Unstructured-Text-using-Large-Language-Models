The agarose gel with PCR product was made. Expected length is 778 kb.
Agarose gel with PCR products after PCR from E0030 to K1319000
as it can be seen on the picture PCR worked with all annealing temperatures, all samples were used for a transformation in DH5α after the restriction with DpnI.
17th
the PCR product was purificated and the concentration was measured.
Restriktion of PCR product for the insert and E0030 for the vector with EcoRI and PstI with following purification from agarose gel was made.
21st
the ligation of PCR product (K1319000) and the vector that was purified from agarose (from E0030) was made.
ligated product was tranformed in DH5α.
22nd
made 100x stocks for Hartmans minimal medium.
made about 25 HM+C plates without glucose.
K1319042 was plated on a HM+C plate
23rd
made 25 new HM+C plates with 1% agar and 4 g/L glucose
added 170 µL of the glucose stock (500 g/L) to the glucose-free HM+C-plates
1 L of sterile HM+glucose was prepared
K1319042 was plated on HM+C+Glucose and HM+C+Glucose drops, 3x 5 mL HM+C+Glucose precultures were inoculated (17:00)
24th
K1319042 did not grow, neither on the plates, nor on in the liquid media. The most probable cause is that the E. coli is missing some vitamins
Based on the M9 recipes by the Knight and Endy labs on OpenWetWare , we made a 20 mL supplement stock solution that can be added to 1x HM media

The powders for 1 L of 1x HM were dissolved in 20 mL of a 10% w/v Casamino acid stock solution and filter-sterilized (.22 µm PES). To make agar chips, we can add 1 mL to the hot agar mixture, together with the three 500 µL 100x stocks for the HM.
We made 250 mL of HM+C+Glucose+Supplements plates with 1.5% agar.
Then we plated the following combinations:

We also prepared a 150 mL HM+C+Glucose+Supplements culture with K1319042 to hopefully make agar chips on Friday, July 25th.
Six of last weeks J23115.E0240 clones were plated on LB+C, and 5 mL LB+C precultures were inoculated for plasmid preparation.
25th
The K1319042 strain did not grow on the HM plate, while another strain with the J23101.E0240 construct did. Both have the pSB1C3 backbone. To confirm the plasmids and inserts, we set up a colony PCR:

We mini-prepped the 6 overnight cultures of J23115.E0240 clones. He used 3 mL instead of 1.5 mL culture medium and eluted twice with 25 µL nuclease-free water. Everything else was according to the protocol of the illustra plasmidPrep Mini-Spin Kit .
The resulting DNA concentrations are listed in this table:

In the evening, we plated some strains on the different media to investigate why the K3139042 did not grow on the HM+suppl. plate. (Note: In the morning, we re-inoculated the HM+C+suppl. shake flask with cells from the LB-plate and by afternoon the culture did grow to a high cell density.)
