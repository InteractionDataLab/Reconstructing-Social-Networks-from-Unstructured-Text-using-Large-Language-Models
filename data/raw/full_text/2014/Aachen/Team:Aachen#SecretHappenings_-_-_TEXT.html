Mr Holmes
Mr. Holmes Secret Logbook
Please, please do not take this sub-page serious. It's probably everything - but not serious.
In fact, most team members know that this website exists. But it silently documents all the funny aspects of our project.
First, even we as team Aachen 2014 - we're actually the first team of our university - performed experiments that didn't end well.
It's never a good sign if already the blank rather tries to escape than to stay.
Especially with our own-minded experiments we had some rainy days in the lab
but also some bright moments, where we could spread peace, love and happiness :)
How many biologists does a computer scientist need to nail a camera?
Exact. 3.
But not only the biological experiments created a high level of frustration, but also the hardware ...
... or software.
At times we really wanted to kill each other ...
... but we had those cool moment where stuff really worked out ...
... and just some other bright moments.
Now at the day of wiki-freeze we're really tired ...
... but really, overall we had a fun time with our igem and loved to stand together for our project
