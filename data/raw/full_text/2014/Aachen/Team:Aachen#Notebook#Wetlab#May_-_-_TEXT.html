May
1st
A gel with M - full -full - REACh1 SOE3.2 - REACH2 SOE3.2 - M was run
→ 120 V, 30 min
→ cut out the bands
5th
Chemical competent DH5α and BL21 cells were made
8th
The efficiency of our competent cells was tested
→ BL21: 6.6 x 104 clones/µg DNA
→ DH5α: 2.59 x 107 clones/µg DNA
SOE-PCR step 2 like on 30.04. with the template of SOE1 from 30.04. was re-done
The SOE2 product was run on a gel for checking (5 µL)
→ restriction, (dephosphorylation of vector)
→ purification on a gel with high pure kit
14th
LB agar plates with chloramphenicol and some with ampicillin were made
REACh2 was purified on 1.2% agarose gel
A subsequent purification of the 778 bp fragment with High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit was done
19th
K131026 (AHL inducible GFP) was transformed into DH5α and NEB
K731520 (IPTG inducible GFPmut3b) was transformed into DH5α
20th
Master plates with chloramphenicol (cam) → at least 6 clones on each plate
2x 5 mL LB + cam were prepared
Sterile 50% glycerol was made
21th
Cryo stocks of clones 1 & 2 of each BioBrick/ host were prepared
15 mL cultures in 250 mL flasks, inoculated with 1.5 mL preculture (3 cultures A B C from clones 1; 1 + 2; 2)
250 µl cam from a 35 mg/mL stock was added
The cultures were grown until OD600= 0.6, then one was induced with IPTG

→ A negative control without plasmid was left out
23rd
Some BioBricks were transformed
Colony PCR (s. picture below)
→ K131026: 1807 bp
→ K731520: 2123 bp
→ full length EYFP: 778 bp
Colony PCR
