Mr Holmes
Timeseries Labeller
A common task in the processing of visual, two-dimensional data, such as pictures of our 2D Biosensor is the assembly of time series.
To efficiently process the pictures taken by our WatsOn device, we programmed this software to automatically recognize timestamps from filenames.
Using the Timeseries Labeller
After files have been loaded into the software, the user can define a label that will appear on all pictures. The automatically recognized timestamps can be manually edited and the unit. The desired size of each frame can be adjusted before the images are processed.
After the files have been processed, they can easily be used to assemble a movie, or animated GIF with readily available tools.
Here, we provide both the executable and the sources as a single ZIP-file:
