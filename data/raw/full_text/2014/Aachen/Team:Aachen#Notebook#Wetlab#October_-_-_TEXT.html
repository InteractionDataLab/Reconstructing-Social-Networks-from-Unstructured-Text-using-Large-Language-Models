Prepartations for sensor-chip production the following day (2014-10-02) was done accoringly to the sensor-chip manufacturing protocol :
At 18:30 we prepared over-night cultures from K1319042, B0015 and K131026 by inoculating 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks each containing 50 ml LB medium . The flasks were incubated for ~12 hours at 37°C on a shaker.

At 8:30, we did a plasmid prep of dublicate samples of K1319011 clone #1 and #6. We measured the DNA yield, and the higher concentrated sample of clone #1 and #6, respectively, were sent in for sequencing.
made precultures and a master plate of 6 colonies of K3139008 in psB1C3 in NEB10β cells that had been plated at 5:30 this morning.
Production of sensor-chips was done accordingly to sensor-chip manufacturing protocol . Briefly:
At 10:00 we prepared 150 ml 1.5% (w/v) LB+agarose solution. The LB+agarose solution was autoclaved and subsequently tempered to 45°C. Precultures (50 ml each) of K1319042, B0015 and K131026 were spun down at 3000 g for 10 min at 21°C and re-suspended in 1 ml pretempered (21°C) LB medium. The re-suspended cultures were mixed with 50 ml LB+agarose and poured onto three sensor-chip-templates (one template per culture). Sensor chips were cut out from the template and incubated at 37°C for 1 h.
K1319042 and B0015 were induced with 0.2 µl IPTG (100 mM) subsequently to incubation and K131026 was induced with 0.2 µl homoserinlacton stock solution (500 µg/ml) 30 minutes after induction of the K1319042 and B0015. The induced sensor-chips were read out every 30 minutes for 180 minutes in total. An additional readout was conducted 285 minutes post induction. The readout was done at 450 nm and 480 nm wavelength.

Production of sensor-chips was done accordingly to the sensor-chip manufacturing protocol :
At 13:30 we prepared sensor chips from pre-cultures of B0015, K1319017 and K131026.
Subsequently to 1 h icubation at 37°C B0015, K1319017 and K131026 were induced with 0.2 µL homoserinlacton stock solution (500 µg/ml).

At 23:30 we prepared liquid cultures from K1319015-pSB3K3 clones #7, #8 and #9 in 5 mL LB-medium. Kanamycin was used as antibiotic and the cultures were incubated at 37°C. Purpose of the cultures was cryo stock preparation and plasmid prep.

Purpose for the cultures was the characterization of constituitive expression and an additional plasmid prep of K139013-pSB3K3 and K139014-pSB3K3.
Production of sensor-chips was done accordingly to the sensor-chip manufacturing protocol :
At 13:00 we prepared sensor chips from shake flask pre-cultures of BL21 pSB1C3-K1319008+pSB3K3-K1319014, BL21 pSB1C3-K1319008+pSB3K3-K1319013 and NEB pSB1C3-B0015.

The induced sensor-chips were read out every 30 minutes for 360 minutes in total. K1319013 was induced earlier and thus measurements were taken for 450 min in total. Readout was conducted at  480 nm wavelength. An additional readout was conducted next day at 11:00.

At 22:20 we prepared 1 L LB+C plates (2.5 g NaCl, 10 g Agar, 2.5 g yeast extract and 5 g Trypton). N-Z-amine (peptone from casein) was used instead of tryptone, because the tryptone stock was depleted.
prepped multiple cultures K1319013 in pSB3K3 and K1319014 in pSB3K3. Now we have sufficient amount of both plasmids.

To determine whether the conducted Gibson assembly of K1319021 and subsequent transformation into E. coli NEB 10β were successful, a colony PCR on these cells was performed. Primers binding to each of the templates used for Gibson assembly were used: LasI_Insert_F binding in J23101.B0032.C0079.B0015.J64010.B0034 and K1319004_Check_R binding in pSB1C3-K1319008. Bands at 1341 bp would indicate the successful construction and transformation of K1319021.
Check PCR on K1319021
(Homoserinlactone-inducible expression of the TEV protease)
Since Bands >2000 bp were observed, another PCR was performed by using primers binding upstream and downstream of the insert in pSB1C3: G00100_alternative and G00101_alternative. Here, bands with a length of 2210 bp would verify the correct length of K1319021.
6th
made a SDS page of K1319010-15 and J23101.E0240
made a master plate at 15:30 containing two clones of K1319015 plate from yesterday.
At 22:00 we inocculated two 500 ml flasks containing 50 ml LB-medium with 1 ml pre-culture of K1319017, which had been prepared from a master-plate earlier this day. Chloramphinicol was used as antibiotic. The flasks were incubated at 37°C. One culture (50 ml) was induced with 25 µg homoserinlacton after an OD of 0.6 was reached and the induced culture as well as the control were used for fluorescence characterization. Fluorescene and OD were monitored once per hour. The OD of the induced culture stagnated at ~0.7 while the non induced culture grew further.

Two conducted colony PCRs confirmed that our double plasmid systems of K1319008 and K13190013/14 contain nothing but the desired BioBricks, which were used as positive controls.
