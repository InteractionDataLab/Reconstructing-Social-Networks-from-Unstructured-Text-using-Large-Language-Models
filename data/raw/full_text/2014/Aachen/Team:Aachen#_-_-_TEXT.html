Mr Holmes
Cellock Holmes - A Case of Identity
Welcome to the iGEM Aachen 2014 Wiki!
Until now, an ideal method to detect pathogenic bacteria is still elusive. The existing techniques require expensive equipment, trained personnel or labourious routines.
We, the iGEM team Aachen, have developed a '''novel biosensor system''' called ''Cellock Holmes'' that '''detects bacteria on solid surfaces''' using a low-cost, rapid and portable technique.
In this project, we demonstrate a unique way of combining '''Open Source biology, software and hardware'''.
