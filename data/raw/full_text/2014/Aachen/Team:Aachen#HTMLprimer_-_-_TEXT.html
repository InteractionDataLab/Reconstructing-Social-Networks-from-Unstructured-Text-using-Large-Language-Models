iGEM 2014 HTML Primer
everything a biologist 1 needs to know
You will find an empty template of our website always here . Please do not alter that version. You can see who altered a file the last. So ^_^ beware!
Also for our all convenience, please restrict yourself to only edit text inbetween the following tags. If you happen to edit something other this is at your own risk, and most likely you will have to repair it on your own.
<!--====================================================================--> <!--====================================================================--> <!--==================== TEXT STARTS HERE ==============================--> <!--===================== TEXT ENDS HERE ===============================--> <!--====================================================================--> <!--====================================================================-->
Please do not alter any of the include files like footer or header!
As a general side note. In HTML you must have (requirement!) a closing tag (</something>) for each opened tag (<something>)! I highly recommend to write the closing tag directly when you open a tag. That way you don't forget to add the closing tag ;). Also write the closing tags in the reverse order of the opening tags (just like the order of DNA): <a> <b> </b> </a>
There is the possibility to use MediaWiki syntax within the text area. Therefore simply change the above code to
<!--====================================================================--> <!--====================================================================--> </html> <!--==================== TEXT STARTS HERE ==============================--> <!--===================== TEXT ENDS HERE ===============================--> <html> <!--====================================================================--> <!--====================================================================-->
but please keep in mind you shouldn't ask Markus to repair anything that's broken by using MediaWiki-Syntax. Known volunteers are so far: Michael. Reverse argument: If you break anything in the opened HTML-scope, feel free to ask Markus.
Structuring your text
HTML knows some structuring elements. This section will tell you something about headings and paragraphs.
In HTML it is fairly easy to create a header. You can use the <h1> tags, where <h1> creates the biggest header, and <h6> is the smallest.
For creating line breaks simply use </br> - no opening tag is needed!
As in every scientific publiction you should not use too many line breaks. If you start a new paragraph, open a new paragraph instead.
Paragraphs, as in continuous text, should be within the <p> ... </p> tag.
Therefore a section in HTML could look like:
<h1>Big Header</h1> <h4>Small header (subcaption)</h4> <p> Introduction text ... </p> <p> Some other, unrelated text. </p> <!-- TEXT ENDS HERE -->
Including Floats into your text
Including floats (figures, tables, etc.) into HTML unfortunately is not as straight forward as, for instance, in \LaTeX. Let's start with the least complicated stuff, and then get more involved. Therefore first we're linking websites, then including images, then tables and figures.
Linking (other) websites
In HTML there's no distinction between linking to some place on your own website, or to a foreign website. Everything uses the same construct (thank god!) which starts with <a ...></a>.
<a href="address">text</a>
The address is either the name of an object (header, paragraph, block, ...) or the URL of a website, for instance https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen/. If you link to any of our sub-pages, please use the full URL. The text within the tag is the clickable link. You should keep that as short as possible, but as long as necessary!
Therefore a link to our start page would look like:
<a href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen/">link</a>
If you would like to specify the destination of the link, eg. loading in the same frame/windows/tab or in a new tab/window, you can choose between _blank for a new tab/window or _self for the current frame/window/tab.
<a href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:Aachen/" target="[_self|_target]">link</a>
Tables
Creating tables in HTML is a tedious task. Unfortunately you will most likely have quite a few tables. Therefore please use the following ( \LaTeX ) table generator , which also supports exporting the table as HTML. Use this for Excel-to-wiki conversion: here If you don't want the first row to be header-row, simply replace the <th></th> with <tr></tr>.
Please also change the start <table> to <class="contenttable"> such that the table gets represented as per our design. Consequently a table should look like:
<table class="contenttable"> <tr> <th>header1</th> <th>header2</th> <th>header3</th> </tr> <tr> <td>content1</td> <td>content2</td> <td>content3</td> </tr> </table>
header1
header2
header3
content1
content2
content3
Including Images
You can include images simply by using the following code:
<img src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/b/b5/Dnastrand3.png">
Please upload images with fileformat Aachen_descr(_date).ext on the iGEM Server . descr stands for a short description together with an optional date in any of the allowed extensions.
Position your images adequatly. In most cases you will either need to align them left, right or as center. Please try to avoid having floating images as they usually get too small to see something. Please serve yourself with the example code:
left align: <div style="text-align: left"><img src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/6/68/Aachen_Team_Logo_01.png" width="100" /></div>  center align: <div style="text-align: center"><img src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/6/68/Aachen_Team_Logo_01.png" width="100" /></div>  right align: <div style="text-align: right"><img src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/6/68/Aachen_Team_Logo_01.png" width="100" /></div>  left float: <img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/6/68/Aachen_Team_Logo_01.png" width="100" />  right float: <img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" src="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2014/6/68/Aachen_Team_Logo_01.png" width="100" />
If you want something special, google is your friend.
UPDATE: Some things changed and the template got a lot easier. Now you can simply use:
__NOTOC__ {{Team:Aachen/Header}}   = Headline = This page is awaiting synthesis.   {{Team:Aachen/Footer}}
to create a page in our wiki. If you want to use HTML do it like this:
__NOTOC__ {{Team:Aachen/Header}} <html> <h1>Headline</h1> <p>This page is awaiting synthesis.</p> </html> {{Team:Aachen/Footer}}
