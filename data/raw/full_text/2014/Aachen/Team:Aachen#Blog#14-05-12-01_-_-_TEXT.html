Blog #7 - The Biobricks have arrived
By AZimmermann 16:02, May 12 2014 (CDT)
Hello iGEM enthusiasts,
we have finally gotten the iGEM 2014 biobricks!
Now we can really start working on the molecular side of our project.
The reveal of our project, coupled with the launch of our new website will be done by the end of next week.
So stay tuned!
