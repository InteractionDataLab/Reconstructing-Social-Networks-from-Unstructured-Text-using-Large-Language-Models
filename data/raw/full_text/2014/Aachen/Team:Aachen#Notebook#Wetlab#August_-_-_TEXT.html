REACh1 gets number K1319001 and REACh2 gets number K1319002.
PCR product was restricted with DpnI 60 min at 37°C to destroy the methylated template. Then DpnI was deaktevated at 80°C during 20 min.
PCR product was purifired and transformated in DH5α.
6th

made precultures of NEB10β and DH5α cells
inoculation of the fermenter at 11:40, and induced the fermentation of pET17-Gal3. The fermentation is expected to run 24 h.
as the first Quickchange PCR for REACh2 was not sucsessful, it was reapeted as a gradient PCR with annealing temperatire 55°C, 57°C and 60°C. Then the agarose gel with PCR product samples was made.

A PCR of J23101.E0240, K1319000, K1319001, K1319002 was run and the product was separated on a 1,2% agarose gel
A SDS gel with samples of protein purification of pET17-His-SNAP-YFP-Gal3 was made to check if the purifired samples contain the target protein - YFP-Gal3. The purification or the gel resulted in two samples with a yellow color. For the SDS we also used the two samples before and the two samples after ones with the yellow color, 6 mL.

Growth in the Pseudomonas-F medium supplemented with 300 µg/L Fe3+ was weaker, however, fluorescence was also successfully suppressed.
