Mr Holmes
Notebook
During the summer, we kept record of our work in the lab and on the engineering side of our project in a notebook on this wiki. This way, members of our team can retrace what others have worked on. Moreover, you can follow the development of our project in detail.
Experiments and developments in the wetlab are documented in the "Wetlab" notebook. Here, you can find all data on our experiments concerning the biological side of our project. This notebook is organized chronologically, with one entry per day.
Under "Protocols" , you can find preparation methods of things frequently used in our experiments, such as various cultivation media, and details of procedures we regularly use, for example, transformations.
In the "Engineering" section of our notebook, our team recorded construction and circuit plans for the devices we built on our own for the project.
The Software section catalogues all the software we have developed in order to lead our project to a success.
Under Equipment you can find detailed lists of all the hardware we used in our experiments.
In the Abbreveations subpage there is a lists of all the commonly used abbreveations on this wiki you might not be familiar with.
