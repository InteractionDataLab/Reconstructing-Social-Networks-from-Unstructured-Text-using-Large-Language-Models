Collaborations with other iGEM teams
Alongside with our approaches in biology and engineering, we aimed to socialize with other teams. We gladly collaborated with several other teams throughout our whole project. As first iGEM team of the RWTH Aachen University we have plenty of things to learn, but we have to offer a lot, too.
Aachen iGEM MeetUp 2014
On September 13th and 14th all German teams were invited to attend the Aachen iGEM Meetup 2014 to share knowledge, fun and some drinks.
iGEM Meets CASLMU - Munich meetup
Early into the competition we were invited to the meetup of German iGEM teams in Munich. Arne, Markus and Michael attended the event and had a great time meeting the other iGEMers. Meeting the other teams and talking about each others problems, was also a factor in starting some of our own collaboration projects.
