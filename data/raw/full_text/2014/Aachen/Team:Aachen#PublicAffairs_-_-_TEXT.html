School projects
We are currently working together with the Kaiser Karl Gymnasium in Aachen on a school project involving the 9th Grade Biology/Chemistry class. In cooperation with Dr. Schwab we infomr the pupils about synthetic biology and our project.
This includes not only the biological background but also cool experiments we are doing together with the pupils! If you want to already get a sneak peak at these experiments check out our blog #5 - Building a website .
