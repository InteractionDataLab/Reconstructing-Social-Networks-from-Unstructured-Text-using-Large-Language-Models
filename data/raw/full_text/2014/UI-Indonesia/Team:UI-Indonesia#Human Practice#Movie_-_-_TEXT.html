How Movies Influence People?
Through your entire life, you must have watched movies--well, at least one of them. How do you feel when you watched your favorites? Surreal, right?
Watching movies and programs on the television as we relax takes us away into this different realm-—that is, there are parts in our being that feels like we are the ones in the movie. Sometimes, we even feel what the actors feel in the movies as we get caught in the emotional excitement. The effect of media does not stop when the movie or program ends. And this lingering effect might just be the cause of behavioral changes in people.
Begins with this phenomena that most people are facing, we think that somehow, people will feel and understand more about synthetic biology if we make it into a movie. For many people, synthetic biology might be horrid, scary, difficult, complicated, and so on. But through movies, we're trying to put a new point of view of synthetic biology, where people will be able to visualize the idea and creates exciting adventure in their mind.
Sooo... Don't forget to check out our own original indie movie about synthetic biology and our project in the iGEM Giant Jamboree Exhibition!
