Imagination comes without the restriction of time
Jules Verne (1828-1905) is a famous French writer, poet, and playright. He is very famous for his "ahead-of-time" books or commonly known as "science-fiction" books.
A few books worthy to be mentioned are "Around the World in Eighty Days" and "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea."
In the book he wrote
In one of his book, Robur the Conqueror, he mentioned an imaginative flying machine ahead of his time.
And soon to be realized
Wright Brother developed the "flying machine" which soon evolved into the first practical fixed-wing aircraft.
Hence our team are wondering
What we could achieve, if we are free to realize our imagination?
What will you make, if you could engineer a bacteria to do anything?
In example of making a love perfume from bacteria or even a bacteria that could sing! As we mentioned before, do not afraid to imagine something, flying was an imagination; but now, people flies.
And these are what we do!
So, these are a few of the replies we received...
“My imagination is to take a gene from chameleon that encodes color changing trait and put it in a bacteria. I hope that, as this trait is used by chameleon to  detect nearby predator, I want my bacteria adhered in my wall or the trees near my house so  I know if some predators visiting my house.”
- Ali
“My bacteria-want-to-make list: a fast wound healing bacteria, a memory enhancer bacteria, and a bacteria that can substitute a lamp and creates a never-die-lamp."
- Nurul
“Nothing more interesting than making a bacteria that can distinguish bad and good people. So, all corruptors die in a mass bacterial injection.”
- Saiful
“I want to create bacteria that can show our nerve impulse, and determine people thought/mind.”
- Nia
“Stain removal bacteria”. I have some spotted clothes which were not able to remove stain by detergents.I want bacteria which degrade pigments and remove stains from clothes."
- M.N
And a question directed back to us (?)
“Is there any bacteria that can make us invisible?”
- Jali
Or even a very cute answer!
“Bacteria with hands and legs. It’s enough.”
- Vina
CONCLUSION
Together, we have seen the wishes and hope, the imagination of the "next generation" of scientists. Well, we could not stop our anxiety on how they will start to move toward, realizing their dreams, in the future.
