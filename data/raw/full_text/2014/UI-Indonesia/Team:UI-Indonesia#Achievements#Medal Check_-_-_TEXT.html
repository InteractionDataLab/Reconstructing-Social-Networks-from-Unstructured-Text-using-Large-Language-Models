The description of our project clearly attributes work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.
We built, characterized, and documented several new and existing BioBrick parts
SILVER MEDAL
We experimentally validate more than one new BioBrick Part or Device of our own design and construction works as expected.
We documented the characterization of those parts in the "Main Page" sections of those Parts/Devices Registry entries.
We submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines)
Our projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights.We articulate several questions beyond team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within our project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.
GOLD MEDAL
We improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry. Please see the Registry help page on how to document a contribution to an existing part.
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
We outlined and detailed a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to our project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
