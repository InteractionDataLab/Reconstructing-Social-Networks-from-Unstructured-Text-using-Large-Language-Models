About Our Project
Biofilm is a matrix extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that surrounds microbial colonies and causes more than 65% microbial infections. Most of the pathogenic bacteria could make biofilm that increases their antibiotic resistance and increase its pathogenecity. Our Escherichia coli can degrade biofilm from various bacteria after it seeks them by detecting their quorum sensing signal molecule. Our team focuses in Vibrio cholerae because it causes cholera, one of the deadly tropical country disease. We present our E. coli that can degrade biofilm of V. cholerae after it detects quorum sensing signal molecule from V. cholerae, CAI-1, by CqsS receptor. Then our E. coli will activate motility gene, CheZ, to hunt V. cholerae. When it arrives, our bacteria will degrade the biofilm by secreting enzymes, such as α-amylase, nuclease, and substilisin to break down the matrix and finally secretes peptide 1018 that will kill V. cholerae.
Our project can be applied in broad application. Not only fighting the Vibrio cholerae but also the other bacteria such as: Pseudomonas aerugoinosa, Bacillus substillis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, and E. coli Top 10.
