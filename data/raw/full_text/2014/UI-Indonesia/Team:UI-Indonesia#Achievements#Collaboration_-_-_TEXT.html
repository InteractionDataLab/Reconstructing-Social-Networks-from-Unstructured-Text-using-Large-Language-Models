iGEM Nokogen
We have established a collaboration in the term of human practice with iGEM NOKOGEN team from Japan. We exchanged questionnaire from each other to be spread into the respective country.

iGEM Paris Bettencourt
The anti-smell team Paris Bettencourt have established a contact with us via Sylvia Yang in the first few week of iGEM, by asking us to joing the weekly newspaper. But after one week (yes... one!) we could not catch it in the midst of other lab things, administrative, and school! So we are very sorry to have dropped the chance to contribute in the weekly synthetic biology newspaper.
After a few months (two?) of dessertation, Aakriti then mailed one of our member to help them review and make a few annotation on their MOOC Project, aimed to help educating the high school students that are considering themself to join iGEM HS. We then make a few annotation and comments, and a little bit review and rebuttle to their arguments written in the article. We really hope to see the next improvements of the articles!
And maybe, if you are a high schoolers or someone who want to learn Synthetic Biology from scratch and a good perspective, here is the link --> http://genius.com/tags/mooc-igem-high-school
