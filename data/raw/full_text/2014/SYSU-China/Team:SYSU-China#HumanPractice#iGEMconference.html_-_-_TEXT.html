iGEM conference
There used to be several iGEM conference before the final. This year, SYSU-China participated the 2014 iGEM Conference organized by National Chiao Tung University in August 3, 2014. Five members, Mingxuan Zhang, Runwen Yao, Wei Tang, Jianhua Zeng, Dengwen Lai presented. This conference provide a platform for us to exchange ideas and experiment experiences.
Our team prepared a poster a presentation for the conference, and we successfully introduced our ideas and designs to the teams presented. Our project attracted several teams’ attention, like YMU, NCTU_Formosa, BIT, etc. We argued about some doubts in our project and this helped us to better our project. Moreover, we better understood many teams’ designs during the discussion about their project.
Apart from academic exchange, we also made a small survey about the laboratory condition of some teams. We found that the teams in Taiwan usually have better laboratory condition than mainland. Colleges in Taiwan are more willing to offer independent laboratories and funds to their teams.
