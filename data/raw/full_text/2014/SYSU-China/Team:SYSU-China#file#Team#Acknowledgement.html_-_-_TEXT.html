Acknowledgement
Lab & material support
Most of our work is finished in State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol and MOE Key Laboratory of Aquatic Product Safety, Sun Yat-sen University. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Prof. Jianguo He and Dr. Junfeng Xie for lab space and experimental equipment. Meanwhile, we got significant help from Prof. Junjiu Huang, Stem Cell and Functional genomics Laboratory, and Prof. Yongjun Lu, Molecular and Cellular Microbiology Lab. All their generous help lays the foundation of our success.
Project & idea support
Idea is the spirit of iGEM work, and a good idea should be polished by precious advice. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Dr. Junfeng Xie, Prof. Junjiu Huang (two main instructors), Prof. Yongjun Lu, Prof. Yan Zhang, and Prof. Xionglei He, and other people who generously provides suggestions on our project and idea.
Fund support
We would like to express our sincere gratitude to School of Life Science of Sun Yat-sen University, which provide all financial support for SYSU-China.
Special thanks
We got valuable advice about lab work from Shuai Jiang, Runqing Huang, Yan Shi, and Shaowei Yang, postgrad students in Prof. Jianguo He’s lab. Additionally, undergrad student Cancheng Liu from School of Software, Sun Yat-sen University took the work of writing codes for Wiki website, which saved us from lacking such knowledge. Thanks for your generous help and participation.
