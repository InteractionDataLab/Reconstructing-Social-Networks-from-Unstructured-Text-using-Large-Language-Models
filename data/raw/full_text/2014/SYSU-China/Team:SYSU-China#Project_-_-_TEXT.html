Project Description
Content
Tell us more about your project.  Give us background.  Use this as the abstract of your project.  Be descriptive but concise (1-2 paragraphs)
Current methods of high-affinity protein selection are time-consuming and laborious, which hinders the application process. This year, by constructing an integrated protein evolution machine, we made it automatic and efficient. A broad diversification was accomplished by a DNA mutagenesis module in the host bacteria, which enabled prototype protein sequence, carried by the budding-deficient M13 bacteriophage, to generate a library of candidate proteins. Subsequently, bacterial-two-hybrid system was used to give selection pressure on these candidates. Only the favorable candidate proteins can activate compensating gene transcription and rescue phage budding, thus enriching favorable protein sequence in the phage population. Moreover, an RNA thermometer, on the compensating gene mRNA, was applied in the phage amplification process to make it more controllable. Finally, by integrating all the diversification, selection and amplification process, our integrated directed evolution machine can make it an automatic and controllable process for high-affinity protein selection.

iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you though about your project and what works inspired you.

Conclusions
It's important for teams to describe all the creativity that goes into an iGEM project, along with all the great ideas your team will come up with over the course of your work.
It's also important to clearly describe your achievements so that judges will know what you tried to do and where you succeeded. Please write your project page such that what you achieved is easy to distinguish from what you attempted.
