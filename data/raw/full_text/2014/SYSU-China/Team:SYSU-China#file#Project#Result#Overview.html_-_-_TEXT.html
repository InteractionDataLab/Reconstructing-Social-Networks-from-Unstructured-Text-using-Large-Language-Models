Overview·RESULT
In the following result pages, we will show you prove of concept work and detailed procedure of constructing our system.
Because the Bacterial Two-Hybrid System is the core element in our system, we put the B2H system in the first place.  Next, by altering the reporter gene and shifting the component to destine vector, we can make an M13-B2H system. The M13 pages will tell you the rescue experiment and the integration page will show you the construction of M13-B2H system.
After the M13-B2H system is successfully constructed, we can consider adding the RNA thermometer into our system. The RANT page will tell you about the experiment result about RNAT and the integration page will show you some experiment result of the B2H-RNAT system.
The last step is to integrate the Mutagenesis part into the machine. The Mutagenesis page will tell you how we construct the mutagenesis module and how we can prove they can work.
We are working on integrating the four parts together. The Integration page will tell you how we can integrate the four parts together.
