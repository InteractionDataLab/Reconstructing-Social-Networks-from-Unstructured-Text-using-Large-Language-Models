iGEM CC
The iGEM China Community
With the motivation of better communication between teams in China, USTC and SYSU initiated an online community among teams from China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We named it iGEM China Community (iGEMCC).
Our goal
Our goal is to build an online community with all the Chinese teams. We all know that the number of teams from China is very large, which take up around a quarter of all the teams this year. That means one quarter of the iGEMers are speaking Chinese and we didn’t have an online community widely used by all Chinese iGEMers. We think that if all the team can participate in the construction processes of the community, it can become a more popular platform among all the Chinese iGEMers, and more students can benefit from this platform.
Progress
We started to contact other teams at the beginning of April and got many feedback from other teams. At first, we send an invitation letter to other teams’ contacts, inviting them to build this online community together. Many teams who joint us are very kind to contact more teams for us. Only with all the teams working together, can us able to build a QQ group for discussion with many representative from around 30 teams. So far, we have a QQ group with more than 150 iGEMers in it and the number is still growing.
Zhang Zhen (from USTC) and Liu Minsheng (from HSAAHNU_Anhui), built a website ( http://igemcc.org/ ) introducing some basic information of this iGEM China Community. Zhang Zhen (from USTC) and Han Jia (from JLU), are in charge of collecting contact information. Wu Yifan (from HIT) wrote a proposal for raising donations.
It is our honor to have many former iGEMers to give us advice. Many teams also have great ideas and very activate on the QQ group.
