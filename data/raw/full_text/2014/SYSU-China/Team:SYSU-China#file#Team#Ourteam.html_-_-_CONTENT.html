We are SYSU-China from Sun Yat-sen University. It is great fun for us to participate in iGEM-2014. This year SYSU-China has grown into a big family: 18 student members, 5 instructors, and 4 lab advisors. We are glad to communicate with dear friends from all over the world. If there is anything we can discuss about or help you, please feel free to connect us via:

She is a very lovely and optimistic girl with the sweet smile. She always brings happiness to us SYSU-China. During the experiment, the three words she loves saying are: hungry, thirsty and sleepy, but in fact, she is the most energetic one in our team. She loves biology very much and enjoys the process of iGEM. In a word, iGEM experience is dramatically brilliant for her!

Gender：male&lt;/br&gt;
Major：Forensic Medicine&lt;/br&gt;
He is a member of the team and mostly works in the mutation group. Though coming from the school of medicine, he shows great interest in life sciences, especially in synthetic biology and joined the team with the dream of creating some new kind of life. As a pretty shy boy, he shares little words but expresses a passion for doing experiments. For him, the experience of working with other team members is most precious gift for himself.

Major: Biological Technology and Application&lt;/br&gt;
Creativity not only in art but also in Biology makes me zealous to synthetic biology. iGEM can really be a great platform for all those love to create and want to become a real researcher including me. As an undergraduate student, iGEM really give me a great chance to develop myself while designing and experimenting, inside our team I mainly worked at M13 mutants’ construction and other group affairs. Working together for a same target with a brilliant team can bring a lot of fun!

I’ve been participating in lab work since the first at university. In SYSU_CHINA, I’m a member of group M13 dealing with a lot of experiments and paper works. I love playing jokes, but I think I should be more serious sometimes. Some may consider me as a nerd, actually I have lots of hobbies like photography and 20th century American literature. Since I’ll be the next captain of 2015-SYSU-CHINA, I want to learn more and make more friends this year.

I’m an undergraduate major in physics and involved in the modeling part of our project in SYSU-CHINA. I designed all the modeling work of SYSU-China, and conducted the calculation work. It is doubtlessly a tough mission, but I believe it will pay off.

Greetings, dear friends! 
I am Pai Li who participate in iGEM-2014 and also 2015 in the future as a member of sweet SYSU-China family. I love iGEM because this is the top stage of synthetic biology competition, where inspiration mingles perspiration as a proof of honor and precious memory. I am an outgoing person who love to bury myself in life science, and perhaps anime or galgames as well. In a word, iGEM experience is dramatically brilliant!

In the Sun Yet-Sen University, there is a lovely boy from Sichuan province who is energetic and naughty, smart and gifted. He immerses himself in exploring the world of science, with curiosity and insistence. Now you know I'm the boy and my name is Qiang He; I speak for myself. Thank you.

Name：Qianbin Zhang&lt;/br&gt;
Gender：Female&lt;/br&gt;
Major：Biological technology and application&lt;/br&gt;
Many friends love to describe me as “tiny”, because I have a baby face and am rather tiny in height. However, I always try my best not to think tiny and do tiny things, especially in my dreamland of science. But everything has to start out tiny, so I joined iGEM, where students at the same age with me think and cooperate and make things out step by step. This year, as I just joined in, I mainly participated in the Interlab study. 
In college, I do not stay in labs only. I am the vice captain of our department’s girls basketball team and I am also an actress in the school’s drama club. 
I would be very happy if I can make friends with many other participants here. I hope I can harvest not only knowledge and experience but also friendship and unforgettable memories.

It’s an unforgettable experience for me to conduct the interlab study as my first iGEM task. I hope that my partners and I will present a wonderful iGEM project in 2016.

Gender：Male&lt;/br&gt;
Major：Biological Science&lt;/br&gt;
I am a sophomore in the bioscience major this year. In 2014_SYSU_China,I performed part of the experiments of interlab-study. I’m fascinated about the interaction between pathogens and their hosts, especially the response of the innate immune system. 
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Lab_Advisors_of_SYSU-China">Lab Advisors of SYSU-China</SPAN></H2><P>&lt;img src =&quot; &quot; align =&quot;right&quot;&gt;</P><P>
Yan Shi, Runqing Huang, Shaowei Yang, and Shuai Jiang are our lab advisors. As postgrads who are already familiar with our lab and operation, they are generous to help us with experimental methods, instrument operation, and little tips. During our project, they taught us with skills such as cloning operation, bacteria culture, and M13 infection, which initiated our practical work. Honestly, we were impossible to finish our work without their support. Thanks for their guidance!
