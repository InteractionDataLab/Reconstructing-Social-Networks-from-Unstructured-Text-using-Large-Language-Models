About SYSU-China
Greetings everyone!
We are SYSU-China from Sun Yat-sen University. It is great fun for us to participate in iGEM-2014. This year SYSU-China has grown into a big family: 18 student members, 5 instructors, and 4 lab advisors. We are glad to communicate with dear friends from all over the world. If there is anything we can discuss about or help you, please feel free to connect us via XXXXX.
Acknowledgement:
