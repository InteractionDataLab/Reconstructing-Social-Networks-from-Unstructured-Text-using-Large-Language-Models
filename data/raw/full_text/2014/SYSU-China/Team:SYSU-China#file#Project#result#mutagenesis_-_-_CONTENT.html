The mutagenesis plasmid’s structure has </P><P>been described in Design-Mutagenesis and we specifically aim to confirm that:</P><P>1）All functional genes mutagenic genes can be expressed in our system.</P><P>2）This device can remarkably increase the mutation rate of target sequence. </P><P>3）(In the future) The functionality of this device can be activated or deactivated at proper stages, and work in tune with B2H </P><P>system and M13 proliferation cycle, further conducting directed revolution.</P><P>Our work are as follows:</P><P>Obtaining functional genes</P><P>The four primitive genes dnaQ, umuD, umuC, and recA are obtained from genome of E. coli BL21 (DE3) by PCR and transferred into pMD-</P><P>19T. The reason for using pMD-19T is to make the following procedures easier to be carried out. Using quick-change PCR (see Fig-2), </P><P>we conducted point-mutations on dnaQ and recA and obtained dnaQ926 (D12A, E14A) and recA730 (E39K). For recA730, two synonymous &lt;p&gt;mutations were performed additionally to delete the inherent restricted enzyme recognition sites EcorI and PstI. UmuD’ was the N-&lt;p&gt;term (4-72bp) truncated umuD.
</P><P>We checked the plasmids by PCR to make sure functional genes have been inserted. The agarose gel electrophoresis result is showed &lt;p&gt;below. All genes have been confirmed by sequencing. 
</P><P>Expression test of mutagenic genes
</P><P>After we had got the four mutagenic genes, plac (BBa_R0010) was chosen as the promoter in our expression vectors. RFP was used to </P><P>test whether genes were expressed. Specific operation method is to add RFP (BBa_E1010) behind single mutagenic gene and transfer the </P><P>plasmid into BL21. Testing RFP fluorescence (480nm/510nm), the positive index indicated the successful expression of our genes.
</P><P>The plasmid structures are as follows: 
</P><P>plac + RBS (BBa_B0034) + mutagenic gene + RBS + RFP (BBa_E1010) 
</P><P>We planned to express four mutagenic genes on one single plasmid, so we also constructed a test vector as follows:
</P><P>plac + RBS + mutagenic gene + RBS + mutagenic gene+ RBS + mutagenic gene+ RBS + RFP
</P><P>Pure liquid LB broth was chosen as blank control.
</P><P>In the future, we plan to test these mutagenic genes combined with more inducible promoter pbad (BBa_I13453) and RBS with different </P><P>intensities.
</P><P>Test of evolutional mutation
</P><P>All together, the four mutagenic genes should induce obvious DNA mutation. In order to test such mutation, we use RFP as mutation</P><P>target. As showed in Fig-3, we constructed the mutagenesis plasmid, pSB1A2 with similar Plac, RBS and all four genes as polycistron.</P><P>The reporter plasmid to be mutated is pSB1C3 with constructive promoter BBa_J23100, RBS and RFP. Then we co-transformed both</P><P>plasmids into E. coli ER2738, a strain able to be infected by M13. After cultivation of positive red strains in LB (with Amp and Cm)</P><P>solution, the diluted bacteria was spread on LB plate with Amp and Cm. If white strains, rather than red, are observed (which </P><P>indicates RFP chromophore is mutated), pick out the white strains and sequence the promoter and RFP to confirm whether it is exactly </P><P>mutated.
</P><P>Module and simulation of the mutation rate
</P><P>For the DNA polymerase III proof-readingε-subunit, DNAQ926 works by competition mechanism. We have constructed a module to simulate</P><P>the mutation rate when the two kinds of subunits (wild-type and mutant-type) both exist in E.coli.
</P><P>As reported, the mutation rate of well-functioned DNA polymerase is〖10〗^(-10), while that of the proofreading-defected one is </P><P>〖10〗^(-5).For there is no significant functional difference between the defective and non-defective polymerase but mutation rates,</P><P>we calculate the average mutation rate with formula as follows:
</P><P>We assume that the number of DNAPIII is 15 as it’s ranged from 10 to 20 in E.coli. The mutation rate changes as below when the </P><P>number of defective polymerase varies from 1 to 40.</P><DIV class="printfooter">
