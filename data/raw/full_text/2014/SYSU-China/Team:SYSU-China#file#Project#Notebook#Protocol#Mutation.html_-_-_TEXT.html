2. Pick the red clones and add in Amp+ plus Cm+ LB, add IPTG, culture in 37℃ overnight.
3. Dilute the bacterium solution and spread it on LB plate. Incubate overnight, dilute the rest liquid LB to 1:1000 with new one and continue to culture.
Count and pick the white clones, confirm the mutation by DNA sequencing.
