Safety form
About reconstructed M13 bacteriophage
The phage M13 bacteriophage we use specially infects E.coli containing F plasmid. In our project, the reconstructed defective M13 bacteriophage vector loses one of its core gene which is necessary for phage generation. This design fundamentally prevent the defective phage from bleeding itself. So we don’t need to worry about the genetic drift problem here. In consideration with industry safety problem, this design truly has advantages in all dimensions.
About reconstructed bacteria
Our laboratory has a strict process dealing with abandoned medium, the medium culturing conventional bacterias would be sterilized before being discarded. For high-mutation-rate strains, there are three step dealing with it.<bl /> -High pressure steam sterilization<bl /> -Alkali treatment<bl /> -Acid neutralization<bl /> Besides, the expression of bacterial two-hybrid system and RNA thermometer are regulated by IPTG and L-Arabinose respectively, so the genes we inserted can’t be expressed without laboratory condition.
