Team:Korea U Seoul/sample
From 2014.igem.org
The main objective of our project is to construct a novel “protein whip” platform, with which we can make Corynebacterium glutamicum to express other corynebacterium’s pili structure comprised of chains of a protein of our choice. As our first try, we decided to make pili made out of green fluorescence proteins (GFP); in order to do so, we substituted SpaA protein, one of the surface proteins in the Pilin A gene cluster, into green fluorescence protein, and transformed a vector containing the modified Pilin A gene cluster into a C. glutamicum strain.  Our “protein whip” platform is expected to have many practical applications. For example, pili made out of an enzyme, enzyme whip will enable the reaction to take place with high efficiency, for a great number of the enzyme included in the pili will be able to “attack” the reactants simultaneously. Biofilms made of strains of bacteria that express pili comprised of chains of specific amino acids such as histidine or cysteine that readily bind to heavy metals may be utilized to purify water contaminated with heavy metals.  Having a number of potential applications is not the sole merit of our project; by using C. glutamicum instead of widely exploited Escherichia coli, our project also contributes to expanding model organisms used in synthetic biology beyond E. coli.

There are a few wiki requirements teams must follow:
All pages, images and files must be hosted on the 2014.igem.org server .
All pages must be created under the team’s name space.
As part of your documentation, keep the links from the menu to the left.
Do not use flash in wiki code.
The iGEM logo should be placed on the upper part of every page and should link to 2014.igem.org .
Visit the Wiki How To page for a complete list of requirements, tips and other useful information.
Tips
We are currently working on providing teams with some easy to use design templates.
In the meantime you can also view other team wikis for inspiration! Here are some very good examples
2013 SDU Denmark
2013 SYSU China
2013 Shenxhen BGIG ATCG
2013 Colombia Unianades
2013 Lethbridge
For a full wiki list, you can visit iGEM 2013 web sites and iGEM 2012 web sites lists.
This wiki will be your team’s first interaction with the rest of the world, so here are a few tips to help you get started:
State your accomplishments! Tell people what you have achieved from the start.
Be clear about what you are doing and what you plan to do.
You have a global audience! Consider the different backgrounds that your users come from.
Make sure information is easy to find; nothing should be more than 3 clicks away.
Avoid using very small fonts and low contrast colors; information should be easy to read.
Start documenting your project as early as possible; don’t leave anything to the last minute before the Wiki Freeze. For a complete list of deadlines visit the iGEM 2013 calendar
Have lots of fun!
