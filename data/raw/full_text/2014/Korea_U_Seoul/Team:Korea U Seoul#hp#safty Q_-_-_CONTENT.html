                    Simple Protocols
                </DIV><DIV class="a">
					Experiments were performed in the lab of the Dept. of Biotechnology at Korea University. The lab is confirmed to the standards for bio-safety 1 which is suitable for working on agents that are not known to cause diseases in immune-competent adult humans. Works are conducted on open bench or clean bench using standard microbiological practices. Special containment equipment or facility design is not required, but may be used as determined by appropriate risk assessment techniques. Laboratory personnel must have specific training in the procedures conducted in the laboratory and must be supervised by a scientist with training in microbiology or a related science.

                    Simple Questions
                </DIV><DIV class="q">
                    1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
                </DIV><DIV class="a"><OL type="A"><LI>Researcher Safety</LI>
                            EtBr: Ethidium bromide is used as a fluorescent tag for gel electrophoresis in our lab. EtBr is known to negatively affect important biological processes, such as DNA replication and transcription, because it intercalates and deforms double-stranded DNA. Though we wash our agarose gels with EtBr solution, we strictly make sure that the solution does not make contact with human body by wearing gloves when handling the solution. The gels are safely discarded according to the safety guideline provided by the university. <LI>Public Safety</LI>
                            Genetically modified bacteria are strictly prevented from being released out of the lab.
                        <LI>Environment Safety</LI>
                            We strictly follow the safety guideline provided by the university to take appropriate means of safely discarding all experiment waste.
					</OL></DIV><DIV class="q">2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the Registry? how did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams learn from your experience?
                </DIV><DIV class="a"><OL type="A"><LI>Did you document these issues in the Registry?</LI>
							Yes
						<LI>How did you manage to handle the safety issue?</LI>
							Our project includes transforming modified Pilin A gene cluster from <I>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</I> into <I>Corynebacterium glutamicum</I> to express pili with the genetically modified <I>C. glutamicum</I>. Toxin-emitting strain of <I>C. diphtheriae</I> can cause diphtheria by adhering to the nasopharyngeal tract with their pili and emitting toxin, which causes symptoms, such as sore throat and fever. Our team is well aware of the pathogenicity of <I>C. diphtheriae</I>, but we have definitely made sure that our experiments are safe and do not cause any threats to biosafety. First of all, we are using only a part of the genomic DNA of <I>C. diphtheriae</I>, NOT the whole organism. <I>C. glutamicum</I>, into which we are transforming DNA parts of <I>C. diphtheriae</I>, is a completely non-pathogenic species and does NOT express virulent toxin that causes diphtheria symptoms. Also, we do not use <I>C. diphtheriae</I> pili as it is but instead substitute the original pilin protein into other proteins, such as GFP. Furthermore, we are by all means following the biosafety guideline provided by Korea University and KCDC about dealing with the <I>C. diphtheriae</I> genomic DNA parts.
					</OL></DIV><DIV class="q">3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution? If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project? If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?</DIV><DIV class="a">
					 Yes, our project is under the supervision of Korea University Safety &amp; Security Team. The team has raised no safety issue regarding our project.
