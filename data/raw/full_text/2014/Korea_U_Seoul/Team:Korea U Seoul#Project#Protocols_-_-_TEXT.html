Experiment Methods
Our experiments consists of 2 parts, the pili display and the GFP pili display. First we expressed pili on Corynebacterium glutamicum to see whether this is possible, and then we tried to insert the GFP into the subunit to confirm the possibility of protein display. We also tried to measure the amount of pili that has been produced.
Gibson assembly was used to assemble the plasmids.
1. pili expression in Corynebacterium glutamicum
pEKEx2-pilin A gene cluster, E1
pEKEx2-pilin A gene cluster, E1 is a plasmid that has pilin A gene cluster insert and pEKEx2 shuttle vector.
* Method of pili A expression
Design PCR primers
PCR of pilin A gene cluster with 5’ & 3’ overhang that matches pEKEx2 vetcor’s corner from genomic DNA of Corynebacterium diphtheriae
PCR of pEKEx2 with 5’ & 3’ overhang that matches pilin A gene cluster insert’s corner
Gibson assembly of two PCR products, pilin A gene cluster PCR products & pEKEx2 PCR products
- Then we can make a gibson assembly products, pEKEx2-pilin A gene cluster, E1
Transformation gibson assembly products into E.coli DH5a for amplification
Plasmid prep & Transformation E1 into C. glutamicum ATCC 13032
- Then we can make C.glutamicum that has pili A
Result of E1
(left : C. glutamicum-pEKEx2, Right : C. glutamicum-E1)
We made E1 and expressed it in the cell, which resulted in aggregation of the cells. The aggregation seems to have occured by the pili production.
2. GFP pili expression
To ascertain the formation of the GFP pili we designed 2 controls, each expressing GFP pili and GFP only. The following is the structure of the spa A gene.
(spa A gene structure : Hung Ton-That, Luciano A. Marraffini and Olaf Schneewind, Sortases and pilin elements involved in pilus assembly of Corynebacterium diptheriae, Molecular Microbiology (2004) 53(1), 251-261)
We tried to make the GFP pili by inserting GFP into the known handling site of the spa A gene.
pEKEx2-GFP pili, E2
pEKEx-GFP pili, E2 is a plasmid that has modified pilin A gene cluster by inserting GFP into spa A and pEKEx2 shuttle vector.
* Original method of GFP pili expresssion
Design PCR primers

PCR of GFP with 5’ & 3” overhang that matches corner of spa A middle part that is converted by GFP

We already designed the experiment but we did not have enough time to go through cloning.
E.coli Methods
1. E.coli Competent Cell Preparation and Transformation
Preparing the competent cells.
Reagent: TSS (Transformation and Storage Solution for chemical transformation)
85 % LB medium
10 % PEG (wt/vol, MW 8000)
5 % DMSO (vol/vol )
50 mM MgCl2 (pH 6.5)
Autoclave or filter sterilize. Store at 4 oC for < 2 weeks.
Streak the cell stock on a LB plate (added antibiotic if cells have antibiotic resistant). Incubate the plate at 37oC overnight.
Pick a single, well-isolated colony and inoculate it into 5 ml of LB broth (plus antibiotic). Incubate at 37 oC overnight with shaking at 220 rpm.
Transfer 1 ml of the saturated overnight culture to a sterile 500-ml flask containing 100 ml of LB medium (do not add antibiotic at this step). Incubate the cells at 37 oC with the shaking at 220 rpm, until OD600 reach 0.5 ; this usually takes 2.0-2.5 hr. Check the OD frequently when it gets beyond 0.2 to avoid overgrowth.
When the culture reaches an OD600 of 0.5, chill the flask on the ice for 20 min and then collect the cells by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 oC.
Resuspend the cells in 10 ml of ice-cold TSS solution. Now the competent cells are ready to be transformed.
Aliquot 150 ul competent cells to 1.5ml tube. If they are not immediately used, cells can be stored at 4 oC for maximum of 6 hr without significant loss of competency. The same competent cells can also be stored at -70 oC for long-term storage (pre-treat with liquid nitrogen or dry ice).
- (p.s.) Competent cells should give a minimum of 1x106 transformants per ug of plasmid DNA. Transformation frequency of frozen cells is 30 % of that of the fresh cells, when used within two months.
Transforming the cells.
Add DNA (under 20 ul  ) to ice cold 150 ul competent cells.  Thaw -70 oC competent cells at 0oC. (You can transform smaller portions of cells (eg. 75 ul or 50 ul), but you should decrease the volumes of DNA and media proportionately.)
Incubate on ice for 30 min. with occasional mix.
Heat shock at 42 oC for 2 min.
After heat shock, put on ice for 2 min.
Add 0.8 ml LB broth.Many transformation protocols indicate that you should allow cells to recover in SOC (2% Bactotryptone, 0.5% Bacto yeast extract, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MgSO4, 20 mM glucose).  I think this improves the number of colonies you get.
Shake and incubate at 37oC for 60 min. ( you can put 1.5 ml tubes in a big container or breaker to shake)

Transfer 1 ml of the saturated overnight culture to a sterile 500-ml flask containing 100 ml of LB medium. Incubate the cells at 30 oC with the shaking at 220 rpm, until OD600 reach 1.75 ; this usually takes more than 6 hr.
When the culture reaches an OD600 of 1.75, chill the flask on the ice.
- All procedure must be taken at 0 oC, and centrifuge must be taken at 4 oC after OD600 reaches 1.75
Collect the cells in sterilized Falcon tube by centrifugation at 3600 rpm for 10 min at 4 oC.
Resuspend the cells in 20ml of cold TG buffer. (In this period, collect all cells in one tube)

Resuspend the cells in 1ml of cold 10% glycerol. Now the competent cells are ready to be transformed.
Aliquot 150 ul competent cells to 1.5ml tube. If they are not immediately used, cells can be stored at at -80 oC for long-term storage (pre-treat with liquid nitrogen or dry ice).
