Minseob Yoo
Wassup? I’m Jade Minsub Yoo, the leader of 2014 Korea_U_Seoul. I mainly take charge of the project and overall activity, ok? I do everything like a nutbag. Our theme of the project is rejoicing, glittering, and scrupulous. It freakin’ rocks, tout court. (Details are in the project description) I’m so freakin’ ready to enjoy the grand festival or whatever. Peace!
Juyoung Han
Hello! I’m Ju-young Han of department of life science, Korea University. I have a deep interest in biology and I’m trying hard to learn more. I’m in charge of clerking and being a house elf.(I mean dobbie. Not Kreacher.) I took part in last year iGEM but this year’s giant jamboree excites me a lot! Good luck, guys!

Hello. I’m Jihee Park. I’m 20 years old and I’m in my junior year in the department of life science, Korea University. I’m in charge of presentation and design of our team. I can’t wait to meet you all. Sharing each other’s cultures and ideas about synthetic biology, I think it’s wonderful. See you guys in Boston. Till then, take care!

Hi, I’m Kyujin jeong of Korea_U_Seoul. I know that nobody is interested in me, so I won’t bother writing this. See ya, my friends.
Eugenie Choi
Hello, world! My name is Eugenie Choe, and I am a 1st-year pre-med student at Seoul National University. I have been profoundly interested in science, especially biology, since I was a little child. My lifetime goal has always been being a researcher who can make an everlasting impact on the progress of science. For me, participating in iGEM has been a very meaningful preparation for my career as a scientist and a vibrant experience of sharing my interest with the rest of the world. This is my third time participating in iGEM, but this year's iGEM is special for me, because it is my first time in the collegiate division of iGEM. I am very excited to meet everyone! See you in Boston. Enjoy!
