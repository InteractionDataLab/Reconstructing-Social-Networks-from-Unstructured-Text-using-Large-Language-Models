2014 IGEM 1st minutes
Meeting
- First meeting with 2014 kuas team members. Discussed about what is kuas, synthetic biology and igem.
Information
- Synthetic biology homepage : http://syntheticbiology.org
- Part legistry page : http://part.igem.org
Homework
- investigate about subject of2008, 2009 igem teams investigate about subject of 2008, 2009 igem teams
2014 IGEM 2nd minutes
Study of igem 2008~2009 colleges
Minseob - cell to cell communication
- Outer membrane vesicles (OMV) : gram negative bacteria like E. coli have Outer membrane vesicles (OMV), which can transfer toxin to other bacteria or host strains. Omv is composed of bi-lipid layer with water soluble core, so it can transfer both water soluble materials and lipid soluble materials. Omv is a strong candidate in long-distance messaging.
Hyeyeong -sensitivity tuners, color generator
- Different color expression by density
Juyoung –biosensor by density
- Check the expression by density divided strong, wild, weak Lock & key, Jammer
Heonsong – estimating stress by promoter & microorganism which can produce materials when get some light.
- Formation of hybrid-promoter, light-sensing, biomaterial production
Jihee- Biothermometer using RNA, not protein
- RNA double helix come untied when increase the heat.
Kyugin- treat for kidney disease
- using NhaA, Urea sensor
Tips of instrutor
Categorize the theme.
Regulate the level.
Refer other colleges access methods.
Discussion of direction
Take category- one of food/energy, environment, manufacturing.
Investigate some ideas food & energy part until 2013.12.23
2014 IGEM 4th minutes
Study presentation
JUYOUNG
- Siderosphore : Fe3+ absorb, high reducing agent. =>use ocean microbes to greenhouse effect, pathogen control, biofuel
- Degradation Aplatoxin
MINSEOB
- GABA  :  neuro-material.
- T3SS(Type 3 secretion system) : related to plant immunity. Mechanism has been found.
- Pathogen microorganism sensor : use metabolic product as marker like enterotoxin or virulence factor
- PCN(antifungal product)
- Shiga toxin producing E. coli : can develop to cell to cell communication. Herein.
- checker of cosmetics: ex) PH sensor
JIHEE
- dye : E. coli producing indigo
- Pectinase+ beta-chrotin,  E. coli producing 3-4 nutrients-> making juice
HYEYEONG
- bio-filter
- removal odors of food junks : ex)remove pathogenity.
- Soil sensor
Next week
minseob- GABA, Shiga toxin, components of cosmetics
jihee- effectiveness of making juice
hyeyeong- effectiveness of removing bad smells and probability of removing pathogenity
juyeong- about iron ion, removing ground torpedo microbes
2014 IGEM 5th minutes
About ideas
JUYOUNG
- extension of siderosphore idea
MINSEOB
- papers of Sigatoxin
JIHEE
- papers about pection production
HYEYEONG
- papers of streptomycetes, actinomycetes
Next week
kyungwoo- feedback to papers
others- get feedbacks and more study about each idea.
Schedule
Fix idea until middle of January

Presentation of ideas
JUYOUNG
- Siderophore : absorb iron ion FUR system ) Ferric Uptake Regulator.
- Aflatoxin
MINSEOB
- Shiga toxin @ shiga toxin producing E. coli: cause hemolytic-uremic syndrome (Proprotein convertases :change  proprotein to protein )
- Messages in a bubble : outer membrane vesicle (OMV)
-  Collaboration : proprotein caspases (one of serine proteases, subtilisin serine proteases) , send subtilisin to STEC  (destroyed shiga toxin will be sent to eukaryotic, but it won’t work. )
- Develop experiments of Paris
JIHEE
- pectinase production from E. coli
- Cellulase+pectinase-> more degradation of pulp
- Use residuum of fruits by pectinase
HYEYEONG
- Removing bad smells of food junks
- the main components of bad smells include nitrogen->regulate metabolism
HYUKJIN
- Cellulolytic E. coli : cellulose-> oligo-saccharides-> disaccharide -> glucose(Use ocean microbes which can degrade cellulose to disaccharides, Regulating promoter for find ultimate media.)
- Filamentus bacteria phage
- C. glutamioum: agarose fili designing: new microbes, not E. coli
Next week
Proteins which can attach to filamentus bacteria phage
