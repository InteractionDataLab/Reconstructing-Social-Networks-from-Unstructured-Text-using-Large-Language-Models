	Andrew is a sophomore at USU majoring in Biological Engineering. He is originally from Ecuador but has lived in Utah most of his life. He grew up in Salt Lake but was always more at home among the trees than among the shopping centers and prefers to do anything that will get him outdoors. When he can't get outside he loves to read Dickens, Tolstoy, Poe, Wells, or any great piece of literature. Aside from that he tries his best at sketching and 3-D modeling. He loves working in labs and especially when he has the opportunity to make something new and unique. This is his first year with iGEM but is already hooked and wants to stay involved as long as he can.
