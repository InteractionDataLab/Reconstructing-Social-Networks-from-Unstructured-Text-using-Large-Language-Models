The Undergrads
Andrea Halling
Andrea is a junior majoring in physics and biochemistry with a teaching emphasis at Utah State University. This is her third year on the iGEM team. While at USU, Andrea has been involved in undergraduate research in Dr. Miller's synthetic biology lab and Engineers Without Borders. After graduation, Andrea plans to pursue a masters in synthetic or cellular biology and would like to teach science at a small college. In her free time, Andrea loves playing lacrosse, hiking, biking, and doing pretty much anything outdoors.
Michelle Bonebrake
Michelle Bonebrake is entering her junior at Utah State University. She is studying biological engineering. She is originally from southern Utah. This is her first time on an iGEM team. She is looking for extra experience in the lab. When she’s not studying she enjoys playing video games, reading, listening and playing music, and participating in belegarth.
Sean Bedingfield
Sean is a senior in his studies of Biological Engineering at USU. He is one of USU’s undergraduate research fellows, and is acknowledged for his research in the patented manufacturing of a set therapeutics in E. coli. This is Sean’s second year as part of the iGEM competition. In his free time, Sean is an avid cook, a lover of literature, and escapist through hiking.
Andrew Parker
Andrew is a sophomore at USU majoring in Biological Engineering. He is originally from Ecuador but has lived in Utah most of his life. He grew up in Salt Lake but was always more at home among the trees than among the shopping centers and prefers to do anything that will get him outdoors. When he can't get outside he loves to read Dickens, Tolstoy, Poe, Wells, or any great piece of literature. Aside from that he tries his best at sketching and 3-D modeling. He loves working in labs and especially when he has the opportunity to make something new and unique. This is his first year with iGEM but is already hooked and wants to stay involved as long as he can.
Dallin Christensen
Dallin is a senior at Utah State University.  He is majoring in Biological Engineering with minors in both Spanish and Chemistry.  He is currently applying to medical school and hopes to become an urologist.  This is his first year competing in iGEM, and he looks forward to this fall where he will celebrate his five year anniversary, with his wife, at the Giant Jamboree in Boston.   Besides his academic activities, he loves to snowboard, ride horses, and play ice-hockey.
Ryan Putman
Ryan is a junior majoring in Biological Engineering and Biochemistry at Utah State University. He is originally from Washington and came to Utah for college. After his undergraduate degree is completed, he would like to pursue graduate school in Biological Engineering or Biomedical Sciences with the aim of working on diagnostic methods or treatments for diseases. Outside of the lab, he enjoys reading all types of scientific articles, playing basketball and chess (not at the same time), watching sports, and binging on various Netflix shows. This will be his third year participating in the iGEM competition and he is looking forward to the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
Cody Maxfield
Cody is a sophomore Biological Engineering. He is working for the summer of 2014 with the Sustainable Waste-to-Bioproducts Engineering Center producing algae harvesting prototypes and conducting water analysis for algae remediation. He also volunteers at the Metabolic Engineering Lab assisting the research in the production pathways of pharmaceutically important compounds in bacteria. When he's not working, he loves to hike and backpack in Southern Utah and the Uintah Mountains. 
Cody Maughan
Cody Maughan is a Junior at Utah State University's College of Engineering. He enjoys working with/under Dr. Hyduke doing theoretical and computational research of metabolic flux modeling. When Cody isn't studying or working, he enjoys going on dates with his wife, play soccer, and read about new technologies and theories of math and various sciences.
Sara Gertsch
Sara is currently a senior majoring in Biological Engineering and minoring in Chemistry. She is originally from Wyoming and decided to come to Utah State for the Biological Engineering program. She absolutely loves synthetic biology and hopes to pursue a graduate degree in the field. Outside of the lab, she enjoys reading, road cycling, Zumba, camping, and being with friends and family. This will be Sara's first year participating in the iGEM competition and she is really looking forward to attending the Giant Jamboree.
Graduate Advisor
Asif
Asif is the graduate adviser for this year’s iGEM team. Currently, he is pursuing his PhD in Biological Engineering at Utah State University. Asif is from Auckland, New Zealand. Outside of the lab Asif plays cricket, tennis, swimming, and soccer. He also enjoys traveling.
Instructor
Dr. Charles Miller
Dr. Charles Miller is the faculty advisor for this year's Utah State iGEM team.
About Utah State University
Logan, Utah is home of the Utah State University Aggies. Originally established as a small land grant agricultural college in 1888, Utah State University has grown to become a nationally recognized institution both for its high level of academics and athletics. Its undergraduate research program is the second oldest in the nation with more than a fourth of the undergraduate researchers involved in their own research. Utah State University continues to excel in many academic areas, especially engineering, math, and science.
