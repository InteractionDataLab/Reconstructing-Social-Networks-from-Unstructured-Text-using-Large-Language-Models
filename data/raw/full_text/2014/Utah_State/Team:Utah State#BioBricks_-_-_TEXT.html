BBa_K1418002
This part was constructed as an inducible chlorophyllase enzyme generator with a C-terminal 10x-Histidine tag to allow for simple purification using nickel affinity chromatography. Refer to our project page for background information on chlorophyllase and to our chlorophyllase results page to see how we produced, purified, and tested this enzyme.
Intermediate parts (N- to C-terminal)
K208010 – Composite part of R0010 (a lac inducible promoter) and B0034 (a ribosome binding site with 1.0 level of efficiency)
K1418001 – BioBrick encoding a chlorophyllase enzyme (TaCHL) found in Triticum aestivum, a common species of wheat. RFC 23 compatible.
K844000 – A 10x-Histidine tag used to purify chlorophyllase enzymes using nickel affinity chromatography. RFC 23 compatible.
B0015 – Composite part of two transcriptional terminators.

BBa_K1418012
This part was constructed as an inducible cellulase enzyme generator with a C-terminal 10x-Histidine tag to allow for simple purification using nickel affinity chromatography. Refer to our project page for background information on chlorophyllase and to our cellulase results page to see how we produced, purified, and tested this enzyme.
Intermediate parts (N- to C-terminal)
K208010 – Composite part of R0010 (a lac inducible promoter) and B0034 (a ribosome binding site with 1.0 level of efficiency)
K1418011 – BioBrick twin of K118023 with double stop codons removed and designed as RFC 23 compatible.
K844000 – A 10x-Histidine tag used to purify cellulase enzymes using nickel affinity chromatography. RFC 23 compatible.
B0015 – Composite part of two transcriptional terminators.

BBa_K1418061
This part was constructed to demonstrate the immobilization of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to bioplastic granules. Once this device was proven to function as expected, we were able to construct a similar genetic circuit with our stain-fighting enzymes in place of the GFP.
Intermediate parts (N- to C-terminal)
K934001 – phaCAB operon which encodes the 3 necessary enzymes in the bioplastic (PHB) pathway, preceded by native promoter. All from Ralstonia eutropha H16.
K208010 – Composite part of R0010 (a lac inducible promoter) and B0034 (a ribosome binding site with 1.0 level of efficiency).
K1418062 – Green fluorescent protein with double stop codons removed and XhoI site removed. RFC 23 compatible.
K1418060 – BioBrick encoding PHB synthase enzyme (PhaC) with double stop codon following the end of the coding region. RFC 23 compatible.
B0015 – Composite part of two transcriptional terminators.
