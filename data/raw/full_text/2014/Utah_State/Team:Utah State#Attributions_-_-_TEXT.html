Attributions
All experiments and work for this project were conducted by Undergraduate Biological Engineering students who volunteered their time in Dr. Charles Miller's Cellular Engineering Laboratory at Utah State University.
University Facilities
Thanks to USU chemistry department for allowing us to use their NMR.
Sponsors and Support
Mentors and other Assistance
We would like to thank our faculty advisor Prof. Charles Miller for his input and help. Also, we would also like to thank our graduate advisor Asif Rahman for his valuable insight. Thank you Kevin Pickett from USU Computer Science Department for helping with the wiki. Dr. Ronald Sims helped us secure funding from the Department of Biological Engineering. Dean Christine E. Hailey provided funds from the Deans office in the Faculty of Engineering at Utah State University.
The wheat (Triticum aestivum) chlorophyllase gene was kindly provided to us by Dr. Joseph Jez, Washington University, St. Louis, MO
Collaborations
Utah State 2014 Collaborations
This year our team collaborated with many groups. We helped a first time iGEM team (CSWProteens) and also worked with other collegiate teams. Our team sent BioBrick parts from past years to some teams and offered advise with experiments and safety.
1.) CSWProteens HS 2014 (Weston, MA)
Contacted us about HylA secretion system in E. coli
We gave them with cloning/design advice, supplied them with pLG575 plasmid for secretion (HylB,D)
USU grad mentor Asif Rahman was one of CSW Proteen’s official advisors

2.) DTU-Denmark 2014 (Copenhagen, Denmark)
Contacted us about a documentary on synthetic biology and its applications
We supplied them with a microscope image of spider silk from our 2012 iGEM project

3.) Yale 2014 (New Haven, CT)
Contacted us about an open collaboration because we made AMP-spider silk in 2013
They would like to conjugate AMPs with DOPA-containing peptides
( https://2014.igem.org/Team:Yale )
4.) Toulouse 2014 (Toulouse, France)
Contacted us and requested an antimicrobial peptide gene (EcAMP-1) from the Utah State 2013 project
We supplied them with the EcAMP-1 BioBrick

5.) Auckland_New_Zealand 2014 (Auckland, New Zealand)
We reached out to them to see if they needed assistance with their team, as this was their first iGEM team and the first team from New Zealand
Asif has corresponded with them and we are currently waiting on a response

6.) UCLA 2014 (Los Angeles, CA)
Contacted us about safety considerations with dissolving spider silk in HFIP
Our grad advisor Asif Rahman provided them with advice regarding handling and who to contact about other safety concerns
( https://2014.igem.org/Team:UCLA )
7.) Linkoping_Sweden 2014 (Linköping, Sweden)
Contacted us about a peanut allergy survey
We completed this survey on July 26th
