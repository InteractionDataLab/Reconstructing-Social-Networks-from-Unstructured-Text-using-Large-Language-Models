SBa_M1003: Experiment
Description
An experiment within a teaching environment may be carried out as an observational tool for participants to watch or an active experiment; if it will be participants carrying out the experiment, it is a good idea to use one that has been prepared before as it usually comes with ‘instructor notes’ with clear information and helpful tips.
It is usually a good idea to have an assistant demonstrator to be present to help with and difficulties with the logistics of the experiments and answer any questions that may arise.
A lot of planning and care needs to be taken when conducting an experiment:
1. Instructor preparation
The experiment should relate to the class content
The correct amount of time should be set aside for the experiment
The technicality of the experiment should match the class level
2. Participant preparation
The class must be given clear instructions and demonstrations before starting
Participants should also make predictions about the outcome of the experiment
3. Conducting the experiment and collecting data
There must be presence of instructors to help solve any problems and answer questions
4. Data analysis and discussion
Once the data has been collected, it is important to link the results to the initial prediction to allow participants to understand and learn from what happened
5. Assessing participant understanding
Tests and quizzes can be useful to qualify understanding
Open ended questions are good to gain an idea of what was easy, what was not to allow refinement for future class experiments
