Another aspect of our policy and practice project entailed outreach within schools to educate the next generation of scientists about synthetic biology. As this is an emerging science, these are the individuals who will be pioneering the technology and so we believed they would be the perfect target audience for our session. We carried out the outreach sessions in Porto, Portugal and Manchester, England.
