SBa_O0002: Policy Recommendation
Description
Policy recommendation is a document containing advice concerning policy that is prepared for a group of people that have the authority to make decisions. This document informs senior decision-makers about a policy-issue including in-depth analysis of the alternative options and providing a final recommendation. The effect the policy recommendation will have ( whether it is accepted or not) will depend on how well presented and justified the arguments for the recommended course of action are.
The key features of policy recommendations are:
Conciseness
Readability
Accuracy
Before producing a policy recommendation the following points should be covered:
1. Identification of the policy issue
2. Background research and context
3. Identify alternatives
4. Carry out consultation on alternatives
5. Select the best policy option
6. Prepare a policy recommendation document for approval
Policy Recommendation documents are written as a standard analytical report. The document analyses the current situation and recommends a a justified and well grounded action (policy change) that is supported by evidence. The main objective is to persuade the reader of the appropriateness of the decision that is being recommended.
