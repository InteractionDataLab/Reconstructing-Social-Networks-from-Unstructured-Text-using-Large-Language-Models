SBa_M0003: Structured Interview
Description
Structured interviews are standardised, quantitative research methods in which the questions asked are set and specific. This approach ensures that each interview has the same questions, in the same order to minimise context effects; essentially, answers are reliable and allow easier comparison between samples.
These types of interviews may be used as a qualitative research method within focus groups to compare and contrast participant responses and reactions (see SBa_M0006 for more information).
