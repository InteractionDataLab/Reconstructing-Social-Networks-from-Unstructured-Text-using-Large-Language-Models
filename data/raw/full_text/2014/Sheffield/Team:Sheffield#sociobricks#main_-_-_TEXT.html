About
Welcome to the Registry of Standard Policy and Practices Parts designed by The University of Sheffield iGEM 2014 Team.
This registry is a repository of standard SocioBrick parts which can be browsed to select components to help guide teams in the process of their human practice project initiatives.

The Concept
SocioBricks are analogous parts to BioBricks. They are a standardised approach to carrying out policy and practices projects. Teams are able to search and look through the registry to gauge what frameworks and methods they can use for particular project outputs.
The Parts
There are five main collections of parts:
– these provide a background and basis for the work you choose to do: from social research to outreach in schools.
– Some frameworks and legislation in different places around the world may require teams to take steps to ensure activities are carried out in an ethical manner.
–a diverse group of parts that encompasses strategies to accomplish the work's goals: be they answering a social question to public engagement.
– the research carried out will be subject to analysis. This may be quantitative or qualitative and relates back to the initial framework and the methods employed.
– the communication of the work done can be conveyed in several forms. In this collection, the user can find examples effective outputs from previous iGEM teams
The Approach
The parts can be mixed and matched to shape the processes of projects. For example, The University of Sheffield iGEM 2014 Team carried out a number of projects shown as constructs below:
