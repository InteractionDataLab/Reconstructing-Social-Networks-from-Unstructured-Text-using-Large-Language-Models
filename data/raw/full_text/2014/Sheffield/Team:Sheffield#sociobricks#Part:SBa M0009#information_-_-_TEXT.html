SBa_M0009: Visual Methods

1SBa_M0009: Visual Methods
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
As mentioned above, images have the ability to put across what words and numbers may fail to. The images may also be able to speak to another level of consciousness in the participant to gain a completely different view and engage them more. As this is more creative, it may help to sustain concentration and interest in the topic and widen the sample to those who find it difficult to express themselves verbally.
Limitations
Images are not neutral reflections of reality which may alter someone’s viewpoint and judgement of a visual aid.
As it is an emerging research method, it has not been characterised as well. Therefore, more limitations may crop up as it is tested and used more.
