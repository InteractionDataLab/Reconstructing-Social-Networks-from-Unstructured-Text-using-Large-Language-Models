SBa_F0001: Conflict Theory
Description
The social conflict theory is heavily based on the Marxist theory by Karl Marx (1818 - 1883); individuals and groups in society have differing amounts of material and nonmaterial resources i.e. wealthy vs. poor for which they are in competition. As a result of this, society is in conflict due to competition for limited resources and thus powerful groups use their power to exploit groups with less power. This domination and power maintains order by any means necessary, even if that means suppressing the poor and powerless. The theory is also heavily used to describe democracy and civil rights, as well as capitalism to control people.
