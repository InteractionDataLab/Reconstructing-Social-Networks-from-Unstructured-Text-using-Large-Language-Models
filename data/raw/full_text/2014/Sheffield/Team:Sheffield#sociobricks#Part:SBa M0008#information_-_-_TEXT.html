1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
The strengths of this research is the availability of tools such as citation indices to help identify key data easily. The data can also be collected for time periods from the past. It is also useful for corroboration of ideas as well exploring new papers.
It is inexpensive and highly reliable. As the data is quantitative, trends can be studied easily (see SBa_A0001)
Limitations
Citation analysis is a useful tool but is not a true measure of the quality of the published papers. Also, 50% of papers are not cited at all, but this does not mean that they have no impact whatsoever. It also takes time for citations to be collected, especially for recently published papers.
