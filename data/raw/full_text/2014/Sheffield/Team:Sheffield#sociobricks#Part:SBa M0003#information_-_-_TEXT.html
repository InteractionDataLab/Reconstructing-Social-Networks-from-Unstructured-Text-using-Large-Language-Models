SBa_M0003: Structured Interview

Strengths
As the questions are set, there is no room for accidently asking a more bias follow up question which may occur in a semi-structured interview (SBa_M0004). The questions are straight to the point to get the information you need directly.
As with all interviews, they are a good way of measuring general attitudes towards the topic from facial expressions and tone of voice alongside what is said. They are very detailed and can provide in-depth information. If the interviews are carried out over the phone or by email, there can be a quick turnaround to gain data.
If the structured interview protocol used is well constructed and tested, there is moderately high reliability and validity of data.
Limitations
In-person interviews can be very time consuming and sometimes expensive depending on where you have to travel. Poor interviewing skills may also bias the results; interviewers must maintain a neutral stance to prevent skewing the results in any way - the aim is to investigate an area, not to interrogate to get the interviewee to say what you want to hear.
Interview transcripts can take a long time to create, especially with semi-structured interviews where there is more room for follow up questions.
