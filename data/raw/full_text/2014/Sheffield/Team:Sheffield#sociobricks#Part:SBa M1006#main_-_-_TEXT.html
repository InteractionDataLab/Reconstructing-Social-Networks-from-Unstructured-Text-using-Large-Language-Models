SBa_M1006: MOOC
Description
A massive open online course (MOOC) is a recent (2012) open access, online course initiative available to any participant via the internet. It is made up of classic course materials such as videos, readings and tests. Alongside this, there are interactive forums for users to build communities for collaboration, support and Q&A.
A MOOC can last from 6 to 12 weeks and is accessible 24/7; there may be some live features such as ‘webinars’ (analogous to SBa_M1002 ) that would have to be synchronised by time. Videos that are 5-10 minutes long are used to teach a topic, the learning is then assessed by follow up, multiple choice questions. Students must also produce assignments that are evaluated by peer review or by whoever is managing the system.
