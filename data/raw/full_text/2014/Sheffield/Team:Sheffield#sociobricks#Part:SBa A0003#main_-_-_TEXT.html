SBa_A0003: Discourse Analysis
Description
Discourse Analysis studies the manners in which language is used in texts and contexts. This discipline is based on the understanding that communication between people goes beyond simple transfer of information. Discourse analysis investigates the effect of language and what is accomplished by individuals or groups of individuals through language. This field of study analyses questions such as how meaning of words are constructed in society.
Selected texts ( should be as complete as possible)  are normally the material used for discourse analysis.
When conducting a Discourse analysis you should look for the following elements in the text: 1. Hidden relations of power present. 2. Who is exercising the power 3. Who are the people that have been consulted for the article. 4. What has been left unsaid/unspecified. 5. Reifications ( use of passive voice or objects identified as things) 6. The use of adjectives/ predominantly descriptive language ( indicating strong discourse).
When carrying out this type of analysis you should attempt to identify whether a different phrasing/ wording of the information might have resulted in a different discourse being predominant.
