SBa_M0010: Case Study
Description
A case study is essentially a research method that focuses on a single case rather than a population or sample. It is descriptive and generally looks to events in retrospect. Case studies are useful when exploring ideas and preparing for a larger study in the earlier stages of research.
By focusing on a single case, researchers can make detailed observations over a long period of time, something that cannot be done with large samples without costing a lot of money, for example longitudinal research can be quite costly.
