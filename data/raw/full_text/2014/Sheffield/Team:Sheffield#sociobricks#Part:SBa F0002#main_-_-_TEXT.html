SBa_F0002: Symbolic Interactionism
Description
Symbolic interactionism is a theory that was developed based on the work of George Herbert Mead (1863-1931) and Herbert Blumer (1900-1987)  that is fundamentally grounded on the belief that people behave based on their belief and not just on what is objectively true. This theory analyses the society structure by interpreting the subjective meanings that individuals impose on objects, events and behaviours. This way, society is thought to be constructed through human interpretation.
Since most of the interactionist research uses qualitative research methods, this SocioBrick may be coupled with SBa_A1001 .
