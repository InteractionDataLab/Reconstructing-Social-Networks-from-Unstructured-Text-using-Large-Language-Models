SBa_E0001: Risk Assessment
Description
This is a document containing an assessment of what the possible consequences of your work may be i.e. whether any harm can be brought about to people, what the possible risks are that this harm may occur, and would precautions have been taken to reduce the risks.
The risk assessment is very important to document (particularly when conducting sociological research) to both protect the general public from possible harm caused by failure to take reasonable control measures but also to protect the quality and credibility of your work.
