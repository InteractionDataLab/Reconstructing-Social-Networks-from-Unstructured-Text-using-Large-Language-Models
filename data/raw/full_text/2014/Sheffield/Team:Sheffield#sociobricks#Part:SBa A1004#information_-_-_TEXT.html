SBa_A1004: Content Analysis
Contents
1SBa_A1004: Content Analysis
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
Content analysis is easy to conduct, as it does not require contact with people. It gives the user each to analyse whichever resources they find and collate, especially if there is no real theoretical framework to the research; this is particularly useful for the grounded theory.
It is also easy to replicate and therefore quite reliable.
Limitations
This method defines who, what, where, when, and how but does not discuss or identify why specific themes are recurring.
Trends may not also be feasible as if for example, news articles are being analysed, particular stories may get more coverage than others.
