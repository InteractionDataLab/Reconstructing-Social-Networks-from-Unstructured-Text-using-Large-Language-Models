SBa_A1003: Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis
Description
This is a qualitative research analysis method, which aims to understand how a person makes sense of a given phenomenon with some personal significance: for example, a major life event. This is a method of analysis that crosses over a lot with psychology and interpretation.
