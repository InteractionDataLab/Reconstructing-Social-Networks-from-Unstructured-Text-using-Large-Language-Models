1SBa_E0005: DBS Check
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
It is a legal requirement therefore it allows you to conduct your outreach with the piece of mind that you will not get into trouble by having legal action taken towards you.
A DBS check for a volunteer is free of charge.
Limitations
It takes 13-16 working days in the UK for a DBS check to come through so it must be applied for in advance.
