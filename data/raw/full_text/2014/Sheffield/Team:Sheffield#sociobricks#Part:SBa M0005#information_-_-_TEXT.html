SBa_M0005: Questionnaire
Contents
1SBa_M0005: Questionnaire
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
Questionnaires are very cheap to carry out and do not require as much effort as an interview would need when conducting verbal or telephone surveying. The standardised options also make it simple to compile and analyse data as responses fall between a range of answers.
The quick turnaround also allows several, anonymous data pieces to be collected, in comparison to interviews. The data is highly reliable and valid with well-constructed questionnaires.
Limitations
It can be difficult and time-consuming to construct an effective questionnaire, which is not leading and has a range of answers; sometimes the standard answers frustrate users as their belief or view is not on the sheet.
The response rate is usually very low if distributed by mail and email.
