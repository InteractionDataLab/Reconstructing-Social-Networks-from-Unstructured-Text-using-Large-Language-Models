SBa_M0010: Case Study
Contents
1SBa_M0010: Case Study
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
The data gained is rich and therefore more detailed than data collected say through a simple questionnaire.
It is real life and therefore does not and cannot lack mundane realism.
Case studies allow for socially unethical or impractical events to be investigated for example, the study of Genie, a feral child. It would be unethical to set up such an experiment but completely ethical to look at the findings of events like these that unfortunately do occur.
Limitations
An obvious flaw to using a case study as a research method is that the findings cannot be generalised to a large group or population, as they are only relevant to those involved.
There may be more of a concern of researcher bias, as case studies tend to be more personal as participant levels are much fewer.
It is generally very difficult to replicate a case study as it may not always be ethical.
