SBa_M0009: Visual Methods
Description
A lot of social science research relies on words and numbers and so recently, there has been an interest in going ‘beyond text’. Visual aids can include photographs, film, media images, drawings and maps just to name a few. Not all information can be reduced to text and numbers and can help to communicate what words could not say in a concise manner.
There are three main types of images that can be used:
Found images
Researcher-created images
Participant-created images (this links to SBa_O0001 BioArt which could be created)
This method is particularly good when using with younger people such as student in both research and educational settings.
