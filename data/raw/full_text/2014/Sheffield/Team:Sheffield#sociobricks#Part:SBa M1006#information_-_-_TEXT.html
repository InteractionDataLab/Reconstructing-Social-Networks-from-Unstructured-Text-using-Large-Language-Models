1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
The MOOC Guide has listed 12 key benefits of using this method:
Appropriate for any setting that has connectivity (Web or Wi-Fi)
Any language or multiple languages
Any online tools
Escape time zones and physical boundaries
Produce and deliver in short timeframe (e.g. for relief aid)
Contextualized content can be shared by all
Informal setting
Peer-to-peer contact can trigger serendipitous learning
Easier to cross disciplines and institutional barriers
Lower barriers to student entry
Enhance personal learning environment and/or network by participating
Improve lifelong learning skills
Limitations
The percentage of users who sign up and complete the entire course is approximately 10%, a very low rate so it’s success has been questioned.
Some MOOCs may lack instructional structure and may be of uneven quality which would be deemed as a limitation as they should be quite standard and accessible for all.
