SBa_O0001: BioArt
Description
BioArt is the practice of producing artworks using living organisms and life processes. The phrase BioArt was coined in 1997, by an artist called Eduardo Kac, however its origins can be traced back to the late 20th century through works from artists such as Joe Davis and SymbioticA. Like any form of art, BioArt can be intended to be purely aesthetic or can aim to provoke questions about society, nature and beyond.
