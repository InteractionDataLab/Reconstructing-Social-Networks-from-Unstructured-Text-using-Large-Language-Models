SBa_O0005: Outreach
Description
Outreach is designed to provide services or disseminate information to communities or populations who might otherwise not have access to it. All outreach activities must have the common ground of promoting social welfare.
An important aspect of outreach is that the groups providing the services must be mobile and meet those communities at their original locations (i.e: where they are in need).
