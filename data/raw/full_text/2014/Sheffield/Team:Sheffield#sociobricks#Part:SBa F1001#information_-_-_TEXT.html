1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
The learner is able to understand and create this knowledge in a way that is meaningful to them to essentially bridge the knowledge deficit.
Limitations
Giving people more information and facts regarding the new advances may not always lead to acceptance of the technologies as everyone still has the right to their own opinion; a general assumption that people will be happy after hearing the facts is incorrect.
Individual experiences and attitudes are different meaning a desired outcome may not be achieved as people approach the problem or task.
