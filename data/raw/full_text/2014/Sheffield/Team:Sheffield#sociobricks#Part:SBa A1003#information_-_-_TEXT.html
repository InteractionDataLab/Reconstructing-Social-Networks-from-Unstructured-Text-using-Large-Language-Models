SBa_A1003: Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis
Contents
1SBa_A1003: Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
It is a flexible and inductive method that is able to engage without being based on a particular framework.
Limitations
May have to re-read sections several times to make conclusions so it can be time consuming.
It is based on the readers own conceptions which may not be the general view and therefore analysis can be biased
