SBa_O0003: New Theory
Description
Sociological theories are frameworks of empirical evidence that can be applied to study and interpret social phenomena. Research conducted and supported by other case studies may prove existing theories incomplete or wrong in which case it may be relevant to develop a new theory that explains the data obtained. The new theory may provide a better explanation of aspects of social science and/or enable prediction about future events.
