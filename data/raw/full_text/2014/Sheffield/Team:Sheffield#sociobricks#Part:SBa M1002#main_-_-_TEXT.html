SBa_M1002: Seminar
Description
A seminar brings small groups of people together to focus on a particular subject; this is usually on a recurring basis so a one-off seminar may be seen as a workshop instead.
They can involve many activities. For example, you may give a small group a piece of text to read and then discuss with one another or answer questions you have set within the group. It could also involve something creative in which they have to draw or make something to represent or explain a topic you may have introduced by, for example, a lecture ( SBa_M1001 ).
At a seminar, everyone is free to participate and contribute to the discussion, debate or other activity taking place.
