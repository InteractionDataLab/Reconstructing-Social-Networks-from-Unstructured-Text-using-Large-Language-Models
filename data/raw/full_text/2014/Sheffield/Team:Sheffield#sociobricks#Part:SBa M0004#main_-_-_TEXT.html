SBa_M0004: Semi-structured Interview
Description
A semi-structured method of research in social science allows follow-up questions and new ideas to be brought up in the course of the interview depending on the responses from the interviewee. This characteristic may help the researcher to tailor the questions to the individual they are interviewing in order to make the most out of the interview. There are generally frameworks of the themes the researcher wants to explore in the interview which can be used as prompts during the interview to find out specific things.
