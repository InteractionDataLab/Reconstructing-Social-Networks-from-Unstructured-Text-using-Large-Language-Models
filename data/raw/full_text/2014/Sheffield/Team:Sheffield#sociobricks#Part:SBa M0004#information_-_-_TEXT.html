SBa_M0004: Semi-structured Interview

1SBa_M0004: Semi-structured Interview
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
The interview can be a more tailored experience and allows the researcher to prompt to divert back to the original theme and topic if the interviewee goes on a tangent. It is also useful to explore opinions as well as confirm original assumptions and themes. The language used isn’t strictly the questions initially outlined as with structured interviews (SBa_M0003) so this can also be tailored for the correct age group or type of people being interviewed.
As with all interviews, they are a good way of measuring general attitudes towards the topic from facial expressions and tone of voice alongside what is said. They are very detailed and can provide in-depth information. If the interviews are carried out over the phone, there can be a quick turnaround to gain data.
Limitations
In-person interviews can be very time consuming and sometimes expensive depending on where you have to travel. Poor interviewing skills may also bias the results; interviewers must maintain a neutral stance to prevent skewing the results in any way - the aim is to investigate an area, not to interrogate.
Interview transcripts can take a long time to create, especially with semi-structured interviews where there is more room for follow up questions.
