SBa_E0002: Ethics Approval

1SBa_E0002: Ethics Approval
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
The process of gaining ethical approval allows you to clarify the aims, process and outputs of your research. It may also cause modifications to the scale and scope of the research if, once stated in a concise manner, seem unrealistic.
Limitations
One limitation of carrying out research is your own position as a researcher which may lead to influence and bias over research subjects, for example, within your own organisation. Therefore, methods, analysis and discussion of the final results from the research on the approval form must be done carefully.
