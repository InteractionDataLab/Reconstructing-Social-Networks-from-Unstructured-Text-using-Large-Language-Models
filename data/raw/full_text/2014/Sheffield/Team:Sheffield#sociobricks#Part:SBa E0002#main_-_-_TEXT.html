SBa_E0002: Ethics Approval
Description
Ethics forms are a set of policy documents that cover topics such as data protection (recovery and storage), safety and well-being, anonymity, confidentiality, health and social care. It also states whether the research may target a vulnerable group and whether consists of an archival research, research on illegal activities or administrative research. Ethics approval is required by all staff or students who are planning to conduct research involving human participants, personal data, and human tissue. Ethics approval is also required by any other individuals who may are conducting research on university premises.
Researchers have a duty of care towards all individuals whom their research may affect and obtaining ethics approval ensures that appropriate steps have been taken to mitigate that risk; the risks would be found by carrying out a risk assessment ( SBa_E0001 ). Within the ethics approval form, it is important to ensure anonymity of the participants and state how data will be stored appropriately and securely.
This ethical stance is within a legal framework of the Human Rights Act and Data Protection Act.
