SBa_F0003: Actor-Network Theory
Description
The actor-network theory (ANT) was developed by Michel Callon and Bruno Latour in the late 1990s. It treats objects, both human and nonhuman, as parts of social networks. It maps relations between materials things as well as between concepts. It doesn’t seek to understand why a network exists, but more so the infrastructures of the actor networks, how they form and how they may fall apart.
