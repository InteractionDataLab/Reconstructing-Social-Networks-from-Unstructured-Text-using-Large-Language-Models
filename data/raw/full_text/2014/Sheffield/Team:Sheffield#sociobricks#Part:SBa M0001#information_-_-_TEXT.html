SBa_M0001: Oral History
Contents
1SBa_M0001: Oral History
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
A good oral history will provide background information and personal insights that may not be found in official documents. As the interviews are carried out with individuals, there are personal biases. However, these may be important when used for data analysis when thinking about why a person may feel this way.
Limitations
The interviewees may not want to honestly discuss the past events or remember details entirely so recollections may not be entirely truthful or accurate. As time passes since the experience, information becomes more condensed and so critical actions and judgements may be omitted during the interview.
As well as this, they can take a very long time to conduct, transcribe and analyse.
