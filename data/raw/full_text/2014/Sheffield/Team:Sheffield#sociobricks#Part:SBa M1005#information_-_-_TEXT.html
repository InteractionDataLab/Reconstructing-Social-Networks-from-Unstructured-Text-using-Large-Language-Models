SBa_M1005: Social Media

1SBa_M1005: Social Media
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
Most people have access to the internet from which they can use and view the social media platforms. The pages created on the platforms have higher reach, frequency and usability than other outreach methods. This allows you to build reputation and reach other opportunities through the contacts made that may not have been available before.
Platforms and social media are global meaning you can make links with people from across the world to increase your reach and opportunities further than you may have predicted.
Limitations
Some media platforms such as Twitter may be very fast paced causing you to miss things and also stop you keeping up with the constant demand.
The platforms may be used ineffectively. For example, using the network to push your idea without engaging followers or failing to respond to messages and comments.
