SBa_E0004: Information Sheet
Description
An information sheet is a document that covers all of the key information that a research participant should be aware of before agreeing to take part in the research. Independently of how participants are first approached, they should be provided with an information sheet to take away so that they can read the sheet and consider it under no pressure.
The information sheet should outline:
The project title
An invitation to take part in the research
Purpose of the research
What to expect
Confidentiality and how this will be maintained
Outcomes of the research
Contact details in case there are any questions or concerns
