1SBa_M0002: Archival Research
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
The records have a range of scales, from individual accounts to communities. The descriptions are often highly detailed with multiple viewpoints and times. As records are historical, they may allow times and chronology to be established with events that took place.
Limitations
This research method can be more complex and time-consuming than other methods when identifying, locating and interpreting relevant documents. A researcher must also be prepared to travel to gain access to the information which can be cost and time expensive. Also, some records may not be available for the general public.
The records may be incomplete or bias due to institutional preservation so this needs to interpreted carefully.
The language may be very different depending on the age of the documents. Again, they may be difficult to interpret and understand to draw conclusions.
