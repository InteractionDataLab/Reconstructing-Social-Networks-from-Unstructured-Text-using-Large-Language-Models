Lab Protocols
Protocol 1 - Produce LB broth
Materials and Equipment
LB broth mix, sterile water, weighing scales, weighing boat, conical flask, measuring cylinder.
Time
Prep: 5 minutes
Run: 2 hours
Procedure
Weigh out 2g of LB broth mix in a weighing boat and add into a 250ml conical flask. Measure 100ml sterile water into a measuring cylinder and dispense into the same conical flask. Swirl. Stopper the flask with cotton wool and foil. Label on autoclave tape. Format 'iGEM, Room Number'. Move the flask(s) to the autoclave to be sterilised.
Protocol 2 - Produce LB Agar
Materials and Equipment
LB Agar mix, sterile water, weighing scales, weighing boat, conical flask, measuring cylinder.
Time
Prep: 5 minutes
Run: 2 hours
Procedure
Weigh out 3.5g of LB agar mix in a weighing boat and add into a conical flask
Measure 100ml sterile water into a measuring cylinder and dispense into the same conical flask.
Swirl.
Stopper the flask with cotton wool and foil.
Label on autoclave tape. Format 'iGEM, Room Number'.
Move the flask(s) to the autoclave to be sterilised.
Protocol 3 - Make overnight starter cultures
Materials and Equipment
Stripette, bunsen burner, sterile loop, falcon tubes, LB broth.
Time
Prep: 10 minutes
Run: 16 hours
Procedure
Use a stripette to take 5ml of LB broth from a 250ml conical flask.
Dispense into a falcon tube.
Sterilise a metal loop in a flame.
Take a culture from an agar plate using the sterile loop and put into one of the falcon tubes.
Agitate.
Replicate this using scrapings from a clean agar plate and a fresh tube to use as a positive control.
Put the tubes into the incubator overnight (37c, 150rpm) to grow up the cultures.
Protocol 4 - Generate chemically competent E. coli
Materials and equipment
LB broth, starter culture, P1000, P200, pipette tips, incubator, cuvettes, spectrophotometer, Virkon, falcon tubes, ice, weighing scales, centrifuge, CaCl2, 20% glycerol, stripette, eppendorf tubes and -80°C freezer.
Time
Prep:
Run:
Procedure
1. Grow cells.
Take 1ml starter culture and add to 100ml LB broth.
Incubate at 37°C, 150rpm
Check every hour by testing the optical density at 600nm (OD) using a spectrophotometer to determine whether enough cells are present in the culture; 0.600 OD is ideal, this is the point at which the cells are in the exponential growth phase.
Take 1ml of culture into a cuvette to measure; dispose of this after use in Virkon
2. Remove cells
Pour 30ml aliquots from the flasks into falcon tubes; 3 tubes per flask.
Put tubes on ice for approx 10mins; all equipment used from this point on must be cold e.g. pipette tips.
Weigh the falcon tubes and pair together similar weight tubes for balance in the centrifuge; tubes paired together must weigh within 0.5g of each other.
Spin at 4°C, 4000rpm for 5mins.
After the tubes have all been spun, pour off the supernatant to remove the LB broth, leaving cells in a pellet. Put tubes back on the ice.
3. Make cells competent
Add 1ml of CaCl2 to the cells, use the pipette to pull the liquid and cells up and down to resuspend.
Once resuspended, add another 14ml of CaCl2; 15ml total volume.
Put back on ice for approx. 10mins to allow cells to acclimatise at the temperature with the CaCl2
Re-weigh and pairs tubes again for balance.
Spin again at 4°C, 4000rpm for 5mins.
After tubes have been spun, leave on ice for 5mins. Pour off the supernatant?
4. Aliquot
Add 600μl of 20% glycerol to each falcon tube.
Label eppendorf tubes.
Aliquot 200μl from each falcon tube into eppendorf tubes (3 per falcon).
Freeze at -80°C.
Protocol 5 - Mini-prep
Materials and Equipment
Ice, starter cultures, mini-prep kit, centrifuge, P100 pipette, weighing scale, Virkon
Time
Prep:
Run:
Protocol
1. Extract cells
Match up weights of falcon tubes so they are paired within 0.5g
Spin down starter cultures in a centrifuge; 5mins, 4°C, 4000rpm
Pour off supernatant into Virkon
2. Resuspend cells
Add 250μl of P1 resuspension buffer to each falcon tube using P1000
Resuspend the cells
Use pipette to move suspension into separate, labelled eppendorf tubes
3. Lyse cells
Add 250μl of P2 buffer to each eppendorf tube
This will lyse cells - a blue colour will indicate they have been lysed
Do not leave for more than 5mins
4. Neutralise cells
Add 350μl of N3 neutralisation buffer
Once the reaction is complete, the liquid will turn clear/white
5. Purify DNA
Spin down the cells in a centrifuge; 10 mins, 17000g, 4°C
Pour supernatant into mini-prep columns
Centrifuge columns for 1min, 17000g, 4°C
Discard flow through
Add 500μl of PB buffer to each column
Centrifuge columns for 1min, 17000g, 4°C
Discard flow through
Add 750μl PE buffer to each column
Centrifuge columns for 1min, 17000g, 4°C
Pour off supernatent
Centrifuge columns for 1min, 17000g, 4°C
Discard bottom of the mini-prep
Move column to a new labelled eppendorf
Add 50μl of elution buffer
Centrifuge columns for 1min, 17000g, 4°C
Discard column
Immediately place on ice; store in the B56 sewer sample freezer
