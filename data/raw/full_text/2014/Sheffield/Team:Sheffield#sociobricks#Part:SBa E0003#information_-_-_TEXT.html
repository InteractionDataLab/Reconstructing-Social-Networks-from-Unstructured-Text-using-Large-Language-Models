SBa_E0003: Consent Form
Contents
1SBa_E0003: Consent Form
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
Both the researcher and participant have a clear, mutual understanding of what will happen during the research. Having evidence of this is also something to fall back on in case something goes wrong or accusations are made of force since the participant signs the agreement.
Limitations
As there is the option of withdrawal of consent from participating in the research, you cannot always guarantee reliability that you will be able to gain information from your research. However, mostly, this is quite unlikely.
