SBa_F0002: Symbolic Interactionism
Contents
1SBa_F0002: Symbolic Interactionism
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
A major strength of this theory is that it takes into account free will of individuals, how they behave and the choices they make. It is more detailed and beneficial to individuals as a micro theory as it gives a real insight into small scale interactions which may not be defined by a macro theory. For example, SBa_F0001 may overlook this.
Limitations
Symbolic Interactionism is quite flawed when drawing conclusions as symbols may be interpreted incorrectly. The meanings to the symbols cannot be traced easily and so it relies heavily on other sociological theories.
The theory also fails to develop many sociological ideas such as order and how this comes about.
