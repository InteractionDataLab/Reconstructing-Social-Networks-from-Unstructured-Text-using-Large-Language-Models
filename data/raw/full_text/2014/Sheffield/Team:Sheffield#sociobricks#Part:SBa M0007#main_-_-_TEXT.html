SBa_M0007: Ethnographical Observation
Description
Ethnography is the study of people and cultures from direct observation of a group. Instead of testing a hypothesis as seen in other research methods, there is a strong emphasis on exploring the nature of social phenomenon. A typical ethnography contains a brief history and analysis of the environment or habitat which makes a substantial contribution towards the understand of the social life of humans as it is a credible reality.
Essentially, all observed behaviour is recorded and symbol-meaning relations are described using concepts to avoid casual explanations.
