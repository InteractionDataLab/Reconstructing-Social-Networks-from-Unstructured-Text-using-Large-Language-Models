SBa_F0001: Conflict Theory
Contents
1SBa_F0001: Conflict Theory
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
The conflict theory looks for moral ends to remove this universality of one group taking power. It seeks to justify it on the grounds of ‘freedom for all’
Limitations
There are several limitations of the social conflict theory:
There is a lack of scientific research when dealing with interpersonal conflict so there may not be grounds to uphold the theory.
Incorporation of the theory in different environments is difficult. For example, it is difficult to link family dynamics to class, work and labour.
The theory is very negative. It states that humanitarian acts and civil rights movements were all acts in order to control society better, rather than to promote peace.
