SBa_A1004: Content Analysis
Description
Content analysis looks to analyse text in different forms such as writing, images and recordings. This can be used for many purposes such as testing hypothesis and evaluating research. The core questions which content analysis aims to answer are ‘who, what, where, when and how?’
It can be both a qualitative and quantitative analysis method.
