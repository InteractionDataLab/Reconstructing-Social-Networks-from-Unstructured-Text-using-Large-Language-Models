SBa_M0002: Archival Research
Description
Archival research involved seeking and extracting primary evidence from archival records held in archives or repositories in an institution/organisation; this is different from library research, which would be from secondary sources. It is mainly used for historical research but can be used in many different contexts such as for sociological research. The original sources may be used to ask new questions, provide comparison over time and verify or challenge existing findings, just to name a few.
