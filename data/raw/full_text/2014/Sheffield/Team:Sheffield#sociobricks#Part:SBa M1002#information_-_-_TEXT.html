Strengths
A lecture is a great way to convey new material to a large group of people. Depending on the lecturing style, it can also help facilitate large group discussions and questioning during the lecture.
Limitations
As this is a very passive method, the audience may ‘switch off’; it is critical to keep lectures as short as possible and no longer than 50 minutes as this is the time at which people begin to lose focus.
Bad lecturing skills will fail to convey information across - this is the main limitation of this method. Things to avoid would include:
Overloading presentation slides with text
it is difficult to digest what is seen on the screen at the same time as what is being said
keep slides short and concise
Talking about something different to the slide - this can cause a lot of confusion over what is relevant and what isnt
Not talking loudly and clearly
Using vocabulary suited to your audience
the words used during the lecture are critical in making it effective
tailor the talk; for example, basic language for younger people and technical words for experts in the field
