1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
Focus groups are very useful for exploring ideas and concepts and makes it easier to understand an individual’s internal thinking and how they react to one another. They are also low cost compared to other methods and the sample size can be increased or decreased easily.
Limitations
This method requires a moderator who may be difficult to find as they must have good facilitative skills.
Sometimes participants may feel as though they are being watched which may cause them to alter their viewpoints and opinions. Also, in some groups, there may be dominating participants who could oppress others or again cause someone not to share their viewpoint if it is not the same as theirs.
Data analysis and transcription can time consuming due to their open-ended nature.
