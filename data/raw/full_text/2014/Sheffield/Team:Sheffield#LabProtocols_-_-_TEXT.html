Protocol 1: Make overnight starter cultures
Materials and Equipment

Dispense into a falcon tube.
Sterilise a metal loop in a flame.
Take a culture from an agar plate using the sterile loop and put into one of the falcon tubes.

Time
Prep: 40 minutes
Run: 5 hours
Procedure
Grow cells
Take 1ml starter culture and add to 100ml LB broth.
Incubate at 37°C, 150rpm.
Check every hour by testing the optical density at 600nm (OD) using a spectrophotometer to determine whether enough cells are present in the culture.
0.600 OD is ideal, this is the point at which the cells are in the exponential growth phase.
Take 1ml of culture into a cuvette to measure; dispose of this after use in Virkon.
Remove cells
Pour 30ml aliquots from the flasks into falcon tubes; 3 tubes per flask.
Put tubes on ice for approx 10mins; all equipment used from this point on must be cold e.g. pipette tips.
Weigh the falcon tubes and pair together similar weight tubes for balance in the centrifuge; tubes paired together must weigh within 0.5g of each other.
Spin at 4°C, 4000rpm for 5mins.
After the tubes have all been spun, pour off the supernatant to remove the LB broth, leaving cells in a pellet. Put tubes back on the ice.
Make cells competent
Add 1ml of CaCl2 to the cells, use the pipette to pull the liquid and cells up and down to resuspend.
Once resuspended, add another 14ml of CaCl2; 15ml total volume.
Put back on ice for approx. 10mins to allow cells to acclimatise at the temperature with the CaCl2.
Re-weigh and pairs tubes again for balance.
Spin again at 4°C, 4000rpm for 5mins.
After tubes have been spun, leave on ice for 5mins. Pour off the supernatant?
Aliquot
Add 600μl of 20% glycerol to each falcon tube.
Label eppendorf tubes.
Aliquot 200μl from each falcon tube into eppendorf tubes (3 per falcon).
Freeze at -80°C.
