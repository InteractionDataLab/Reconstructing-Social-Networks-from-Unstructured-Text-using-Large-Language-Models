SBa_M0008: Bibliometrics
Description
Bibliometrics is a quantitative research method in which academic literature is analysed by citation and/or content analysis. The methods are mostly used in the field of library and information science but can also be used to analyse the impact of their work and other researchers work, their field or a particular paper. With citation analysis, citations within papers can be traced and also found in other papers to understand their significance and use. These weighted quantitative measures, such as papers per researched or citations per per paper are useful remove characteristics that may colour perceptions of quality such as place of production or past reputation.
