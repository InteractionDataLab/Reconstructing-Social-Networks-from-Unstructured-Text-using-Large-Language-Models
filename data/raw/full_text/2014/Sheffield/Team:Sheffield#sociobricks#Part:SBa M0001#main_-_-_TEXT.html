SBa_M0001: Oral History
Description
An oral history is a method of collecting historical information about an individual, important events or everyday using planned interviews to gain different perspectives. The person interviewed would have participated in or observed a past event with a clear memory of what happened which could be recorded for future generations. This can then be converted into written work to be preserved in archives and libraries.
The questions asked tend to be open-ended to avoid leading questions.
