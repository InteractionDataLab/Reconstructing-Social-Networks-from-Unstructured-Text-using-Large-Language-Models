SBa_E0004: Information Sheet
Contents
1SBa_E0004: Information Sheet
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
The information sheet is a great tool to use to give the participant a brief description of the project and also get their thoughts and ideas flowing about the topic. It can also help the participant determine whether they would be able to make a significant contribution to your research. Essentially, it helps them feel at ease as you are able to clearly state what, why and how things will happen during the research.
Limitations
There aren’t many limitations to providing an information sheet unless not all aspects as state above are outlined clearly.
