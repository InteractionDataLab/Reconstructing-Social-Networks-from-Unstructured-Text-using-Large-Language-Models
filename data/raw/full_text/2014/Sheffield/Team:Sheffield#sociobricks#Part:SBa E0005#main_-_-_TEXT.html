SBa_E0005: DBS Check
Description
The disclosure and barring service (DBS) check was previously known as the CRB (criminal records bureau) check is a legal requirement in the UK for employers to refer safeguarding concerns. It is illegal for anyone barred by the DBS work or apply to work in a sector from which they are barred; it is also illegal for the employer to employ a barred person knowingly.
In regards to education and schools, a DBS check may be required before any educational outreach and teaching can take place. Ofsted, the official body for inspecting schools, have said:
“As long as the placement provider – for example a school or nursery – can ensure that the students are adequately supervised at all times, it is permissible for them to start their placements pending the completion of the DBS check. However, if the school or nursery cannot provide this level of supervision, they are entitled to ask for the completed DBS check before the placement starts.”  (Source: http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/schools/for-schools/safeguarding-children#students )
Therefore, it is acceptable for outreach to be conducted if it is a one-off activity and the supervision can be guaranteed. If not, and if the outreach is to run over a few weeks, it is required to get a DBS check.
