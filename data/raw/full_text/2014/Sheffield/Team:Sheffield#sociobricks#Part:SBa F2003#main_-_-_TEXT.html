SBa_F2003: Business Plan
Description
A business plan is designed to give an outline of business goals, why and how they are attainable. Alongside this, it will introduce the business and it’s motivations.  It should enable to reader to understand why and how the business is likely to succeed in the market. Business plans should be kept simple and concise. However it should include a comprehensive justification (which may include analysis) that supports the claim that your business will be successful. Specifically, business plans must include 2 points:
Business goals
How the goals will be achieved
A major contributing factor to this business plan will be the market research ( SBa_F2001 ) to justify why and product design ( SBa_F2002 ) in marking up costs.
For outputs of the research when compiling into a business plan, see SBa_O0008 .
