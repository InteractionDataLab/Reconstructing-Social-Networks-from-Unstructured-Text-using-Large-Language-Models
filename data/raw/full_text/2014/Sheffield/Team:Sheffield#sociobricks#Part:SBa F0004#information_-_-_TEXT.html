SBa_F0004: Grounded Theory
Contents
1SBa_F0004: Grounded Theory
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
Grounded theory is a good basis to build new, high quality theories as the methods are more refined due to the detailed, systematic data collection and analysis procedures. Creation of a new theory can help future investigations into the phenomenon.
Limitations
To build a new theory, high volumes of data must be collected which requires experience and patience from the researched. There will also be a lot of noise and chaos in the data that will need to be dealt with in order to continue analysis.
Assumptions will always have to be made before starting the study.
It can be difficult to gauge when enough data has been collected and analysed as a basis to uphold the new theory.
