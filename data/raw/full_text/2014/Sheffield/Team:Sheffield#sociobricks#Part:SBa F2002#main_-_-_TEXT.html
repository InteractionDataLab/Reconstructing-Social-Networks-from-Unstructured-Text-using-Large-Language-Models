SBa_F2002: Product Design
Description
Product design includes all the analysis, technical drawings and descriptions that help define the new product to be sold by a business. It should be an effective portrait of the ideas that have lead to the generation of this new product. Product design synthesis should be done in the following sequence:
Analysis of the problem the product aims to tackle
Introducing the concept, which consists in defining the product based on the analysis
Synthesis of the final product.
Considerations for the Design of your product:
Final price
Competitors
Efficiency
How easy it is to use
Maintenance cost/labour/time
Risks associated with the product in case of failure.
There are many outputs of the product design research carried out; these can be found under SBa_O0007 .
