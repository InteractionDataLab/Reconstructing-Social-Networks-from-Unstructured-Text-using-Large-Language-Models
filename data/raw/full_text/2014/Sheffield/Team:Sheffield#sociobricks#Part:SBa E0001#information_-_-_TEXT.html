SBa_E0001: Risk Assessment

1.1Strengths

1.3Further information
Strengths
A risk assessment allows you to think about the potential risks that may affect your project or the people involved. This means mitigating circumstances can be identified early in order to prevent and limit their impact.
Limitations
Some of the weaknesses identified at the start may be forgotten or ignored during the remainder of the project; it is important to keep in mind that it is not possible to completely limit risks and there may be unforeseeable risks as the project is running.
