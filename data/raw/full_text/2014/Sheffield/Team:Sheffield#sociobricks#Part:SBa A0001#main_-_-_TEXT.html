SBa_A0001: Trend Modelling
Description
Trend modelling is a statistical method of data interpretation. By understanding the trends in the data drawn from research, a model can be used to better characterize the behaviour of the observed data and can be used to help predict some of the output points of a different data set  (assuming the same model will apply).
