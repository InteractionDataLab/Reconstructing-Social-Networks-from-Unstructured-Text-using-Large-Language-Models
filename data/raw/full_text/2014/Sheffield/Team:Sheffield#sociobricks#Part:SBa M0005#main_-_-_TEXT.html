SBa_M0005: Questionnaire
Description
A questionnaire has a series of questions and prompts to gather information relating to a topic from the respondents. They can be used for statistical or qualitative analysis of responses.
Essentially, it is a type of survey with standardised answers. The answers for closed-ended questions should be exhaustive and mutually exclusive. There are four types of answers that could be used:
Dichotomous - two options; one or the other
Nominal-polytomous - more than two options, unordered
Ordinal-polytomous - more than two options, ordered
Continous - continous scale
The questions should also flow logically from one to the other i.e. from the least sensitive and general to the most sensitive and specific.
