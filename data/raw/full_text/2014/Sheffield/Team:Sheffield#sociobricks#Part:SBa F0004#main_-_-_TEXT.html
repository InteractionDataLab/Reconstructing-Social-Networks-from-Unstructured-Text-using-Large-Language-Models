SBa_F0004: Grounded Theory
Description
Grounded theory is a qualitative social science research method originally developed in the 1960s. Like most other research methods, the aim of grounded theory is to develop a theory about the phenomena being studied, but it differs in its approach, which is empirically grounded.
A typical application of grounded theory is highly iterative. The research begins by asking generative questions which are useful as a guide but are open to change. As more data is gathered, core theoretical concepts are identified and linkages are developed between these concepts and the data. This stage is often very open and can take time to progress.
After many iterations and theoretical revisions, a core concept is identified and the details are described comprehensively. By following this process it is possible to end up with an extremely well considered report explaining the phenomena of interest and grounded in observational data.
