1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
A business plan will help to understand whether or not the business is feasible in terms of costs and profits.
Once the plan is complete, it can be compared to existing products or businesses to understand and justify why this is a better option.
Limitations
It can be a time consuming task to generate a business plan.
Not all of the important costs and factors may have been considered; if this is wrong, the entire business initiative could fail.
