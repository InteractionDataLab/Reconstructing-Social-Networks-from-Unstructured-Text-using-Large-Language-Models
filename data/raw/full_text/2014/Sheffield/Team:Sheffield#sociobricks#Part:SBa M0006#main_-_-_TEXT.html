SBa_M0006: Focus Group
Description
A focus group is a qualitative method used to find perceptions, opinions and attitudes toward something in an interactive group setting where everyone is free to discuss with one another.
In a social science setting, the interviewer is able to study people in a natural conversation pattern which may not be seen in an individual interview. It is a useful method used to learn about patterns and interactions in groups.
