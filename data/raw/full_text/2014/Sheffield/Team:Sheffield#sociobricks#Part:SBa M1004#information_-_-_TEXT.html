SBa_M1004: Newsletter
Contents
1SBa_M1004: Newsletter
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
Strengths
Regular newsletters are a good way of keeping sponsors, supporters and anyone else involved in your project updated on your progress. They can also be tailored to attract new sponsors to support your project.
Leaflets, although small, allow you to convey key bits of information across to people to raise awareness.
A electronic version may be a better option as most people have access to and use their emails regularly. You can also track when someone has opened an electronic newsletter using web bugs.
Limitations
Newsletters can be text heavy which people may then choose to ignore because they simply have no time and can’t pick out the key pieces of information.
Printing can be expensive if there are high quality images and good paper is used.
