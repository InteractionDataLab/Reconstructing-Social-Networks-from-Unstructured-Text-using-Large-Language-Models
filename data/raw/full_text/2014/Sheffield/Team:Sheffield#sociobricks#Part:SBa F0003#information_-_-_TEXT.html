SBa_F0003: Actor-Network Theory
Contents
1SBa_F0003: Actor-Network Theory
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
1.3Further information
Strengths
ANT doesn’t fit the true definition of a theory as it does not understand why, but more how things exist. Because of this it is an empirical method as such to gain insight into general sociological inquiry.
Limitations
The incorporation of nonhumans with the capacity to act within networks is a very controversial aspect of the theory. All actors are treated as equal, even if this may not be the case and so social class or power imbalance is not accounted for.
