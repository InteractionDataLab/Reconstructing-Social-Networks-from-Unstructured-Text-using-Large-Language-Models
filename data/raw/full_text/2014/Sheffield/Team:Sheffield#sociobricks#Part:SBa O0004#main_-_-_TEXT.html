SBa_O0004: Report
Description
Social research generates data, which may be analysed using social sciences methods. The generation of a report allows the data obtained to be compared and discussed and conclusions of the research may be drawn. The main purpose of a report is to relay information in a presentable form.  A report may be a decisive element of evidence for actions or appropriate measures to be taken (depending on the type of social research that is being conducted).
Further on, social research reports may involve policy evaluation and cost-benefit analyses.
