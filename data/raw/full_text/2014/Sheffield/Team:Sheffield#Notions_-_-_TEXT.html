Notions of Responsbility
As another component of our policy and practices work, we set out to identify where the responsibility for the maintenance of the damaged drains lies. Should we, as young synthetic biologists, be addressing this? Or should this be the industries responsibility? Or even the consumers who may be pouring the fats, oils and greases down the drain?
In order to answer this question, we set out to conduct semi-structured interviews (SBa_M0004) with representatives from the water industry, local restaurants, council members and homeowners. We then used trend modelling (SBa_A0001) to identify key areas of crossover and difference between the opinions of those interviewed. Furthermore, we compared the information gained from the interview with the actual position of law recognised in this area.
As well as understanding if synthetic biology should be the solution to this problem in particular, talking to industry experts greatly helped to shape our project further by understand where in the pipeline (no pun intended!) The Fatberglar would be best implemented.
The full report can be found below; the specific questions asked, as well as the necessary ethics and consent documentation we gained is also presented here.
