At the start of our project, we undertook a week of boot camp – yes, it was as intense as it sounds! With all team members coming from a range of backgrounds with different abilities, we thought that this would be a good idea to allow everyone to be on the same page with the same basic level of understanding in each component of the project. As well as this, it was a great icebreaker that helped our team of students, advisors and supervisors to get to know each other better! Following on from this, we officially began our work over the summer.
