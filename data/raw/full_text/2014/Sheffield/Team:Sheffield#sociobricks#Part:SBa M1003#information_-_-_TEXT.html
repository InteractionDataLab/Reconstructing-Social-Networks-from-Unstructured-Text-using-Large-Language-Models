SBa_M1003: Seminar
Contents
1SBa_M1003: Seminar
1.1Strengths
1.2Limitations
Strengths
Seminars are a good way of getting ideas flowing between the groups of people taking part in the activity as they are free to openly discuss what they think.
If the activity is to produce, for example, a diagram or drawing relating to information given prior to the activity such as a lecture, it is a good measure of seeing how much was actually understood and what may need to be discussed again.
It is an active method to which some participants may respond better than to a passive lecture.
Limitations
Sometimes participants may feel as though they are being watched which may cause them to alter their viewpoints and opinions. Also, in some groups, there may be dominating participants who could oppress others or again cause someone not to share their viewpoint if it is not the same as theirs.
