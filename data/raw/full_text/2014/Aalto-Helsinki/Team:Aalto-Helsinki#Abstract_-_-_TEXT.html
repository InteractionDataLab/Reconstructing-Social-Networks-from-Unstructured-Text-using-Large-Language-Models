Abstract
Our goal is to develop a system which allows us to control bacterial gene expression with a remote controller. Our device could be used in bioreactors, making prototyping and multi-phase production chains faster, easier and more profitable. We’re making a proof-of-concept controller prototype for research teams, but it can be further scaled up for industrial purposes, such as medical chemical industry.
