Partners are an essential part of our project - with your support we do better and reach our most ambitious goals.
Our supporters will get visibility on our website, in our blog, in the videos and on team t-shirts, as well as in different events, like the Giant Jamboree in Boston.
We offer different bundles for our sponsors, from which you can choose the best one for you. We can always tune the contents of the bundles and have them tailor-made for you.
All supporters will be mentioned on the partners page on our website regardless of the form of support.
