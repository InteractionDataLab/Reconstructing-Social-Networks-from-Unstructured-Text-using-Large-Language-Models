      In March, we had 9 students who were excited about a new field of science that was hardly known in Finland. No experience, some studies, but a lot of excitement.
    </P><P>
      In October, we had developed a genetically engineered machine from scratch, made a mathematical model and a simulation based on it, ran our own research lab for five months, designed web applications to make research easier, built a pitch explaining synthetic biology to the general public, figured out a new way to do business and built a massive wiki documenting all of this. How did that happen? Check it out here.
    </P><P>
      Our priorities during the summer were:
      <OL><LI>Have Fun</LI><LI>Learn New Things</LI><LI>Work Hard</LI><LI>Make Something New</LI></OL></P><P>
      We worked at least 8 hours a day from the middle of May until the end of August in Aalto University's science campus in Otaniemi. There was a huge learning hub/living room in the building adjacent to our lab, so we made it our HQ during the summer. Then we kept on working as much as possible in the autumn while continuing our studies. Some managed to pull off the same hours as before while still keeping up with their studies!

                All of our team members who worked in the lab have had safety training as a part of their studies. The training covered the following topics:
            </P><UL><LI>Personal protective wear: safety goggles, lab coats and gloves
              </LI><LI>General safety: acting in case of an accident, where to find emergency showers and fire extinguishers, understanding safety labels
              </LI><LI>Chemical safety: working with different chemicals and how to dispose of them
              </LI><LI>GMO safety: putting all waste that has been in contact with bacteria (living or dead) to bacterial waste, aseptic working methods
              </LI></UL><P>
              In our iGEM work we have only worked with non-toxic <I>E. coli</I> (K12 derivatives) and all the protein coding sequences that we have used in our project are non-hazardous. We did not create new protein coding sequences but instead we used sequences that are already available as Biobricks.
            </P><H3>Our Laboratory</H3><P>
              We got to work in the Bioprocess Technology lab of Aalto University. We had our own lab bench and we got to use all the instruments and equipment in the department. We also did some measurements in the labs of the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.

              We also needed a proper office space where we could work during the summer since not everyone was going to do lab work and our lab bench wasn’t that spacious either.
            </P><P>
              We managed to find the &quot;Learning Hub Living Room&quot; (Vuori Hub) in the building of Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Since it was summer, there weren't many people around to use the space and we made it our home. It was a comfortable place to work in!

      Being the first team in Finland, we wanted to make sure that we documented everything we did as rigorously as possible.
    </P><P>
      We have our lab notebook in PDF files. From these you will be able to find everything that was done in the lab on a specific date.

      We borrowed a convention from the software development framework, Scrum. So, every day all the team members answered these three questions:
    </P><OL><LI>What did you do yesterday?</LI><LI>What will you do today?</LI><LI>What might stop you from doing what you want to do?</LI></OL><P>
      Each of us wrote the answers down on our online team chat tool (Flowdock). According to the answers, we then assembled a detailed description of every single working day during our official work months (from May 20th to the end of August). So if you really really want to read exactly what we did, here's 30 pages of text for you to check out:

The calculator calculates how many microliters of miniprepped plasmid is needed to be digested in order to pipet 4 ul of each digestion mix to the ligation mix. Insert-plasmid ratio as well as vector mass fields could be changed if needed. Taking these two variables into account, the appropriate molar amount and then the mass amount of inserts are calculated using the information of their lengths. This tiny little excel tool really saved time in the lab during the summer.</P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="month" id="May"><DIV class="tldate">May 2014</DIV></LI><LI class="entry timeline-inverted"><DIV class="timeline-panel"><DIV class="tl-heading"><H4>Precipitation of the Cell Membranes</H4><P><SMALL class="text-muted">30.5.2014</SMALL></P></DIV><DIV class="tl-body"><P>This process would be repeated about 50 times during the summer, but this was the first..</P></DIV></DIV></LI><LI class="entry"><DIV class="timeline-panel"><DIV class="tl-heading"><H4>The First Version of BioBrick Seeker</H4><P><SMALL class="text-muted">30.5.2014</SMALL></P></DIV><DIV class="tl-body"><P>It started from the mild inconvenience of searching for BioBricks from four different excel sheets in the lab.
