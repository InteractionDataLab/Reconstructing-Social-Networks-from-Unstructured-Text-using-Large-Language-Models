Our Advisers
Sun Jiayi
Ashok Prasad, Ph.D.
Christie Peebles, Ph.D.
Department: Chemical/Biological Engineering
Research Interests: Sun is a graduate student at CSU working in Dr. Peebles lab. Specifically, she works with periwinkles. She advises all of the iGEM team members in day-to-day activities.
Department: Chemical/Biological Engineering
Research Interests: Dr. Prasad's research is driven by concrete biological and bio-engineering questions as well as the larger questions posed by systems biology and quantitative biology. He investigates questions such as 'What does it mean to say that life is an emergent property of complex biological networks? Are there non-trivial universal principles that "living matter" obeys?' The main method his lab uses to answer these questions is creation and development of predictive biological models.
Department: Chemical/Biological Engineering
Research Interests: Dr. Peebles' research is focused in the areas of metabolic engineering, secondary metabolism, regulatory networks, and systems biology in plants, bacteria and yeast for the production of bio-based chemicals and fuels.  More specifically, these areas can be divided into 2 main applications.  One application is the use of plant metabolic engineering to produce important pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals.  The second is the engineering of photoautotrophs for the production of bio-based chemicals and fuels.
