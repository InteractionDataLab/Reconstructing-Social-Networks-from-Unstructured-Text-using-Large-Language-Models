Design Primers
Create the gene sequence using KEGG and ApE
Design primers using IDT's Oligo Analyzer
Considerations:
Primers should be at least 40 base pairs (bp) long and contain approximately 20 bp from each joining fragment
For each primer pair (that is, primers amplifying the same gene), the melting temperature (Tm) of the entire primer should be close as well as the 2nd half Tm
The highest hairpin Tm should be less than 50 °C
Avoid repeats of 4 or more
At the 3' end, you should end with a G or C, avoid a T or mismatches, and avoid runs of 3 or more G/Cs in the last 5 bps at the 3' end
G/C content should be 40-60%
PCR Gibson Fragments
For genes in plasmids:
Start overnight cultures from glycerol stocks
Miniprep overnight cultures
PCR using mini prepped plasmid DNA

Save 5 μL PCR product for gel electrophoresis
Digest with DpnI to remove methylated DNA as described in Manual
For genes not in plasmids:
Follow genomic DNA PCR thermal cycler protocol (see Tables 1-1 and 1-2)
Check and Clean Up PCR Products
Check size of each PCR product by gel electrophoresis
If any PCR reaction was unsuccessful, repeat the PCR of the Gibson Fragments
Clean up PCR products of correct size with the PCR clean-up kit and determine DNA concentrations
Prepare Gibson Reaction
Use Equation in manual to calculate the fragment concentration
For 2 - 3 fragments, the total DNA should be 0.05 - 0.2 pmols
For 4 - 6 fragments, the total DNA should be 0.2 - 1.0 pmols
Make Gibson reaction mixture according to manual
Pipette up and down to mix
Run thermalcycler program as described in manual
Transformation
Note: It is important to transform as soon as possible
30 minutes before the end of the Gibson reaction, thaw competent cells on ice and set water bath to 42 DEGC
Add 2.5 uL Gibson product to cells
Heat shock cells for 30 seconds at 42 C without shaking
Place on ice for 2 minutes
Aseptically (in hood) add 250 uL appropriate media to the tube and cap tightly
Place tubes horizontally in incubator; incubate at 37 C and 225 rpm for 1 hour
In the hood, spread 100 uL on plate
Incubate overnight at 37 C; store remaining culture at 4 C
Confirm Correct Construction of Plasmid (Colony PCR)
Choose primers that flank multiple fragments of the assembled DNA
Set up PCR reaction (follow reaction mixture from above for 50 uL)
To add template DNA:
Using a sterile toothpick or pipette tip, touch colony, rotate 180 degrees, and touch colony again
Streak on LB plate with appropriate antibiotics so that you can use colony for future steps
Swirl toothpick/pipette tip in the PCR tube to resuspend the cells
Pipette up and down to mix
Run PCR thermalcycler program as described in manual.
Run gel electrophoresis to verify PCR product and confirm plasmid by sequencing if desired
