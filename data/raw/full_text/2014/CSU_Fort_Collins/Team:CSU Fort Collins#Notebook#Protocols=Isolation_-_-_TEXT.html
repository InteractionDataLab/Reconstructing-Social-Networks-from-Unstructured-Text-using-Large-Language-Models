PCR Product Purification
Make a 1 cm x 1 cm path of yeast cells in YPD (or appropriate selective media) plates, grow for 1 - 2 days
Cut a microcentrifuge tube at the 100 μL line, but leave a small piece uncut so that you can bend the bottom 90 degrees to make a scoop. Cut a second tube completely and make a funnel. Use the scoop and funnel to add about 100 μL of glass beads to one empty centrifuge tube for each DNA prep
Add 200 μL of DNA prep buffer to each tube as described in Manual
Use a new toothpick to scrape the yeast cells from plates (1 cm x 1 cm patch) and transfer the cells to tubes making a cell/beads/buffer suspension
Add 200 μL of saturated Phenol:Chloroform 1:1 mixture.Vortex at maximum speed for 3 minutes
Let settle for 1 minute, open the tubes carefully and add 200 μL of water or TE
Close again and centrifuge at top speed for 5 minutes
While centrifuging add 10 μL of 4 M ammonium acetate and 1 ml of 100% ethanol to a clean tube
Transfer 300 μL of supernatant from the tubes with ethanol, leave some supernatant behind to avoid collectin the precipitate in the mid layer
Vortex samples briefly to mix. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes
Wash the DNA/RNA pellet in 70% ethanol, filling the tube halfway
Discard the 70% ethanol, centrifuge briefly to consolidate the 70% ethanol droplets
Remove the remaining 70% ethanol with a pipette tip or vacuum source
Ressuspend the DNA/RNA pellet in 100 μL of 1X TE
Use 1 - 2 μL of this prep as template for PCR. No RNAse treatment is require for most PCR application
Thank you to Guy Stewart for this protocol.
