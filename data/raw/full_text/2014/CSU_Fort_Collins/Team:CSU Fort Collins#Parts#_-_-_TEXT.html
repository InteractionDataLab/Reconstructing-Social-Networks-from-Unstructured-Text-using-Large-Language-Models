KillerRed + Tryptophan Repressor
BioBrick part BBa_K1495000 is a composite part which consists of the KillerRed protein and a Tryptophan promoter taken from our iGEM Distribution Kit.
Description: This part contains the gene called KillerRed. It has been codon optimized for use in E. coli. This functions as a safety piece that can be used for all projects. The KillerRed gene causes the cells to produce reactive oxygen species within the cell when exposed to white light. A tryptophan repressor has been included so that when E. coli transformed with this BioBrick is being used, tryptophan can keep the KillerRed gene from being expressed. Tryptophan is a less common amino acid, thus if the E. coli were to escape it's experimental environment, the organism would die.
