PCR Product Purification
Adjust total volume of all PCR tubes to 100 μL
Add 500 μL Binding Buffer to each tube
Mix well
Insert one High Pure filter tube into one collection tube
Transfer solution from 1 into the filter
Centrifuge 60 seconds at maximum speed
Disconnect filter tube and discard flow-through
Reconnect tubes
Add 500 μL wash buffer to upper reservoir
Centrifuge 60 seconds at maximum speed
Discard the flow-through
Recombine tubes
Add 200 μL wash buffer
Centrifuge for 60 seconds at maximum speed
Discard flow-through and collection tube
Reconnect filter tube to a clean 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
Add 100 μL elution buffer
Centrifuge for 1 minute at maximum speed
The purified PCR product is now in the microcentrifuge tube
Store at 4 °C for short term or at -20 °C for later use
Thank you to Roche (High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit) for this protocol.
