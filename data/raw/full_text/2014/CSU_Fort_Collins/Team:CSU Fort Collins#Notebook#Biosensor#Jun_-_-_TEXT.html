Scientists vs. the PCR Machine
JUNE
Monday, June 2 - Friday, June 6
Had a group meeting to discuss project ideas and paths forward. Received and organized lab supplies. Began literature search for biosensor genes that perform similarly to our goal.
Monday, June 9 - Friday, June 13
Drafted primers to be created by PMF in order to construct promotors based upon Zhang et al.  Diagrammed our plasmid. Researched the Beta-Oxidation pathway.
Monday, June 16 - Friday, June 20
Received primers from PMF and made working concentrations for our experiment. Ran "Promoter Assembly" for all four primers and ran a PCR for PLR.
Monday, June 23 - Friday, June 27
Ran a gel to test the success of the PCR for PLR, and it appeared successful. PAR and PFL were assembled and run through their PCR protocols. Created PCR backups due to uncertainty of ligation prep.  Worked on app development.
