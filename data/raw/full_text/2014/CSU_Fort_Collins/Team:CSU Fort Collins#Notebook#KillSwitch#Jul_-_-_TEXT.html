TRP/KillerRed Assembly
September
Troubleshooting and Biobrick Success
JULY
Tuesday, July 1 - Monday, July 7
Contacted Dr. Peebles about possible lead.  When E. Coli containing the light sensitive gene visA is exposed to intense white light it overproduces protoporphyrin which then inhibits the correct assembly of the cell membrane.  This overproduction causes a buildup of oxygen in the cell causing the cell to rupture. There is an iGEM Bio-Brick attached to this gene (also called the HemH gene) here .
Tuesday, July 8
We looked through registry of standard biological parts from iGEM and we found four possible promoters. We assessed these based on sample availability, uses, experience logs as well as their tendency for leakage.
Wednesday, July 9
Upon recommendation of Dr. Peebles, decided to pursue creation of a KillerRed protein Bio-Brick. The tryptophan (TRP) promoter maybe a good option to control KillerRed. In the presence of tryptophan, a repressor binds to the promoter and inhibits gene expression. When tryptophan is absent, the repressor cannot bind to the promoter and this allows gene expression.
Tuesday, July 15
Miniprep on Trp and GFP. Measured concentrations via nanodrop.
Thursday, July 17
Completed an Enzyme Digestion on Trp and GFP.
Friday, July 18
Ligated Trp + GFP via the Cloning a Gene into a Plasmid protocol. Incubated over the weekend.
Tuesday, July 22
Transformation of Trp + GFP into Puc 19 and plating onto chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance.
Wednesday, July 23
Conformation of construction and colony PCR on successful plates.
Thursday, July 24
Ran successful gels on colonies.
Tuesday, July 29
Prepared overnight culture with LB medium, CM and colonies 11 and 13.
AUGUST
Friday, August 1
Enzyme digestion of puc57-KillerRed linearized plasmid backbone using EcoR1 and Pst1 and PSB1C3 using Xba1 and Spe1
Thursday, August 7
Ligated KillerRed into PSB1C3
Tuesday, August 12
Transformed previous ligation assuming KillerRed would not function without a promoter. Did not successfully yield colonies.
Monday, August 25
Ligated two samples of KillerRed with Puc57.  We decided to test whether the KillerRed ligated into the backbone it came with would be transformable.
Tuesday, August 26
Transformation of linearized plasmid backbone and puc57 KillerRed. Did not yield colonies.
