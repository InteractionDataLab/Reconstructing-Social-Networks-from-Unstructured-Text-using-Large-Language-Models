Locate Genetic Sequence of Interest
Check: do you need to add a restriction enzyme site to the primers to aide in contruction?
Other considerations:
Primer length should be between 18-30 base pairs (bp)
Avoid repeats of 4 or more
The melting temperature (Tm) of the two primers which amplify one gene should be close together and between 52 °C and 65 °C
At the 3' end, you should end with a G or C, avoid a T or mismatches, and avoid runs of 3 or more G/Cs in the last 5 bps at the 3' end
G/C content should be 40-50%
PCR Amplification of Gene
Isolate DNA to be amplified
If DNA is located on a plasmid in E. coli, use a plasmid miniprep kit to isolate plasmid DNA (follow kit instructions) from an overnight culture of backteria
If DNA is located in the genome of some organism, do the appropriate genomic DNA extraction
PCR amplification
Once you receive primers:
Spin vials for 5 minutes at maximum speed in the microcentrifuge
Make a 100 μM stock solution using molecular grade (nuclease-free) water
Vortex for at least 1 minute
Dilute stock solution 1:10 fold for a working solution of 10 μM
Follow PCR reaction mix as described in Table 2-1

Note: Protocol will change for different enzymes
Use New England Biolabs' (NEB) Q5 2X Master Mix, perform at least 2 reactions so that you have plenty to work with in downstream applications

Run electrophoresis gel to check PCR product
Use PCR clean-up kit to clean up PCR samples if successful
Store PCR product at 4 °C or -20 °C until further use
If PCR unsuccessful, refer to manual for further troubleshooting suggestions
Isolate the target plasmid
Identify if your plasmid is high-copy or low-copy
For a high-copy plasmid, the miniprep from one 2 mL overnight culture should be sufficient
For a low-copy plasmid, minipreps from 2 to 4 mL overnight cultures should work
Store plasmid at -20 °C until further use
Restriction Enzyme District
If cutting with two enzymes identify if there is a buffer that will give good activity for both enzymes
If yes: proceed using that buffer
If no: first cut with one enzyme then purify with PCR clean-up kit; then cut with 2nd enzyme
Refer to NEB Website for help in setting up an enzyme digest
Cut both PCR product and backbone (plasmid) using Table 2-3 as a rough guide.

Ligation
Determine concentration of DNA of the insert and the plasmid (nanodrop or run a gel for a relative concentration)
In the ligation mix, make sure there is a total DNA concentration of 1 - 10 ng/μL
Usually use a ratio of 2:1 to 6:1 of insert to backbone (plasmid)
Add components as in Table 2-5

Incubate at room temperature for at least 1 hour
Heat inactivate at 65 °C for 10 minutes and place on ice to cool
Store at 4 °C
Transformation
Thaw competent cells on ice. Leave in microcentrifuge tube. Set water bath to 43 °C and allow LB + antibiotics plates to come to room temperature
Add 1 - 5 μL of ligation to cells
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes
Heat shock cells for 30 seconds at 42 °C without shaking
Place on ice for 2 minutes
In hood, add 250 μL of SOC media to the tube and cap tightly
Spread 100 μL of a 1:10 dilution of the cells on an LB + antibiotics plate
Incubate overnight at 37 °C
Store remaining culture at 4 °C. If nothing grows or a few cells grow, you can plate the remaining the next day
Confirm Correct Construction of Plasmid
Prepare an appropriate amount of 15 mL cell culture tubes with 2 mL LB + antibiotic
Streak and prepare for incubation
Remove an LB + antibiotic plate from 4 °C
Label 1 to X # of colonies
From the overnight transformation plate, touch a sterile toothpick to a single colony, streak on the LB plate of the appropriate number, and place toothpick in culture tube. Repeat with other colonies
Incubate at 37 °C and 225 rpm overnight
Next Day:
Isolate the plasmid by using the miniprep kit on the overnight cultures
If you have a large number of plasmids, check the uncut plasmids on a 0.7% agarose gel without the gene to serve as a control
Check the plasmid by digesting with the appropriate restriction enzyme following the mixture given by Table 2-6
