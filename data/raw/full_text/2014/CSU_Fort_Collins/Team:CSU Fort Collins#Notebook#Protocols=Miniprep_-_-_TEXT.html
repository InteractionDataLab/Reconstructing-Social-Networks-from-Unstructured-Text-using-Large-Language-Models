Before starting:
Add RNase A to Resuspension Buffer (R3) according to the instructions on the label; mix well
Mark on the label that RNase A is added. Store Buffer R3 with RNase A at 4 °C
Warm Lysis Buffer (L7) briefly at 37 °C to redissolve any particulate matter
Add 100% ethanol to Wash Buffer (W9) and Wash Buffer (W10) according to the instructions on each label; mix well
Store wash buffers with ethanol at room temperature
Harvest
Sediment the cells by centrifuging 1 - 5 mL of the overnight LB culture (use 1-2 x 109 E.coli cells for each sample)
Remove all medium
Resuspend
Add 250 μL Resuspension Buffer (R3) with RNase A to the cell pellet
Resuspend pellet until it is homogeneous
Lyse
Note: This step is time sensitive.
Add 250 μL Lysis Buffer (L7)
Mix gently by inverting the capped tube five times (Do NOT vortex)
Incubate the tube at room temperature for 5 minutes
Precipitate
Add 350 μL Precipitation Buffer (N4)
Mix immediately by inverting the tube, or for large pellets, vigorously shaking the tube, until the mixture is homogeneous (Do NOT vortex)
Centrifuge the lysate at >12,000 X g for 10 minutes
Bind
Load the supernatant from step 4 onto a spin column in a 2-mL wash tube
Centrifuge the column at 12,000 X g for 1 minute
Discard the flow-through and place the column back in the wash tube
Wash and Ethanol Removal
Add 700 μL Wash Buffer (W9) with ethanol to the column
Centrifuge the column at 12,000 X g for 1 minute
Discard the flow-through and place the column back into the wash tube
Centrifuge the column at 12,000 X g for 1 minute
Discard the was htube with the flow-through
Elute
Place the spin column in a clean 1.5-mL recovery tube
Add 75 μL of preheated TE Buffer (TE) to the center of the column
Incubate the column for 1 minute at room temperature
Recover
Centrifuge the column at 12,000 X g for 2 minutes
The recovery tube now contains the purified plasmid DNA
Discard the column
Store plasmid DNA at 4 °C (short-term) or store the DNA in aliquots at -20 °C (long-term)
Thank you to Life Technologies for this protocol.
