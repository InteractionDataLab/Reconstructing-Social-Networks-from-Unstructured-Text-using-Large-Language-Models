pMBI and pMevT Assembly
JUNE
Monday, June 2 - Friday, June 6
Researched potential products and decided on the addition of the mevalonate pathway in order to direct E. coli to terpenoid production.
Monday, June 9 - Monday, June 16
Researched the mevalonate pathway in E. coli and sequenced the genes to be inserted into puc19. Designed primers as specified in the Gibson Assembly Protocol for transformation of the mevalonate pathway from yeast into E. coli.
Thursday, June 19
Ran a gel electrophoresis to try and confirm presence of DNA in obtained yeast samples. No results.
Tuesday, June 24
Mixed and autoclaved two 500 mL bottles of LB Broth with Agar and ampicillin. Poured two sleeves of plates to use for culturing.
Wednesday, June 25
Took a small sample of E. coli with puc19 from a previous colony and suspended in LB Broth. Shook at 225 rpm in incubator at 37° C overnight to culture.
Thursday, June 26
Completed a miniprep of E. coli with puc19 from the overnight culture. Followed plasmid miniprep protocol as given in the Informatics (Life Technologies) kit.
Friday, June 27
Completed PCR with the 5 pieces according to the mixture of New England Biotechnologies' Q5 2X Master Mix protocol. Ran a gel electrophoresis to confirm success of PCR.  Amplification of PMK unsuccessful. Amplification of all other portions of the plasmid successful.
Monday, June 30
Modified the PCR thermalcycler program (but used the same 50 μL mixture) and ran a gel to check results. All attempts unsuccessful - suspected due to lack of presence of SYBR green in initial mixture.
