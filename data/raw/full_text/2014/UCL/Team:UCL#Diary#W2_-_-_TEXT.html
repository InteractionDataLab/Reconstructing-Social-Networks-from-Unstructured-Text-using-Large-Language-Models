Week 2
Monday 28/07
Lab meeting
in lab this week: Bez (lead), Edo, Sanjay, Dave, (YK & Sohaila supervising) NO 4 headed monster!
monday restriction double digest to be done for: 5 lisbon plasmids (cut EcoRI+XbaI/uncut), 8 biobricks (cut EcoRI+PstI/uncut), following NEB restriction double digest protocol. LacI and RBS digest necessary for ligation. LacI digested with EcoRI SpeI, RBS with XbaI and Pstl. NEB restriction digest protocol for biobrick assembly. //YK add hyperlinks//
tuesday: run gel, visualization for all 28 lanes of digest, 2 lanes of PCR from last week (friday/wednesday?) //YK// before darren's meeting (11am).
tbd when: sohaila and YK go through the SOP for the assays with adam and ning. hopefully start the assembly of LacI + RBS ( + AzoR + Terminator) #3A
@YK need to email brian! what we need for lab space when we move
Edo
Cried when I saw that my free trial of snapgene expired. Back to pen and paper to do the calculations. Sent an email for sponsorship, finger crossed. Went to lab and prepared the digestion for gel visualisation and ligation of biobricks. Lunch with some good ideas for geeky gimmick, stay updated. Went to microfluidics lab and figured out how to fabricate some cool prototypes of devices.

Prepared restriction digests in the lab, pipetted so much I can barely type anymore. Watched Edo microwave his lunch. Our common room needs pillows so I can nap right now. Got some Bioprocess work done, and worked on the wiki.

Lab plan for the day: Got kicked out of lab in ACBE because the needed to move stuff around. Did the ligation in the MMP anyway. Stuck it to the man. Migrated to Tanel's lab for the transformations. Ligation and transformation of the digested plasmids from yesterday. Calculated ligation ratios. 2 ligations with the RFP as a control transformation on LB agar.  Supposed to meet my cousin for lunch, starving. But I'm so committed to getting these effing transformations done! They better work. Have half an hour to kill while waiting for cells to incubate on ice.

Morning discussion about what we'll be doing this week at the lab meeting; primarily restriction digests to check what we have, so we're ready to ligate and assemble a BioBrick soon. With Lewis B, Soheila, Bez, Edo, Pamela, Dave, Sanjay, and Joy.
In lab with Bez, Edo, Sanjay, and Dave. Prepared yet another fun restriction double digest for the 5 Lisbon plasmids, and 8 distribution BioBricks. Also digested the LacI //link// and RBS //link// in preparation for assembling/ligating our first BioBrick Device! (See Lab Notebook: 28/07/14. //link//)
Had lunch in the quad with Bez and Edo, discussing a super-secret awesome HP idea that will help us win iGEM!
Writing my iGEM diary whilst relaxing on the quad pillars/steps under the hot hot sun. Probably time to move on elsewhere and do something more productive! Impromptu frisbee in the quad begins.
Running round getting printed copies of LiP design, cloning strategy, and lab freezer docs.
Big lab meeting with most of the team to discuss points for tomorrow's general meeting.
Finish the day with food and social at Huntley Bar!
Note to self:
Email Brian our lab requirements.
Make RHnav scrolling.

I have been writing some more on why I am using the case study and ethnography method to examine the team's discourse. Kevkey 09:52, 29 July 2014 (CDT)

Passed by lab then went to new HQ. There I set up the snapgene licenses for the whole team and now all of us can use it. (+ it counts as a ~800 quid sponsorship?). I helped bez a bit with the sponsorhips. Panicked about the synthesised lignin peroxidase sequence, it's not the best version we could get but hopefully it's gonna work. Should we synthesise another one with all the parts? (Promoter, RBS, CDS, Terminator and Histag)
Got ready for darren's meeting. went better than we expected.
Went to print a t-shirt prototype (I mainly wanted one for myself, the final one will be much different)

Writing something here so Edo stops pestering me. Went to the lab this morning, prepared the gel electrophoresis and worked on some Bioprocessing content, had a team meeting with Darren today.

Dear Diary, still in the Science Library working on the same thing as the day before and the day before that. In the meantime, I am preparing myself to go to Brussels tomorrow and work on this from home as much as I can. In that way I can start putting a few things up on the wiki and show that I'm actually doing something :) . I mean, I'm not even sure that the team knows what I'm doing and how this can significantly contribute to the wiki. And yet, I am fine with that. This is probably normal as the social scientist can only do but hover and linger around the actual scientific practitioners working on the product. Time is ticking and everybody is focused on building the magnificent Goodbye Azodye Palace made out of the countless tiny bits and bricks of human effort and adolescent strength these prime UCL students can bear. As a consequence, this social scientist cannot but observe and work quietly in the background. So, I guess for now I'll be the "Geography guy" working on the enigmatic "sociological" stuff that somehow fits into Human Practice, or Policy & Practices as it is now called.  (Please note that today's diary entry particularly serves its purpose as my sarcastic outlet :) ) Kevkey 10:48, 29 July 2014 (CDT)

First proper day at iGEM: I attend a meeting with Darren and he is keen to hear how my art collective is doing. I have taken on a fair bit to do. I need to sort out and neaten this diary, alongside other written material (such as the lab book), produce graphics, and get involved in the code, which Lewis has already kindly sent me.

Edo
I was on time today! Manual labor in the barclays lab, packed everything and moved glassware. Back to old HQ, working on my to-do list which looks something like this:
Sent email to Linden for collaboration and to gene synthesis company to have the clone the gene into our miniprep of the plasmid.
does html like me? YEAH I put a break!
Finished prediction of gels, put them on the drive, it looks like we got something similar to what we expected
Had pasta (no shit, right?)
Tag harrassed people to do their diary. Found a good 3d model visualiser by munich for the wiki, I'll look into it.

Done:
Spoke to Hilary
learn to use bullet points.
Updated lab book
Skype with Hilary was very promising. She gave us some sound advice on changes we should make to our debate and kindly offered to help us by involving more of her contacts.
Next I'm just trying to tidy up the lab book content we have on the drive so it's in a state that can be uploaded cleanly to the wiki </br>To do:
Get hair cut
</br> you can get it for free here, I love them http://www.londonschoolofbarbering.com/book-a-cut/free-haircuts/

Started reading paper on a possible synthetic cofactor that can derive from azodyes, xenobiology becomes cooler and cooler. Fell asleep on my flight so I didn't finish it.

Skyped with Linden Gledhill, he agreed in using his footage in some of our videos as long as we credit him. It was great as he is a biochemist and an artist which makes communication much easier. yes i talked about my algae :) yes he now wants to buy them. Discussed some further time-lapse we could take of decolourised product, what I can do with my microscope, or visualise the change in crystallisation whe bacteria are present. I showed him what previous igem teams/synbio projects have done in arts ( http://www.echromi.com/ , http://www.syntheticaesthetics.org/ ) might give him some inspiration.
The conversation finished talking about zombies and a horror movie that has ferrofluids attacking humanity from the ground. Hope the producers accepts it because it’s fucking awesome.
