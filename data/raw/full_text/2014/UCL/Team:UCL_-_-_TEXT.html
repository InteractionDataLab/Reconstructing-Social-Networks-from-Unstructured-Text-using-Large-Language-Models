OUR PROJECT
We are using Synthetic Biology to beat AZO DYE Pollution.  Azo Dyes are the most common synthetic dye and are used everywhere, from food colouring to clothes. You're probably wearing clothes dyed with Azo-Dyes! But, when they get into waste water, dumped from textile factories, they're very toxic. Our team is engineering bacteria that break down these dyes by producing a group of powerful enzymes. These bacteria make the Dye colourless and safe for the environment
    What we did    
We solidified the SCIENCE in the wet Lab
We MODELLED the data to see the pathways
We designed an entire MANUFACTURING and detoxifying facility
We made our bacteria super safe using our XENOBIOLOGY
We ran an intense investigation into the SOCIOLOGICAL interactions of our team.
We de-mystified the magic of MICROFLUIDICS
We became a player in the PUBLIC AND INDUSTRY
