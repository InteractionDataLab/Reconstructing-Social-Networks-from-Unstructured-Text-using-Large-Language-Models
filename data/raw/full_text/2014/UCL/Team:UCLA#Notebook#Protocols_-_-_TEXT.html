Iterative Capped Assembly
Protocol Paper for Iterative Capped Assembly
Outline
Assemble monomers via PCR and prepare all other oligos, i.e. the initiator, terminator, and capping oligos
Add biotinylated initiator oligo to streptavidin coated beads
Add monomers in desired sequence with T7 DNA ligase, making sure to add blocks with AB, BC, and CA overhangs sequentially. Incorporate a wash step and capping step after adding each monomer
After spider silk sequence has the desired number of repeats, add terminator oligo and elute DNA from beads by heating the reaction
Amplify eluted DNA by PCR with primers that are complementary to the biobrick prefix on the ICA initiator, and the biobrick suffix on the ICA terminator
Ligate purified product into backbone using restriction sites on the prefix and suffix
Materials Fabrication from Bombyx mori
Protocol Paper for Producing Various Silk-based Materials
Outline
Dissolve silk in LiBr Solution
Dialyze silk solution against ultrapure water to remove salts
Dialyzed product will be light yellow and slightly viscous- can be stored in 4&deg C fridge for about a month
For silk film: pour thin layer of dialyzed silk into plate and let dry overnight
For silk pH gels: make a 1 HCl:10 dialyzed silk solution using 1M HCl, and let solidify overnight
For silk fibers:
Option 1: Lyophilize dialyzed silk for 2-3 days. Resuspend lyophilized silk powder in HFIP, and extrude through syringe
Option 2: Redialyze silk solution once more against Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) to concentrate it. Extrude concentrated silk through syringe
