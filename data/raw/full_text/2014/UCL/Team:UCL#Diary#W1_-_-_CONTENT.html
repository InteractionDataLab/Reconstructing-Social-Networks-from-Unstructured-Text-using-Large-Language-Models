Useful things happened there:
Met Vitor Pinheiro and some people from his previous lab, had a chat with Alex Taylor. Interesting to see the opinions of “truly synthetic” biologist (life out chemicals) on iGEM (standardised parts of DNA) side of synthetic biology.
Met Adam Rutherford, he wants to keep in touch with iGEM teams (wrote two chapters on iGEM in his book) and particularly with UCL as it is his Alma Mater. Invited him for our debate (reconfirmed later in the week for the 26th). He coming. (yeey)
Best talk by Pierre-Alain Monnard “Prebiotic amphiphiles, early membranes and protocell functions” and Philip Holliger (Vitor’s best friend) “Towards RNA self-replication
Aything else happened that day?

We have had varying success shown in the lab book but will need to repeat some next week.I also saw how to perform minipreps and nanodrops.
</P><P>Outside of the lab I have been sending out e-mails to biotech companies for sponsorship which will be followed up with calls next week. We have also been contacting various environmental, political and legislative organisations in order to have representatives for our debate in August.

We talked about the cloning strategy in detail and developed an idea of future lab plans. Going to take responsibility for allocating lab weeks to people and having an outline ready for each weeks lab agenda before beginning the lab work for the week. 
Participated in human practice meeting and discussion about obtaining speakers for the debate. 
Went with Edo to a few talks at the origin of life conference and later to the talk by Adam Rutherford. Spoke to him about our project, gave him a business card and invited him to be a speaker at the debate which he was quite receptive to.

In that regard I discussed how iGEM and UCL iGEM 2014 fit into its conceptual and theoretical framework through sustainable governance strategies that try to bridge concerns of security with discourses on ecological modernisation and innovation. I sent this literature review to my MSc dissertation supervisor. <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Kevkey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Kevkey (page does not exist)">Kevkey</A> 09:00, 26 July 2014 (CDT)

We decided on what graphics were needed for the new website design and how they would be taken and then implemented. Also we had a bit of a kerfuffle regarding the deadline of the final site. All in all it was a hectic day but a lot was organized.

He stressed that we should get at least one BioBrick moving which I am taking into account for planning next steps in the lab. After the meeting I read up on the use of microbial fuel cells in degradation of azo-dyes for the meeting in the afternoon. 
</P><P>Went to Westminster with Bioprocessing team (Joy, Maurice, Sanjay) to talk to Godfrey about MFCs and see how this could fit in with our project. Asked a lot of questions as to feasibility and he was extremely forthcoming with help about contacts and papers related to our project. He showed us the MFC prototypes and even offered some materials if we should need them. Told us that university of Reading may have some ready-to-use MFCs which we could procure.
</P><P>After the meeting we re-grouped at Costa to plan our next steps. Decided that we most probably will not pursue the MFC angle as it does not really include azoreductase and current generated is not much. But we will keep it in mind as a possible secondary idea to build on our regular bioprocess. I will be doing literature reviews and research as to how to set up our bioprocess.

Condering that UCL iGEM 2014 is the empirical subject of my dissertation, I started reading more on the various ways in which a social scientist conducts a case study. In addition, I am looking into ethnography as a method especially considering that I am embedding myself as a researcher among a team of students and scientists-in-the-making. Considering that a lot of what they do happens online, I am also consulting some of the literature on ethnography that apply to social media. <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Kevkey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Kevkey (page does not exist)">Kevkey</A> 09:09, 26 July 2014 (CDT)

However, today I found a book that deals with both methods but from the perspective of sustainability research. It even contains an elaborate example of a case study on biosecurity. In the afternoon I went to the Human Practice meeting with the team. We discussed our social media presence on Twitter and just started sending out some tweets with the idea that this tool can also be used to blog - microblog - our thoughts on the subject of synbio. I also asked Lewis about how I could edit my own space of the wiki. Subsequently, I went back to the Science Library to write some of my methodological ideas down and write a bit of the introduction for my methodology chapter. <A href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:Kevkey&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Kevkey (page does not exist)">Kevkey</A> 09:18, 26 July 2014 (CDT)

</P><P>Went to Institute of Making and printed out Azoreductase. I found a way to make it print, now we have the two monomers, I need to finish polishing them and then find a really cool printer and some money to get a really good one printed.
</P><P>Also tried to print the bioreactor BUT met mike (biochemeng postdoc) and just using a jar is just so much better to have an easily deployable bioreactor, then we can print some of the specific pieces. @Joy

Consolidated all of the designs for the new site. Began studying genetic algorithms, cause I felt like it. At this point I had a discussion with the other team members and we are going to make sure the other sites are perfect to give us some more buffer time to get the final site done and pretty. Also began talks with Edo about setting up a blog/diary.

I mean, why not combine the notions security apparatuses and neoliberal governmentality with the ideological discourse of ecological modernisation??
