Function
BBa_K1336000
Azoreductase R2
This part encodes an enzyme for cleaving the N=N bond in azo dyes, identified from Bacillus subtilis ...

BBa_K1336003
Lignin Peroxidase
This part, found in white-rot fungi, participates in lignin-degrading processes, which also plays a role in azo dye degradation and decolourisation ...

BBa_K1336004
Bacillus subtilis dye-decolorizing peroxidase (BsDyP)
This part is a newly discovered enzyme that appears to be effective in degrading lignin and azo dyes, however, its physiological functions have not yet been fully characterised ...
temp image
BBa_K1336005
Pseudomonas putida MET94 dye-decolorizing peroxidase (PpDyP)
This part is another relatively novel enzyme that has not yet been studied in detail, but seems to be able to effectively oxidise many substrates including: azo dyes, anthraquinones, phenolic compounds, manganese, and veratryl alcohol ...
