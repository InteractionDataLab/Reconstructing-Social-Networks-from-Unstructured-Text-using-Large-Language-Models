WHO ARE WE?
We are University College London's iGEM 2014 team.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
We are using Synthetic Biology to combat AZO-DYE Pollution.  Azo Dyes are the most common synthetic dye and are used everywhere, from food colouring to clothes. You're probably wearing clothes dyed with Azo-Dyes! But, when they get into waste water they're very toxic. Our team is engineering bacteria that degrade these dyes, using enzymes, to make them colourless and less harmful to the environment
