Meet the team
Our team for this years iGEM competition consists of an eclectic mix of 21 post-graduate and undergraduate students studying a broad range of subjects in the biological and social sciences. Throughout the summer we received advice and assistance from a number of supervisors and collaborators as well as previous UCL iGEM participants.
As a cross-disciplinary team we were able to combine our talents to create an azo-degrading organism in the laboratory, as well as promote awareness of the role of synthetic biology in tackling the issue of azo dye pollution amongst industry and NGO stakeholders.
