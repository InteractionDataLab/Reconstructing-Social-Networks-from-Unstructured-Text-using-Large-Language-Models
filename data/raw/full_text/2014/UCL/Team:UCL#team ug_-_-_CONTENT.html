I joined iGEM because I find genetic engineering extremely interesting and with a huge range of potential applications, especially with a synthetic biology approach. It is also a great opportunity for me to gain experience in the different elements that have to be brought forward in order to successfully carry out a project. As I have only just completed my first year, my roles within the team will be to support those who are more experienced in their duties, trying to learn as much as possible on the way. In the future, I would like to take further studies like an MSc or PhD, probably related to synthetic biology or genetic engineering. Outside science, my main interests are music, being able to play several instruments, and nature. </P><H3 class="short_headline"><A name="MauriceLink"><SPAN>Maurice Bertrand</SPAN></A></H3><P><B>BEng Biochemical Engineering (2nd Year). </B>As a 2nd Year Biochemical Engineering student, my degree focuses mainly on bioprocess design and optimization, with an emphasis on high value therapeutic production and purification. I have a strong interest in the technical aspects of iGEM and am excited by Synthetic Biology’s vast breadth of theoretical applications. The areas of Public Engagement and Web Design also appeal to me. Within iGEM, I hope to develop strong interpersonal skills and to gain knowledge on effective team management. As a less experienced team member, I plan to contribute mainly by supporting my well-practiced teammates in their efforts to maximize our chances at succeeding in the competition and providing the best learning experience for everyone. </P><H3 class="short_headline"><A name="GeorgiaLink"><SPAN>Georgia Bondy</SPAN></A></H3><P><B>BSc Natural Sciences (2nd Year). </B>At the moment I am studying BSc Natural Sciences and have just completed my second year; specialising in organic chemistry and neuroscience. Prior to this degree, I undertook a module in ‘Genetics and Health Issues’ at the Open University. In 2011, I achieved a regional finalist position for the UK in the Google International Science fair, and I currently work in the Neural Computation Lab in the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research as an Electron Micrograph analyst. In the future, I am interested in undertaking a PhD in biophysics or SynBio. In addition, I compose music, do some graphic design, and bake delicious things (or so I've been told).</P><H3 class="short_headline"><A name="JoyLink"><SPAN>Joy Faucher</SPAN></A></H3><P><B>MEng Biochemical Engineering with Chemical Engineering (2nd Year). </B>I am interested in applying and integrating my knowledge of bioprocessing to an epidemiological context and harnessing this opportunity with Synbio to open up an approach to potential future healthcare solutions. Previously, I have worked on reviewing novel biomarker strategies for the diagnosis of tuberculosis with the French Institute for Research and Development. Aside from my studies, I have a growing interest in cognitive science, enjoy playing music and sports, and have been part of creative/entrepreneurial challenges. Most of all, I enjoy making things! </P><H3 class="short_headline"><A name="EdoardoLink"><SPAN>Edoardo Gianni</SPAN></A></H3><P><B>BSc Biotechnology (1st Year). </B>As a first year biotechnology student, I wanted to jump into iGEM as soon as I got into university. In my last two years of high school, I grew fascinated by synthetic biology as a powerful tool to work on the inner code of living organisms. I became involved in the DIYbio community, where I found sources of knowledge otherwise inaccessible to me, which sparked my interest even more. I thus like to call myself a biohacker, although I have only been able to kill some bioluminescent algae so far. My role within the team will be the official jester, master of 3D printing, and best Italian scientist. I hope that by taking part in iGEM I will finally be able to do myself what I have been reading and reading about, building on what has been done so far, and learning the key skills to help found new teams in the future. When I am not in the lab you will probably find me on a fencing piste, jumping and smiling, or in the UCL Makespace, jumping and smiling. </P><H3 class="short_headline"><A name="SanjayLink"><SPAN>Sanjay Joshi</SPAN></A></H3><P><B>BEng Biochemical Engineering (2nd Year). </B>I currently study Biochemical Engineering, having just completed my second year. The vast range of potential applications and recent developments in synthetic biology enthrals me. iGEM offers me the opportunity to further my interest and gain experience in the field of synthetic biology, as well as acquire the necessary skills to work in a successful and productive interdisciplinary environment throughout the project. Biochemical Engineering serves as an ideal platform to understand the science and function of our iGEM project, as well as scope its potential industrial applications. My future goals are to complete further education in Bioinformatics or Bioprocessing, along with expanding my expertise in business and economics. </P><H3 class="short_headline"><A name="BezLink"><SPAN>Behzad Karkaria</SPAN></A></H3><P><B>BSc Biomedical Sciences (2nd Year). </B>I am currently studying BSc Biomedical Sciences at King's College London; my degree covers a wide range of topics with a focus on gene cloning and cell biology. UCL have been kind enough to offer me a position on their iGEM 2014 team, an experience which I will hopefully use to found a team at my own university. I am excited by the potential of synthetic biology with a specific interest in its application within the medical field, I am intent upon directing my career pathway towards this field. Outside my studies, I play guitar, write as well as watch comedy, and play Ultimate Frisbee. </P><H3 class="short_headline"><A name="NingLink"><SPAN>Ning Lu</SPAN></A></H3><P><B>MEng Biochemical with Chemical Engineering (2nd year). </B>After I was first told the finer details of iGEM competition from a former team member, last year, I could not stop thinking about what a great idea it is to have students from multi-disciplinary backgrounds to complete a project that they have decided between themselves. Therefore, here I am in the UCL iGEM 2014 team, ready for any tough challenges. I have recently finished my second year in Biochemical Engineering. With a moderate amount of lab experience and my own fascination, I am looking forward to helping out in the lab, as well as with public engagement. Dancing and doodling has always had a part in my life and I rather enjoy performing on a stage after my first stage experience at 6. Beside all these, I still believe a game of DOTA never hurts!  </P><H3 class="short_headline"><A name="LewisILink"><SPAN>Lewis Iain Moffat</SPAN></A></H3><P><B>MEng Biochemical Engineering and Bioprocess Management (1st Year). </B> I have just completed my first year of a combined Bachelors and Masters programme in Biochemical Engineering and Bioprocess Engineering (MEng). I am absolutely fascinated by synthetic biology and its infinite range of applications; as such, I am really looking forward to being a part of the UCL iGEM 2014 team. In the future, I hope to complete a further Masters or Doctorate in bioinformatics or biomedical engineering and go on to work in the venture capital industry. Aside from my degree, my academic passions also stretch to computer science, literature, and economics. All of which I have had the opportunity to study at a higher level. Combined with my love of sports, video games, science fiction and fantasy, I hope to bring all of my passion and energy to our iGEM team so that we have the best project possible. </P><H3 class="short_headline"><A name="PamelaLink"><SPAN>Pamela Niem</SPAN></A></H3><P><B>BSc Biomedical Sciences (2nd Year). </B>I am currently studying for a Biomedical Sciences BSc and have just completed my second year, specialising in integrative physiology and anatomy. I became interested in synthetic biology due to its huge variety of applications, with my interest particularly focusing on the development of innovative methods for treating disease. In the UCL iGEM 2014 team, I am involved with human practice, public engagement, art/design, and assisting with wet lab. Other than science, I love playing the guitar and piano, singing my feelings, and eating brownies. </P><H6>Continue on to: <A href="/Team:UCL/team">Meet The Team, Part 2: the Postgrads</A></H6><H6>Photography by Maysie Milbourn</H6></DIV><SECTION class="span3 sidebar secondary-column" id="secondary-nav"><ASIDE class="widget"><H5 class="short_headline"><SPAN>Meet the team</SPAN></H5><UL class="navigation"><LI><A href="/Team:UCL/team_ug#DanielLink">Daniel de la Torre</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:UCL/team_ug#MauriceLink">Maurice Bertrand</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:UCL/team_ug#GeorgiaLink">Georgia Bondy</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:UCL/team_ug#JoyLink">Joy Faucher</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:UCL/team_ug#EdoardoLink">Edoardo Gianni</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:UCL/team_ug#SanjayLink">Sanjay Joshi</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:UCL/team_ug#BezLink">Bez Karkaria</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:UCL/team_ug#NingLink">Ning Lu</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:UCL/team_ug#LewisILink">Lewis Iain Moffat</A></LI><LI><A href="/Team:UCL/team_ug#PamelaLink">Pamela Niem</A></LI></UL></ASIDE></SECTION></DIV></DIV><FOOTER id="footer" class="clearfix"><DIV class="container"><DIV class="row-fluid"><DIV class="span4"><SECTION><H4>Contact Us</H4><P>University College London - Gower Street - London - WC1E 6BT - Biochemical Engineering Department<STRONG>phone:</STRONG><A href="tel:phonenum" class="tele">+44 (0)20 7679 2000</A><STRONG>email:</STRONG><A href="ucligem2014@gmail.com">ucligem2014@gmail.com</A></P></SECTION></DIV><DIV class="span4"><SECTION><H4>Follow Us</H4></SECTION></DIV><DIV class="span4"><SECTION class="tweets"><H4>Tweets</H4></SECTION><A class="twitter-timeline" href="http://twitter.com/UCLiGEM" data-widget-id="345217160337039361">Tweets by @UCLiGEM</A></DIV></DIV></DIV><SECTION class="footerCredits"><DIV class="container"><UL class="clearfix"><LI>© 2014 UCL iGEM.
