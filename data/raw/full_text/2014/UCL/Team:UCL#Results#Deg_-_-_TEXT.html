Degradation
In order to determine the compatibility of our BBa_K1336003 BsDyP Azo-degradation module, we set out to investigate the growth performance of E.coli DH5α containing our BioBrick in different media. We then set out to investigate the functionality of our Azo-degradation module in decolourising several model Azo-dye contaminated waste-waters.
Figure 1 - BBa_K1336003 BsDyP Azo-degradation module preserves growth performance of E.coli DH5α in LB media. Graph showing that E.coli transformed with the BBa_K1336003 BsDyP Azo-degradation module shows comparable growth the plasmid-free control in LB media. OD measured at 680nm and Time is shown in hours after incubation. Error bars indicate SEM, n=2.
Figure 2 - BBa_K1336003 BsDyP Azo-degradation module is compatible with Acid Orange 7 (AO7) dye-contaminated waste waters. Graph showing that E.coli transformed with the BBa_K1336003 BsDyP Azo-degradation module is able to grow in LB media contaminated with AO7 dye. Please note that OD measurements are considerably higher in dye-contaminated waters due to the absorbance of the azo-dye. OD measured at 680nm and Time is shown in hours after incubation. Error bars indicate SEM, n=2.
Figure 3 - BBa_K1336003 BsDyP Azo-degradation module is compatible with Reactive Black 5 (RB5) dye-contaminated waste waters. Graph showing that E.coli transformed with the BBa_K1336003 BsDyP Azo-degradation module is able to grow in LB media contaminated with RB5 dye. Please note that OD measurements are considerably higher in dye-contaminated waters due to the absorbance of the azo-dye. OD measured at 680nm and Time is shown in hours after incubation. Error bars indicate SEM, n=2.

Figure 4 - BBa_K1336007 BsDyP Azo-degradation module is capable of degrading Acid Orange 7 (AO7) dye-contaminated waste waters. Graph showing that in comparison to the plasmid free control, E.coli transformed with the BBa_K1336007 BsDyP Azo-degradation module is able to decolourise AO7 dye contaminated LB media after being induced by 1mM IPTG. Inoculations were grown at 37 degrees and 180rpm for 24 hours and then left stationary for a further 24 hours at room temperature. OD680nm measurements were taken of the supernatant at the end of the 48 hour experiment. Error bars indicate SEM, n=2.
Figure 5 - BBa_K1336007 BsDyP Azo-degradation module is capable of degrading Reactive Black 5 (RB5) dye-contaminated waste waters. Graph showing that in comparison to the plasmid free control, E.coli transformed with the BBa_K1336007 BsDyP Azo-degradation module is able to decolourise RB5 dye-contaminated LB media after being induced by 1mM IPTG. Inoculations were grown at 37 degrees and 180rpm for 24 hours and then left stationary for a further 24 hours at room temperature. OD680nm measurements were taken of the supernatant at the end of the 48 hour experiment. Error bars indicate SEM, n=2.
Lignin Peroxidase - BBa_K500000
In order to widen our Azo-degrading and de-colourising toolbox, we also set out to investigate whether we could incorporate the Lignin Peroxidase (BBa_K500000) BioBrick submitted by Tianjin iGEM 2010 into our project and provide further characterisation. While we were able to get this fragment synthesised and sent to us, the toxicity of the DNA fragment in E.coli prevented us from obtaining any decolourisation data. However, we were still able to further characterise the experimental use of (BBa_K500000) in E.coli.
Figure 6 - Lignin Peroxidase BBa_K500000 BioBrick is toxic in E.coli DH5α. Graph showing that while it was possible to confirm the sucessful synthesis of BBa_K500000 in vitro, it was not possible to carry out any in vivo transformations of the DNA fragment into E.coli DH5α.
