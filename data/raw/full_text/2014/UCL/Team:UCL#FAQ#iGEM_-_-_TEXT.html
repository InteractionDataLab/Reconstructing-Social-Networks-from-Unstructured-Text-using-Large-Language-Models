The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition
iGEM is a synthetic biology competition where teams from around the
world aim to design and build a biological system out of standardised, interchangeable parts.
The iGEM foundation aids this by creating the Registry of Standard Biological Parts , a library of characterised genetic sequences which perform desired functions. These standardised components ( BioBricks ) are formatted in a way which enables them to be easily put together so users can mix and match genes to create an organism displaying a unique set of functions. Teams re-use existing BioBricks, as well as designing new ones, in order to create genetically engineered machines.
These engineered systems can potentially be used for a range of applications: from medical uses such as the tailored release of insulin for the treatment of diabetes to resolving global environmental issues by mass production of biofuels from renewable sources.

This year, the UCL iGEM tackles an environmental problem: the pollution of waterways by industrial azo-dye disposal. This addresses the pressing need to clean up industrial effluents of these carcinogenic derivatives before being released into the environment, and thus keeping our water systems clean.

UCL has been involved in iGEM since 2009
Previous UCL iGEM teams include Spotless Mind (Gold), Darwin Toolbox , Plastic Republic (Gold), E. coili (Bronze), Hypoxon (Gold), and Stress Busters (Silver).
As a result of competing in iGEM for over 5 years, UCL has developed a community of synthetic biologists. Our team this year has been lucky to benefit from the advice and experience of past iGEM teams, as well as enjoy the summer working alongside students from all disciplines.
