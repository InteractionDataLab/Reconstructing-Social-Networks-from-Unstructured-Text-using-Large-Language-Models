Where am I on iGEM?
 Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device, document this in the "Experience" section of its entry in the iGEM Registry, and submit the part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
  Meet our Team!
  Team Roster!
 Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institute, e.g. characterising a part, debugging a construct, or modelling/simulating their system.
  Our Achievements!
  iGEM Judging form!
 Describe a novel approach of our team to help us and others consider the implications/aspects of the design and outcomes of synthetic biology efforts; justifying its novelty and how this approach might be adapted and scaled for others to use.

Bronze Medal
We registered our team!
We have completed the Judging form!
Our team wiki is here!
We have prepared a Poster and a Talk for the iGEM Giant Jamboree!
Our team attributions can be found here, with our external collaborators , and sponsors
Our new BioBrick Parts and Devices have been assembled, characterised, and documented!
Silver Medal
Our new BioBrick Parts and Devices have been experimentally validated , and work as expected!
We documented the characterisation of these parts in the iGEM Parts Registry: BBa_1366003 , BBa_1366005 , BBa_1366006 , BBa_1366007 .
We submitted those new parts to the iGEM Parts Registry.
We discussed how our project could have implications for the environment, security, safety, ethics, ownership and data sharing. Find out more about this in our Sociological Imaginations page!
Gold Medal
We improved the function and characterisation of existing BioBrick Parts , and entered this new information into the Registry. However, this has not been submitted to the registry.
We collaborated with other registered iGEM teams.
We outlined and detailed a new approach to tack the issues of biosafety in the field of Synthetic Biology. We also explained our
story...
