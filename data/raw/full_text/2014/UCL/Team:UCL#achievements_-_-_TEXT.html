Bronze
Team registration.
Complete Judging form.
Team wiki.
We will present our project poster and talk at the iGEM Giant Jamboree, 30 October - 3 November 2014.
Use of new/improved application of previously existing standard BioBrick Part or Device, and submitted to the iGEM Registry.
Silver (in addition to Bronze Medal requirements)
Experimental validation that at least one of our new Biobrick Part(s) or Device(s) works as expected.
Characterisation of working Biobrick(s) documented in the "Main Page" section of its Part's/Device's Registry Entry.
New part submitted to iGEM Parts Registry (adhering to the iGEM Registry guidelines).
Implications of our project to the environment, security, safety and ethics, and/or ownership and sharing. Also, description of one or more ways these, or broader, implications have been taken into consideration in the design and execution of our project.
Gold (in addition to Bronze Medal requirements, any one or more of the following)
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device, document this in the "Experience" section of its entry in the iGEM Registry, and submit the part to the iGEM Parts Registry.
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institute, e.g. characterising a part, debugging a construct, or modelling/simulating their system.
Describe a novel approach of our team to help us and others consider the implications/aspects of the design and outcomes of synthetic biology efforts; justifying its novelty and how this approach might be adapted and scaled for others to use.
