Uploading an Image and Putting it in a Page
1. Make sure you have a saved version of the image on your device ready to upload
2. Go to Special:Upload and upload the image.
3. After the upload has taken place you will be linked to a page with the image which gives you options to update versions of the image etc. If you click on the image it will take you to a link with just the image. The url of this image is what you will use in a page to insert the image so make sure you take not of it before closing the tab.
4. An example of an inputted image is <img class="alignright" src="http:// 2014.igem.org/wiki/images/0/01/LewisBPhotoEd.png" alt=" " height=300 width=225> This inputs an image of Lewis B. The source url is what tells the page where to take the image from.
