Acknowledgements & Attributions
The UCL iGEM 2014 team would like to thank all our advisors who have assisted us throughout the project, and without whom the project would not have been possible. We would also like to thank all everyone else who has helped us realise this project, be it through invaluable advice or providing DNA, equipment, or other materials. These contributions have helped us enormously. All work on this wiki was carried out and all data collected by us unless stated otherwise. For a full list of our collaborations & acknowledgements, please visit our collaborations page.
Our work and achievements can be split into 6 categories, each representing the different aspects of our immense project. During the early days of our project, we identified the different sub-teams we would be working in, and since then a lot of members have contributed to almost all aspects of the project.
