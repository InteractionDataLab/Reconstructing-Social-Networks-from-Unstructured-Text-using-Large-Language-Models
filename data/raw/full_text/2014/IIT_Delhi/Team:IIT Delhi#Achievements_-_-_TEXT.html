✔ We articulated important questions encountered by our team, described how our team considered these questions within your project and evaluated the approach used by our team. We also included attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.
Question 1: What constitutes suitable and unsuitable use of organisms by humans? Should organisms be ever used in research? Do organisms have "rights" as we have human rights?
Question 2:Going from genetic manipulation in microorganism to plants, animals and humans. Should we mark a line cautioning genetic manipulation and put a bound at some point ?
Question 3: When we create a GMO, what motive we have in our mind? Commercial, Humanitarian, inquisitiveness, professional honor, national interest, to improve mankind etc. !
Question 4: Is there any feasibility of homologous recombination of our biobricks into other organisms if it gets released into biosphere ?
