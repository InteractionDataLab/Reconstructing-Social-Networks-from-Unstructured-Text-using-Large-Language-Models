Team:GES NCSU Raleigh NC/Attributions
From 2014.igem.org
North Carolina State University Genetic Engineering & Society Center iGEM Team
We are working with Antony Evans of the Glowing Plant Project to explore what it means to act responsibly with respect to genetic engineering. Specifically, we propose an iterative concept mapping framework to assess the values that people associate with responsibly releasing genetically engineered plants beyond the laboratory.
