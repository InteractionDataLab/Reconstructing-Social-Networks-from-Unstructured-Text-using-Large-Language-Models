Specifically, we developed an iterative concept mapping tool that prompts people to articulate the values that guide their own definitions of responsible innovation, and to consider their values in relation to other people’s. This first version focuses on values associated with genetically engineered plants, but over time, our tool will also become relevant to other emerging technologies. We developed the tool with help from the developers of <A href="http://www.glowingplant.com/|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">The Glowing Plant</SPAN></A>, the world’s first and only crowd-funded genetically engineered organism.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Project_Details"> Project Details </SPAN></H2><P>Our tool is inspired by Science and Technology Studies scholarship that demonstrates the inadequacy of defining “risk” in narrow, purely technical terms (Beck, 1992; Luhmann, 1990).  Social and cultural values guide the development and diffusion of new technologies (Pinch and Bijker, 1987; Rogers, 2003). Although the term “responsibility” is pervasive in discussions about emerging technologies, defining what it means to act responsibly is actually quite difficult, as different people have different views about what courses of action would be more or less responsible. “Responsibility” can indicate causation, suggesting that a person has made something happen, but it can also suggest legal obligation or liability, as well as moral obligation or ethical duty (Giddens, 1999, p. 8). In light of this complexity, we define Responsible Research and Innovation as “a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view on the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and social desirability” of products and the social processes that surround them (von Schomberg, 2011, p. 9). 
</P><P>By modeling the principles that different people associate with responsible innovation, we hope to facilitate this type of responsiveness. Much like deliberative mapping (Burgess, Stirling, Clark, Davies, Eames, Staley &amp; Williamson, 2007), collaborative modeling helps to open up space for dialogue that incorporates diverse values, promotes understanding, and enables broader agreement on the causes of problems (Cockerill, Daniel, Malczynski &amp; Tidwell, 2009). By prompting people to reflect on their core values, our tool may help users develop <A href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reflective-equilibrium/|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">reflective equilibrium</SPAN></A> by harmonizing their belief systems and actions (Deplazes, Ganguli-Mitra &amp; Biller-Andorno, 2009, p. 72). 
</P><P>At the iGEM competition, we will present the first version of our tool, which includes two parts: a <A href="http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1N8JJ5RQC-20S7ZN-44Z8/Main%20Map.cmap|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">concept map</SPAN></A> and a digital <A href="http://go.ncsu.edu/igem2014app" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">app</SPAN></A>. The <A href="http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1N8JJ5RQC-20S7ZN-44Z8/Main%20Map.cmap|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">concept map</SPAN></A> outlines principles that can guide responsible innovation, such as <A href="http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1N8JS87CS-11BY8ZT-4770/Regulatory%20Requirements.cmap|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">meeting regulatory requirements</SPAN></A>, preserving human health and safety, advancing innovation, and promoting social equity. The <A href="http://go.ncsu.edu/igem2014app" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">app</SPAN></A> helps users identify which of these principles they value most by asking them to weigh the importance of a series of statements that speak to each principle. This first version of the tool prompts users to articulate values related to <A href="http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1NBWK6BQX-GBTM2M-1Z77/Promote%20Entrepreneurship%20and%20Innovation.cmap|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">advancing entrepreneurship and innovation</SPAN></A>, <A href="http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1NCS2DN2M-RK43B2-1ZC0/Secure%20Legitimacy%20and%20Public%20Trust.cmap|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">securing public legitimacy and trust</SPAN></A>, and <A href="http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1N8JLSQS5-258W2ZC-4572/Promote%20Biodiversity.cmap|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">promoting biodiversity</SPAN></A>. Over time, we will also add additional measures. After completing the weighing process, users can return to the concept map to learn more about various principles. In future versions, we plan to integrate the <A href="http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1N8JJ5RQC-20S7ZN-44Z8/Main%20Map.cmap|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">concept map</SPAN></A> and the <A href="http://go.ncsu.edu/igem2014app" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">app</SPAN></A> into a single interactive online tool.
</P><P>Throughout the competition, we will be inviting fellow competitors and judges to test drive the current version of our tool by exploring the <A href="http://cmapspublic2.ihmc.us/rid=1N8JJ5RQC-20S7ZN-44Z8/Main%20Map.cmap|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">concept map</SPAN></A> and weighing the values statements that are included in our <A href="http://go.ncsu.edu/igem2014app" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">app</SPAN></A>. The data that we collect through this <A href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:GES_NCSU_Raleigh_NC/Safety#Safety_and_Human_Subjects|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">research</SPAN></A> will help us improve the tool, while also contributing to ongoing discussions about the governance of emerging technologies, and specifically, the governance of synthetic biology.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Methods_and_Assumptions"> Methods and Assumptions </SPAN></H2><P>Drawing on the diversity of our team (which includes PhD students in Genetics; Public Administration; Public Policy; Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology; Entomology; Communication; and Computer Science), we used a concept-mapping approach to develop a research question and identify an initial list of criteria needed to answer our question (Novak &amp; Cañas, 2008), then conducted a series of literature reviews to refine and build upon this list. We used <A href="http://cmap.ihmc.us/|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">Cmap concept mapping software</SPAN></A> to incorporate the revised set of criteria into an interactive online concept map and developed an app that enables users to weigh our principles according to their own value systems. Finally, the developers of <A href="http://www.glowingplant.com/|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">The Glowing Plant</SPAN></A> tested the tool and help us refine it.
</P><P>A key assumption that underlies our tool is that values can be measured quantitatively. We recognize that this quantitative approach cannot fully account for the complexity of value systems. Some people may interpret our tool as assuming that it is possible to release genetically engineered organisms beyond the laboratory in a responsible manner. However, we believe that ultimately, future versions of our tool will be able to reflect the values of people who don't think that responsible release is possible.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Challenges"> Challenges </SPAN></H2><P>Like all concept maps, ours shows only a fraction of the concepts that could help answer the question of what it means to act responsibly (Novak &amp; Cañas, 2008, p. 12). Similarly, the current version of our app speaks to only a handful of the principles in our concept map--an issue that we will address in future versions. Both tools are also biased towards our team members’ values and priorities.
</P><P>On a theoretical level, we struggled to translate complex principles such as “promote ethics and social equity” into simple statements to measure users’ value systems. On a pragmatic level, we struggled to find online concept mapping software that allowed users to weigh different concepts according to their values. Finally, inviting the developers of The Glowing Plant to serve as beta testers illustrated the tensions between various principles and helped us to see that it is difficult for a small corporation with limited resources to prioritize principles such as securing public trust and legitimacy that may require significant public outreach. We plan to refine the tool to better address these challenges in the future. We also invite iGEM participants and judges, as well as other users, to provide additional constructive criticism to strengthen the tool further.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Who_Should_Be_Interested_In_This_Tool"> Who Should Be Interested In This Tool </SPAN></H2><P>Because our tool enables people to compare their own values to the values of others, it provides opportunities for people with opposing value systems to discuss their differences respectfully, making it useful to people working in sometimes-controversial areas such as genetic engineering and synthetic biology. As the tool evolves, it may prove useful in other fields and in educational contexts. In addition, other iGEM teams may be interested in expanding upon and modifying our work to explore the different value systems that people draw on as they consider social, cultural and ethical questions related to synthetic biology or other forms of science.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="How_Does_Our_Project_Relate_To_Other_iGEM_Projects.3F"> How Does Our Project Relate To Other iGEM Projects? </SPAN></H2><P>Our project draws on the work of several previous iGEM teams, including the <A href="https://2009.igem.org/Team:UCSF/Human_Practices#Section_2_.E2.80.93_Biotech_classes_in_H|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">2009 UCSF</SPAN></A> team’s investigations into potential safety issues associated with conducting synthetic biology experiments outside of academic or corporate settings and the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh/Human_Practices|" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><SPAN style="color:#CC2200;">2012 Edinburgh</SPAN></A> team’s efforts to increase the accessibility and user-friendliness of synthetic biology.
