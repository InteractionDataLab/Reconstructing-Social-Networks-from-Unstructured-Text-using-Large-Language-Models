North Carolina State University Genetic Engineering & Society Center iGEM Team
We are working with Antony Evans of the Glowing Plant Project to explore what it means to act responsibly with respect to genetic engineering. Specifically, we propose an iterative concept mapping framework to assess the values that people associate with responsibly releasing genetically engineered plants beyond the laboratory.

Team Profile
The North Carolina State University Genetic Engineering and Society IGEM team is made up of a diverse group of PhD students whose interests range from genetics to public administration and from entomology to communication.  We created a web-based interactive values mapping tool to help people articulate and reflect on what it means to innovate responsibly.
