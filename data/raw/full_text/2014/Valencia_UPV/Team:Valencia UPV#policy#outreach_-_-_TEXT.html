Workshop announcement
“Generación Espontánea UPV”
Valencia UPV iGEM team participated in the communication and diffusion activity called Generación Espontánea (translated as Spontaneous Generation). Twenty-four teams of students showed their projects related to different areas: engineering, social, computing, architecture and culture. We presented our Sexy Plant, and made diffusion of Synthetic Biology. Generación Espontánea was organized by UPV and Dr. Larisa Dunai, who was awarded by MIT Technology Review with the MIT Young Innovator under 35 Award of this year.

Summer 2014 School courses
Valencia UPV iGEM team introduced The Sexy Plant Project to students between 10 -15 years old, during this summer.  Besides, we organised an activity for students to learn the pH scale using a natural indicator based on anthocyanins obtained from plants.  Around one hundred students extrated anthocyanins from a red cabagge, and created a natural pH indicator.

See our Lipdub at IBMCP labs!
We have organized and participated in a Lipdub. Our team wanted to involve the different groups that are currently working on the institute that is hosting us (IBMCP) in a different manner. We celebrated the 10th anniversary of the iGEM competition and the 20th anniversary of the IBMCP, too. We spend a great time with our colleagues and we promoted social relationships between us. As a result we did not only achieve an awesome video, but found a magnificent way to popularize science in society.
