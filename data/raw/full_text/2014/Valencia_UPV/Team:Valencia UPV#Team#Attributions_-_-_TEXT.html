Project: the idea. We came to The Sexy Plant project after many brainstorming meetings including all the team. It would be impossible to define authors here: we all contributed to the design of the project.
Pheromone Biosynthesis. Design of the biosynthesis pathway fell on Jose Gavaldá and Lucía Estellés. Pheromone expression analysis by GC-MS was carried out by Alba Rubert, Alfredo Quijano, Lucía Estellés and Jose Gavaldá. Pheromone-insect interaction analysis by means of wind tunnel and EAG was made by Alba Rubert and Alfredo Quijano.
Pheromone Release and Switch. Alfredo Quijano was the responsible for the design and expression analysis of the trichome specific promoter. Copper inducible switch was designed by Alfredo Quijano.
Modeling. Ivan Llopis, also supported by Alejandra González, worked in the FBA modeling to try to obtain estimation of the pheromone production and to try to optimize it. Alejandra González was in charge of the pheromone diffusion and moth behavior modeling to help decide where and how much sexy plants we should put in the field.
Biosafety. Biosafety module was designed by Lucía Estellés, and Lucía was also the leader when fulfilling safety requirements: About our lab form (assisted by Alba, Alfredo and Jose), Check-in and Safety form.
Policy & Practices. Lucía Estellés, Jose Gavaldá, Alejandra González, Alba Rubert and Alfredo Quijano dealed with the organization and execution of interviews with some stakeholders involved in the project. All the students in the team participated in the presentation of the Sexy Plant project to relevant members of the UPV, CSIC (Spanish Research Council) and Bayer CropScience business chair. Alba Rubert, Alfredo Quijano, Alejandra González and Ivan Llopis participated in the Generación Espontánea event. Also all the students organized and carry out the Summer School courses. And Lucía, Jose, Alba and Alfredo organized and participated in the lipdub.
BioBricks. Lucía Estellés, helped by Alba Rubert, prepared the BioBricks for sending them to the Registry and documented the parts. Lucía was the designer of the Omega undercover part used to translate from GoldenBraid 2.0 to BioBricks standard.
Interlab Study. Lucía Estellés performed the measurement interlab study.
Art and Design. Alfredo Quijano was the major designer of the images used at the wiki, the presentation and the poster.
Wiki. Performed by Ivan Llopis.
Poster. Ivan Llopis worked in the poster design, all contributed with the concepts.
Talk. Lucía Estelles, Alfredo Quijano and Alejandra González. Also Alba Rubert performed Lucía's part when she was absent. All the team participated in the layout and conceptual flow.
Supervision
All the Valencia UPV supervisors and advisors performed outstanding jobs. Their implication in the project is as follows:
Wetlab work. It was supervised by Estefanía Huet and Marta Vázquez. Always under the guidance and supervision of the wetlab director: Prof. Diego Orzáez.
Modeling. FBA analysis was closely supervised by Yadira Boada, with the collaboration of Gabriel Bosque and Maria Siurana. Under the guidance of Profs. Javier Urchueguía and Jesús Picó. . Modeling of the Pheromone Diffusion and Moths response was supervised by Alejandro Vignoni. All under the guidance of Profs. Jesús Picó and Alberto Conejero.
Wiki. Supervised by Victor Nina and Alejandro Vignoni.
Communication and logistics. Javier Urchieguía, Alberto Conejero, Maria Siurana, David Fuente and Yadira Boada.
Poster design and layout was supervised by Yadira Boada.
