The Sexy Plant can also be seen as a circuit which can be introduced into other chassis plants to make them sexier. We believe that choosing a chassis plant with certain features, depending on the environmental conditions, could improve the performance of the original Sexy Plant in Nicotiana benthamiana. These are the most important features a chassis plant should have in order to increase the system’s performance:
Low resources requirements: water, fertilizer, space... to avoid disturbances to the crop.
Compatible with the crop and the geographical situation.
High amount of glandular trichomes, so diffusion is increased.
High levels of substrate, pheromone production can reach high levels.
Tall enough to shelter crops (pheromones tend to move down).
Selected plant variety not present in the local area to avoid cross-pollination.
