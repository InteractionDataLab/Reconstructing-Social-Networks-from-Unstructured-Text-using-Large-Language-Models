David Fuente
He's a Chemical Engineer, MSc. in Systems Biology and at the present doing a PhD in dynamic modelling of photosynthesis at the Polytechnic University of Valencia.
He likes learning new concepts of the biologist and experimental part. Moreover, he has been participating in the iGEM competition since 2011, that year as student and the rest as advisor. So he is a little bit masochist.
