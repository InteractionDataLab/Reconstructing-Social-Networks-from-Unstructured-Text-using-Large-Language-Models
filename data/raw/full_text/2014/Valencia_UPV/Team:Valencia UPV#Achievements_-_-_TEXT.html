As it can bee observed surfing our wiki, at the end of this long road we have accomplished many positive results:
A plant able to produce three insect sexual pheromones from moths to produce insects mating disruption, the Sexy Plant.: Results: Pheromone analysis
Obtained pheromones being among the most abundant plant organic volatile compounds. (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol is certainly the most abundant one.
Successful and functional assembly of each of the pheromone biosynthetic genes with the plant constitutive promoter P35S. Also multigenic assembly of all three transcription units in a single plasmid. Results: Constructs-Biosynthesis
Proof of our produced pheromones-insect interaction. Results: Electroantennography
A broad understanding of plant metabolism, by adapting and exploitation of a genome-scale model of Arabidopsis thaliana primary metabolism able to help us theoretically optimize the pheromone production Modeling: Pheromone Production
Adapting the AraGEM genome-scale model to our pheromone production pathway by branching the flux of our precursor metabolite Palmitic acid (16:0).
Identifying the principal: i) cell compartments and scenarios of the plant metabolism, ii) flux bounds and constraints for each scenario, and iii) the interactions between chemical reactions and substrates related to our pheromone.
Exploring genetic conditions that could improve our pheromone production by Single gene Knock-out analysis.
Obtaining optimal condition  for the coupled yield of pheromone and biomass production as a function of photons consumption.
A plant potentially able to release the produced pheromones into the environment.
Successful cloning of a trichome-specific promoter (PCPS2) from the genome of N. tabacum and subsequent assembly with GFP as a reporter. Results: Constructs-Pheromone release
Proof of the specificity of this promoter by GFP fluorescence detection. Results: Trichome-specific expression
Assembly of each gene of the pheromones production pathway with PCPS2 promoter and multigenic assembly with all three transcription units in a single plasmid. Results: Constructs-Pheromone release
A Simulation Environment for the pheromone diffusion and moth response behaviour to help us decide where and how much sexy plants we should put in the field. Modeling: Pheromone Diffusion and Moths Response
Implementing an approximation of the diffusion process by the heat diffusion equation and its numerical solution.
Incorporating an approximation of the moth response behavior including female pheromone release into the environment, and male pheromone concentration sensitivity (that allows the male to follow the trace of females).
Adding our sexy plants that produce and release pheromone triggering mating disruption.
Designing a simulation platform available to community that is useful for exploration of parameters and scenarios related with chemical ecology models.
A genetic switch able to control gene expression ready to be implemented in the plant.
Cloning of the coding sequence from the CUP2 transcription factor from S cerevisiae and assembly with the CaMV constitutive promoter P35S. Results: Construct-Switch
Creation of the Cupper-responsive chimeric promoter and assembly with Firefly luciferase gene as a reporter, P19 as a gene silencing suppressor, and Renilla luciferase as control for Luciferase expression assay. Results: Construct-Switch
Multigenic assembly comprising the CUP2 transcriptional unit with the chimeric promoter and reporter gene assembly. Results: Construct-Switch
A sterile and dark purple plant safe for living beings and the environment. Biosafety
Multigenic assembly of two biosafety devices, comprising the Barnase (male-sterility) with one chromoprotein in each device, AmilCP or AmilGFP (identity preservation). Results: Constructs-Biosafety
Purple plant to preserve its identity expressing SlANT1 and SlJAF13 transcription factors. Results: Biosafety
Diffusion and communication of the project with involved experts and stakeholders. Policy and Practices
