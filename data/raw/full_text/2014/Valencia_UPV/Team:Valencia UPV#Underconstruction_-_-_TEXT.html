The Valencia_UPV team presents:Sexy Plant
The Sexy Plant offers a sustainable alternative to current pest management and  crop protection techniques, which nowadays rely on pesticides and chemically   synthetized pheromones, which are chemical signals that insects use to   communicate.
We are developing a synthetic plant capable of producing insect sexual   pheromones and releasing them into the air. High concentration of sexual   pheromones into the air prevent male insects from finding the females. Using   this mate disruption strategy, damage in crops caused by larvae is avoided.
Since the Sexy Plant is implemented with a genetic switch and a biosafety   module, it rises as a strong, safe and environmentally friendly candidate as the   pest management method of the future.
