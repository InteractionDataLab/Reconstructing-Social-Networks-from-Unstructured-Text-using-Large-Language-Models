<groupparts>iGEM014 Valencia_UPV</groupparts>
BBa_K1554000 – Ta29 Promoter
The Ta29 promoter is anther-specific. Anthers are the male organs of the flower, and their function is to produce pollen. A cytotoxic gene (barnase, ipt, RIP...) is usually used under the control of this specific promoter leading to a plant unable to produce pollen, inducing male-sterility. See Biosafety
BBa_K1554001 – AtrΔ11
The AtrΔ11 protein is a delta-11-desaturase from Amyelois transitella that introduces an unsaturation between C11 and C12 in long-chain fatty acids. This DNA sequence underwent codon usage optimization for Nicotiana benthamiana. Acyl-CoA + Reduced acceptor + O2 = Delta11-acyl-CoA + Acceptor + 2 H2O This part was used in the Insect sexual pheromone production pathway. See Biosynthesis
BBa_K1554002 – HarFAR
The HarFAR protein is a fatty acid reductase that catalyses the conversion of a long-chain fatty acid carboxyl group to an alcohol group. The DNA sequence was obtained from Helicoverpa armigera HarFAR-3 protein, including an Endoplasmic Reticulum retention signal (KKYR) in the C-terminal end. In addition, codon usage optimization was performed for Nicotiana benthamiana. This part was used in the Insect sexual pheromone production pathway. See Biosynthesis
BBa_K1554003 – EaDAcT
The EaDAcT protein is a diacylglycerol acetyltransferase coming from Euonymus alatus. This enzyme can transform alcohol gropus from fatty acid to aldehyde gropus. This DNA sequence underwent codon usage optimization for Nicotiana benthamiana. This part was used in the Insect sexual pheromone production pathway. See Biosynthesis
BBa_K1554004 – Yellow biosafety module for plants
This biosafety device for plants consists of two submodules: a male sterility submodule and an identity preservation submodule. The male sterility submodule consists of a barnase specifically expressed in anthers under the regulation of the TA29 tapetum-specific promoter. As result, pollen from these plants is not fertile. The identity preservation submodule expresses the yellow chromoprotein AmilGFP, so that plants can be visually differentiated from non-transgenic plants. See Results: Constructs-Biosafety
BBa_K1554005 - Blue biosafety module for plants
This biosafety device is composed of the same parts as the previously explained one, BBa_K1554004. This device uses AmilCP as chromoprotein instead of AmilGFP. See Results: Constructs-Biosafety
BBa_K1554006 - Omega Undercover
The Omega undercover vector allows the conversión of GoldenBraid standard parts to BioBrick’s. See Methodology: Parts construction
