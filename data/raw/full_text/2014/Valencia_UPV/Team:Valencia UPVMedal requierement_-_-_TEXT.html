Bronze Medal Requirements:
Bronze Medal Requirements:      Team registration.     Team is registered!     Team Wiki.     Our wiki is up! While designing and building our wiki from scratch, we kept in mind ways to facilitate future iGEM teams' web development. This page layout is therefore easily replicable, while allowing for lots of functionality - take a look at our source code and see for yourself!     Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree.     Poster ready to go!     The description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the students and distinguish it from work done by others, including host labs, advisors, instructors, sponsors, professional website designers, artists, and commercial services.     See our attributions here!     Document at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device used in your project/central to your project and submit this part to the iGEM Registry.     See our parts here!    Silver Medal Requirements: In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements,      Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.     See our Parts page and Lab book .pdf!     Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.     See our parts here!     Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).     See our parts here!     iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted.     In our Policy and Practices, we extensively explore the pressing issues surrounding synthetic biology: 'Environmental Impact', 'Intellectual Property' 'Communication' and 'Public Engagement'.    Gold Medal Requirements: In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements,      Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry.     Poster ready to go!     Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.     We have collaborated with several iGEM teams, most notably Melbourne iGEM team. We worked with them extensively to consider an alternative approach to our bioremediation system using their star peptide instead of the micro-compartments that we'd previously considered.      Our engineers extensively modelled their system using stochastic simlation with the intention of investigating how reaction rates are improved using the star peptide. More information is available here:      Collaboration with the Melbourne iGEM team.     iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Describe an approach that your team used to address at least one of these questions. Evaluate your approach, including whether it allowed you to answer your question(s), how it influenced the team’s scientific project, and how it might be adapted for others to use (within and beyond iGEM).     Poster ready to go!
