Jose Gavaldá
Jose obtained his Bachelor of Biotechnology in the Polytechnic University of Valencia in 2014. He was elected “biofreak” by his classmates and he’s proud of it. Jose is a passionate about Synthetic Biology and he’s currently studying two Research Masters in “Biomolecular Sciences” and “Bioinformatics and Systems Biology” in the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
Some of Jose’s non-scientific interests are movies, basketball, cooking, a large list of extreme sports, martial arts and traveling.
