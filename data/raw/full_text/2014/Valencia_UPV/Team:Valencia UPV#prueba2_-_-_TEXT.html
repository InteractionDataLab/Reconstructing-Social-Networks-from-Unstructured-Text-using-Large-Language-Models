Make your stuff stick!
Ever wanted to pin something to the side of a text? Ever needed a subtle sticky element to quietly hang around as you scroll down?
jQuery.Pin is here to help! Pin any element to the top of a container. Easily disable it for smaller screen-sizes where there's no room for that kind of shenanigans.
Grab the plugin
Download jquery.pin.js from our Github repo . Then include jQuery and jQuery pin at the bottom of your HTML.
Pin an element:
$(".pinned").pin()
Pin within a container
$(".pinned").pin({       containerSelector: ".container" })
Disable on small screens
$(".pinned").pin({       minWidth: 940 })
Pin it!
Great for pinned navigations — or just about anything you want to stick.
