"With great powers comes great responsibility." – Benjamin Parker (Uncle Ben).
We know the importance of keeping genetically modified organisms under control. Ideally, modified genetic material should be unable to spread and organisms containing it should be easily distinguishable from wild type. Keeping this in mind, we created a biosafety module to be used in plants which will be available for future iGEM teams working with plants. Our biosafety module combines two biosafety strategies: identity preservation and male sterility.
Identity preservation enables an easy identification of the genetically modified organism. We expressed SlANT1 and SlJAF13 genes from tomato, which code for transcription factors that activate synthesis of anthocyanines [1], coloured compounds found in plants. The introduction of this element in the biosafety module generates differentially coloured plants (Figures 1 and 2). NRP-UEA-Norwich , and it is also used in their project “Green Canary”.

Male sterility makes impossible the dispersion of genetic material using pollen as the vehicle or by seeds result of self-pollination. In order to achieve this dispersion restriction, we integrated the active peptide of barnase, a RNAse from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, (Biobricks accession code BBa_I716211) under the regulation of the tapetum-specific promoter TA29 [1]. Both components are very well documented since TA29 has been used by a large number of researchers [2-6] and barnase has also been used under the regulation of different promoters [7,8]. We chose this strategy because it had been previously used in our laboratory with satisfactory results [9].
Our Biosafety module is our major present for future iGEM teams. It can be applied to a broad variety of new systems in future projects. We are certain that future iGEMers will realize how important biosafety is and they will incorporate our biosafety module in their systems.
