One of today’s greatest concerns regarding Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) is biosafety. While talking to people about our project we realized that fears about GMO are still present in our society. Therefore, we paid special attention to public perception and understanding when discussing our project approach as explained in the Policy and Practices overview.
As a result, the Biosafety module was developed. This module has two objectives, to preserve the identity of the genetically engineered plant allowing its unequivocal identification by changing its color; and avoid its uncontrolled spread inhibiting the pollen production by male-sterility. We implemented this module in collaboration with NRP-UEA-Norwich team and Results can be checked here.
Additionally, our team successfully completed the Safety form updating it when it was necessary.
