The modeling of this project encompasses two main approaches, each of them with the goal to predict the behavior of our system from different perspectives:
How much pheromone? Pheromone production modeling
Pheromones production rates are estimated using constraint-based models and Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). This is be useful to know about the amount of pheromone that can be produced by the synthetic plant during a certain period of time, once the system has ended its transitory levels of pheromone production.
Where it goes? Pheromone diffusion through the crop field and moth response
The analysis of the pheromones diffusion through the air in the field is interesting and useful to determine the following interrelated aspects. In order to achieve the mating disrupting among moths:  the amount of pheromone per unit of time that our synthetic plant would has to release, how many of them are required, and how they must be intercropped. With this aim in view, pheromone dispersion and moth behavior in presence of these additional continuously-emitting pheromone sources, are modeled.
