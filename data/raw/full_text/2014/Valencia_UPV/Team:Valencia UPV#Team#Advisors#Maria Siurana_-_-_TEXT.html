Maria Siurana
She's a Chemical Engineer, MSc. in Biotechnology and Mathematics (such diverse things!). She's currently doing her PhD on systems biology and hydrogen production in cyanobacteria at the Polytechnic University of Valencia.
She participated in the iGEM as student at 2010 and since there she has been involved as advisor. This year she's very happy to participate one more time, with new people and lots of new experiences!
