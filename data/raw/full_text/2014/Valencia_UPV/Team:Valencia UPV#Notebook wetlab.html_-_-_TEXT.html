Electrophoresis analysis.
We got the expected bands in all cases.
07/01/2014
AtrΔ11 amplification by PCR with primers that contain extra nucleotides to introduce them in the sequence.
We made a PCR amplification using the AtrΔ11 gene as a template and the oligos: R +F
Reagents needed:
32.5 μL of H2O miliQ
10 μL HF buffer
2 μL dNTPs
2.5 μL Reverse primer
2.5 μL Forward primer
1 μL template (AtrΔ11 gene)
0.5 μL phusion (polimerase)
PCR parameters: The annealing temperature was 60°C and the extension temperature was 65°C.
Electrophoresis performed to check the PCR product, which was expected to be around 1 kb.
pUPD ligation of EaDAcT, HarFar and AtrΔ11.
Reagents needed for the reaction of ligation:
1 μL pUPD
1 μL PCR product/gblock product
1.2 μL buffer 10x
1 μL BsmBI
1 μL T4 ligase
6.8 μL H2O miliQ
Vfinal= 12 μL
Termocycler parameters: The ligase temperature was 16°C and the BsmBI temperature was 37°C.
As a result, there are obtained three different pUPD plasmids containing the genes EaDAcT, HarFAR and AtrΔ11.
07/02/2014
E. coli transformation. This step is performed in a laminar air flow cabinet (LAF). We have used an electrocompetent E. coli strain (DH5α) and a sample from each product of ligation made in the previous step (three pUPD plasmids, each of them containing one of the three genes), so transformation is made three times.
Reagents needed:
E. coli aliquot
1.5 μL of ligation in pUPD (for each gene: EaDAcT, HarFAR, AtrΔ11)
Each mix is introduced in a electroporation vial and electroporated at 1500 V, then 300 μL of SOC are added to each vial. All of them were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour.
After incubation, culture in Petri plates (always in a LAF).
2 cell-culture dishes per transformation (with Ampicillin), one with 50 μL and the other with the remaining volume.
Petri plates are incubated at 37°C for 16 h.
07/03/2014
Transformed colonies selection. The white ones are recultured in liquid medium. One colony of each transformation is picked and cultured in 3.5 mL LB and 7 μL Amp. This step is repeated three times:
3x 1 colony of EaDAcT in pUPD + LB + Amp
3x 1 colony of HarFAR in pUPD + LB + Amp
3x 1 colony of AtrΔ11 in pUPD + LB + Amp
All tubes are incubated at 37°C overnight in agitation.

Perform electrophoresis to check if the size of the fragments from the digestions is correct.
Comments:
We picked blue colonies instead of white by mistake. We need to pick colonies again but this time make sure we pick white colonies.
For the repetition we must find another enzyme instead of BanII as we found out that it doesn't cut very well.
07/06/2014
We picked again 3 colonies for each construction, and we made sure that we picked the WHITE ones. We cultivated them in a "double check" (name invented by us)  liquid medium. Those tubes contain:
3.5 mL LB
7 μL Amp
7 μL X-Gal
3.5 μL IPTG (turns the tube blue if the colonies picked were blue)
07/07/2014
We made minipreps of yesterday's culture. Thanks to our "double check" medium we found which colonies were well picked. Finally we had minipreps of tubes HarFAR 1, 2, 3; EaDAcT 3 and AtrΔ11 2, 3.
Once we had the minipreps, we perform the digestions to check which were correct and send them to sequencing. This time we selected RsaI instead of BanII. The in silico digestions were as follows.

We run the electrophoresis gel to check if this time we have done it correctly.
Everything was OK. We sent AtrΔ11 (3), HarFAR (3) and EaDAcT (3) to sequence.
07/08/2014
Now, while we wait for sequencing results, we go on as they were going to be correct in order to save time.
The next step is to build a transciptional unit (TU) with our sequences. A transcriptional unit is a structure composed by promoter, coding sequence (CDS) and terminator in an α or Ω vector.
Reagents needed for ligation:
1 μL promoter 75 ng/μL
1 μL terminator 75 ng/μL
1 μL CDS 75 ng/μL
1 μL vector α
1.2 μL ligase buffer 10x
1 μL T4
1 μL BsaI
4.2 μL H20
Total: 12 μL
Take into account that if we want to make binary constructions later (merge 2 TU in a same vector), we need to clone each TU in a different α vector.

Mutation in AtrΔ11 -> We threw away the colonies and transformed cells. We picked again white colonies.
HarFAR -> Sequencing correct
EaDAcT -> Synonim mutation in 601 (A -> T). This is a gBlock!
We took vectors 2Ω1 (GB0487) and 2Ω2 (GB0488) parts from the GB colection.

Only P35s and T35s work for both. pPnos could also work.
Pick 3 colonies of P35s:HarFAR:THsp and PAtUbq:EaDAcT:THsp. Culture in liquid medium with Kan.
07/11/2014
We made minipreps of yesterday's liquid culture. Thanks to our "double check" medium we found which colonies were well picked. Finally we had minipreps of tubes AtrΔ11 3 and 6; 2Ω1; 2Ω2; constructions P35s:HarFAR:TatHSP 1, 2, 3 and PAtUbq:EaDAcT:TatHSP 1, 2, 3.
Additionally, we have cultured each of the colonies named above to store them.

We transformed the same TU in a E. coli competent strain (DH5α). Then, the transformants were cultured in LB media and Spm and stored at 37°C overnight.
Finally, in order to obtain the FAO1 gene, we want to extract the Candida tropicalis genome, so we have picked a colony of C. tropicalis. To check the extraction protocol, we used a yeast previously tested, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have cultured C. tropicalis in YPD media and S. cerevisiae in YPDA media at 28 °C (5 mL).

Candida genome extraction
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used as a control in order to see if we followed the protocol correctly. We aren't really sure if this protocol is going to work in Candida.
Cultures measured at 600 nm:
S. cerevisiae Abs = 1.07
C. tropicalis Abs = 0.39
S. cerevisiae is recultured with new media (1:2) because the previous media was saturated. 2.25 mL of YPD media were mixed with 2.25 mL of S. cerevisiae culture. The mix has to grow at 28 °C until the exponential phase is reached.
The absorbance was measured again:
S. cerevisiae Abs = 0.52
C. tropicalis Abs = 0.40
Buffers needed for the genome extraction were prepared freshly.The genome of both strains of yeast were extracted following the protocol:
Grow yeast in 2 or 5 mL YPD to exponential phase.
Collect cells in 1.5 mL eppendorf-cup (centrifugation 20 s, 6000 rpm).
Wash once with 1 mL sterile water.
Resuspend cells in 200 μL protoplast-buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1000 units Zymolyase/mL, 10 μL beta-mercaptoethanol/mL; prepare freshly!). Incubate at 37°C for 1-2 h and finally resuspend by turning the cups.
Add 200 μL of Lysis-Mix (0.2 M NaOH, 1% SDS) an mix carefully (Don't vortex!).
Incubate at 65 °C for 20 min and cool inmediately on ice.
Add 200 μL of 5 M KAc (pH 5.4) and mix carefully (Don't vortex!) and incubate 15 min on ice.
Centrifuge (13,000 rpm, 3 min) and transfer supernatant in a fresh cup.
Add 2 μL RNase A (10 mg/mL) and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.
Add 600 μL isopropanol and mix carefully (Don't vortex!). Incubate at room temperature for 5 min ad centrifuge (13,000 rpm, 30 s).
Remove the supernatant and wash with 70% ethanol (10 min at room temperature).
Centrifuge (13,000 rpm, 30 s) and remove the supernatant.
Dry DNA pellet in a speed-vacuum (not longer than 3 min!) and resuspend in 50 μL TE-buffer.
Store chromosomal DNA at 4 °C (Don't freeze!). Concentration and quality can be checked in an agarose gel (loading 1/10 of the volume).

The genomic quality of both organisms (C. tropicalis and S. cerevisiae) was checked in an agarose gel again.
We got the Candida genome band, however, the Saccharomyces genome band was not present.
Additionally, minipreps of the liquid culture made yesterday were made and also recultured in solid agar plate.

Agroinfiltration protocol consists of:
Centrifuge the cultures 15 min 3000 rpm and discard supernatant.
5 mL of agroinfiltration solution per culture. 100 mL of agroinfiltration solution were composed of 10 mL MES 100mM (pH 5.6), 1 mL MgCl2 1M and 100 μL acetosyringone solution 200 mM (19.62 mg, DMSO 500 μL; prepare freshly). Mix it with the vortex. If the culture is still turbid, add a bit more of agroinfiltration sollution. Put it in the (rodillos) for two hours.
Measure the OD. The optimum OD for agroinfiltration is 0.2. If it is too high adjust the concentration with more agroinfiltration solution.
Mix the cultures, keeping all of them in the same proportions.
Proceed to agroinfiltration.

PHEROMONE ANALYSIS
PONER ENLACE DE LA WIKI
To begin with samples were obtained from the agroinfiltrated plants after 5 days. We collected 9 samples:
2 leaves from P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos
2 leaves from TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos
2 leaves from TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos
1 leaf from a wild type plant
Each sample was stored in a vial and kept in liquid nitrogen. Leaves were mashed using a mortar and liquid nitrogen until powder from each leaf is obtained and stored in a vial .Samples must be always kept in liquid nitrogen or in a -80°C freezer . Afterwards the leaf powder was weighted and introduced in a 10 mL screwcap headspace vial.
94,6 mg of P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf (replica 1)
97,0 mg of TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf (replica 2)
118,7 mg of TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf (replica 1)
100,0 mg of wild type leaf
Then  150 μL of EDTA 500mM and 1 mL of a saturated solution of CaCl2 (5,7M) were added to each vial.
EDTA 500mM preparation:
Stock of solid EDTA Di-Sodium 372,24 Mw and a final solution of 50 mL, 500mM. 372,24*0,5*0,05=9,306 g in 50 mL.
After the addition of EDTA and CaCl2 the samples were sonicated dutring 5 minutes to disgregate the tissue and release the volatile compounds. Afterwards the samples were analysed by GC-MC following this procedure.

Analysis was performed overnight.

First results of the analysis were obtained. The analysis proved that our plant was successfuly producing the desired pheromones in high concentration. As expected z-11-hexadecen-1-ol and z-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate were being produced and also unexpectedly the z-11-hexadecenal.
As shown in the figure, the leaf agroinfiltrated with TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos (represented in black) shows a successful production of (Z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol compared with the negative control that only has P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos (represented in blue) and shows no expression.
In this figure, expression of (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol and (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate is proved. The expression in the leaf infiltrated with TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos is represented in black, and the negative control with P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos is represented in blue.
In this figure, an unexprected peak present in the leaf infiltrated with TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos (black) can be observed. Comparing its spectrum with the one provided from the database seems to be (z)-11-hexadecenal, a desired pheromone,  which is being produced by the plant itself using an endogenous alcohol oxidase. Nevertheless as it is produced with a low yield, the FAO1 of C. tropicalis search is still in progress.
The rest of the samples were prepared for the GC-MS analysis.
The samples were weighted, introduced in the vial and added with EDTA and CaCl2.
94,0 mg of P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf (replica 2)
102,4 mg of TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf (replica 1)
92,0 mg of TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos leaf(replica 2)
Results of the replicae analysis are shown below:
In this replica, the sample with the TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos construction shows a huge production of (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol.
In this replica, the sample with the TU AtrΔ11+TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos shows a higher abundance of (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol and z-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate.
In order to verify that the analysed compounds are the desired pheromones, we acquired standards for (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol and (z)-11-hexadecen-1-ol acetate and (z)-11-hexadecenal, and indeed, the analysed compunds were the right ones.

We had problems to amplify the FAO1 gene, so in order to obtain it we performed a colony PCR. Using this method, it is possible to amplify a fragment directly from a colony rather than a DNA sample.
We made two different PCRs, one of them as a positive control and the other one to amplify our disered DNA fragment.
Colony PCR protocol (Taq Polimerase):
1 colony (C. tropicalis)
1.5 μL dNTPs
1 μL Forward Primer
1 μL Reverse Primer
1 μL Taq Polimerase
5 μL Buffer 10X
39.5 μL H2O miliQ
Primers used as a control: HSR1 + 480 and RTRv + 1149.

Starting from an agar plate containing a Candida genomic library, we add 1 mL of LB medium and we mix it. Then, the mix was transferred into a tube. We stored part of the culture in glycerine and another part (200 μL) was mixed with 5 mL of LB media and Amp (2:1000).
The tube containing the genomic library was grown at 28°C for 1 hour. Then, we made minipreps.
The electrophoresis gel shows that the colony PCR failed, even the control did not work. Additionally, we test the BbsI restriction enzyme and we found that it does not cut well.

We were trying to obtain the FAO1 gene. We did a yeast colony PCR. Using an sterile tip, we picked one C. tropicalis colony and we introduced them into a vial containing 30 μL SDS 0.2 %. The vial was vortexed 15 seconds and then heated 4 minutes at 90°C. Next, it was centrifuged during 1 minute ans the supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 μL vial. That was our PCR template.
We performed a control PCR employing control primers (HSRI Rtrv + 1149 and HSRI BamHI + 480)and the another PCR using FAO1 primers as previously done (iGEMJul09 and iGEMJul10).

We did not close the PCR tube properly so we found our PCR product evaporated (named as FAO in the gel). The other PCR product (the control) was loaded and as it is shown in the gel electrophoresis, it didn't work.
08/22/2014
We did again a yeast genomic extraction (C. tropicalis), but this time we changed the protocol:
Pick 8 colonies of C. tropicalis growth in YPD media and resuspend them with 100 μL of solution (200 mM LiOAc and SDS 1%).
Incubate 15 min at 70°C.
Add 300 μL of ethanol 96%. Then, vortex the solution.
Centrifuge 3 min at 15000 xg.
Discard the superatant and resuspend the pellet (precipitated DNA) with 100 μL TE.
Centrifuge 1 min at 15000 xg.
Recover 1 μL of supernatant.
Using this genomic DNA as a template, we run a PCR (using Taq polimerase) with our primers and another one as a control.

We transformed the piece (P35S:P19:T35S) into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (C58) and we cultured it in solid media with Kan (1:1000) and Rif (1:1000) at 28°C during 2 days.
08/17/2014
Agrobacterium containing the piece has not growm well, so we transformed the piece again and we cultured it in an agar plate following the same protocol as previously. In the mean time, we made agar plates.
We made ligations of the three enzymes that form the (Z)11-16:OAc (Z11-hexadecenyl acetate) pheromone but this time each TU will contain the trichome promoter.
Note: For further information about the PCPS2 promoter, please check the trichome promoter section.

08/19/2014
Agrobacterium has not grown in agarose plates, so we made a transformation again.
E. coli colonies containing the TUs were recultured in liquid media:
PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S in 2α1
PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S in 2α2
PCPS2:EaDAcT:T35S in 2α2

Digestions were correct, but the PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S digestion 1 with HindIII resulted in more bands than expected, so we discarded that miniprep product and we used the other one.
We adjusted checked products to 75 ng/μL in order to use them in ligations.
We ligated the TUs containing the trichome promoter in Ω vectors as follows:
Ligation 1 (Vt = 10 μL):
1 μL PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S
1 μL PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S
1 μL 2Ω1
1 μL BsmBI
1 μL T4 ligase
1 μL Buffer ligase

Ligation 2 (Vt = 10 μL):
1 μL SF (Stuffer fragment)
1 μL PCPS2:EaDAcT:T35S
1 μL 2Ω2
1 μL BsmBI
1 μL T4 ligase
1 μL Buffer ligase
4 μL H2O miliQ
Reaction conditions: 25 cycles x (37°C 2 min, 16°C 5 min).
Then, we recultured E. coli in solid media.
TUs ligated previously were transformed in E. coli following the same protocol as it is usually used.
Finally, we obtained the control (Z)11-16Hexadecenl Acetate that will be used to check the peack in the GC-MS analysis.
08/21/2014
Agrobacterium cells containing P35S:P19:TNos did not grow, so we ask Marta for the glycerinated Agrobacterium culture.
The vector containing the TU was pGreen and we cultured them with Tetracycline, Rifampicin and Kanamycin.
We have confirmed our peak because the control sample has the same retention time and distribution pattern.
Additionally, we have recultured in liquid media TUs ligated yesterday.
08/22/2014

T35S:P19:GFP:TNos + P35S:AtrΔ11:T35S_P35S:HarFAR:T35S_P35S:EaDAcT:T35S
We picked colonies which were transformed yesterday and we recultured them in liquid media with Spm, IPTG and X-Gal.
Finally, we have trasplanted N. benthamiana into new flowerpots to have plants ready to infiltrate in the future.
08/26/2014
We made minipreps of yesterday's culture, but only for the TU PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S in 2Ω1 since the other tubes were blue colored.

We picked PCPS2 in pUPD colonies and recultured them in liquid media in order to preservate them with glycerol.
08/29/2014
We made a ligation as follows:
PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S_SF_PCPS2:EaDAcT:T35S in 2α1 (Total Volume = 10 μL)

Additionally, we transformed into Agrobacterium:
PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S in 2Ω1
SF_PCPS2:EaDAcT:T35S in 2Ω2
On the other hand, we observed the leaves agroinfiltred this week and we took pictures showing that the trichome promoter works.
08/30/2014
We picked colonies:
PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S:SF_P35S:EaDAcT:T35S in 2α1

We stored in glycerol at -80°C cultures grown yesterday:
Add 300 μL glycerol (50%) and 700 μL of liquid culture.
Mix it well using vortex.
Store at -80°C.
We transformed into E. coli ligation made yesterday and we cultured cells in agar plates.
09/03/2014
Ligation was repeated since we did not found any white colony in the agar plates. Ligation Conditions were the same as we did previously. We transformed it in E. coli and we recultured the cells in agar plates. We followed the same protocol again.
We made minipreps of yesterday's Agrobacterium colonies:
PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S in 2Ω1

All digestions were correct except digestions from one miniprep (SF_PCPS2:EaDAcT:T35S). We had two replicates and only one of them was incorrect, so we could refresh the cultures with liquid media in order to follow the agroinfiltration protocol.
09/04/2014
Following the previously explained agroinfiltration protocol, we agroinfiltrated N. benthamiana with:
Agrobacterium control culture P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos
TU AtrΔ11 + TU HarFAR and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos
TU AtrΔ11 + TU HarFAR and TU EaDAcT and P35s:GFP:P19:Tnos
We picked colonies of colonies transformated yesterday with TU AtrΔ11 + TU HarFar + TU EaDAcT.
We picked colonies to store them in glycerol:
PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S in 2mega1
SF_PCPS2:EaDAcT:T35S in 2Ω2
Result analysis:
Samples were checked by GC-MS and we found low pheromone signal. I may be due to agroinfiltered leaves showed necrosis. We have to repeat the experiment to confirm that our construction is not well tolerated by plants.
Additionally, we found that the alcohol precursor did not appear in the chromatogram. Nevertheless, the acetate product was present in higher quantities than the previous time, suggesting that higher yields can be obtained when the three  gens are placed in the same construction.
09/05/2014
Colonies picked yesterday were not correct since resulting cultures were blue. We repeated the ligation, but this time we added 1 μL of BsaI enzyme after the inactivation step. It was incubated at 37°C during 1 hour. Then we transformed the ligation and cultured it in agar plates.

Agroinfiltered samples were collected following the usual procedure:
PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S coinfiltered with P35S:P19:GFP:TNos
PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S coinfiltered with P35S:P19:GFP:TNos and PCPS2:EaDAcT
P35S:P19:GFP:TNos
They were grinded up with liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80°C.
To store our constructions in glycerol, we picked some colonies and cultured them in liquid media:
PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S_SF_PCPS2:EaDAcT:T35S in 2α1
We are going to do the miniprep again to be sure that we are storing it correctly.
We picked colonies of A. tumefaciens containing the pheromone pathway with trichome promoter (PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S_SF_P35S:EaDAcT:T35S).
09/11/2014
We have recultured A. tumefaciens containing:
P35S:P19:GFP:TNos
We picked colonies once again to store the cultures in glycerol, since we did a mistake and minipreps were thrown away:
PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S_SF_PCPS2:EaDAcT:T35S in 2α1
09/12/2014
We prepared samples to inject them in GC-MS following the same protocol as previously carried out, that is to say, grinding samples with liquid nitrogen, adding saturated CaCl2 and EDTA and sonicating.
We have digested A. tumefaciens minipreps (PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S_SF_P35S:EaDAcT:T35S in 2α1)
We made minipreps of yesterday's E. coli culture:

Digestions in silico were the same as previouly done.
We did not obtined the expected bands in case of the pathway regulated by the PCPS2 promoter.
We repeated again the ligation in 2α1 employing the same conditions. Then, we inactivated the enzyme by incubation at 80°C uring 30 min. After that, we added BsaI in order to prevent the growth of blue colonies in the agar plates.
In parallel, we used the miniprep to transform the construction into E. coli.
We recultured A. tumefaciens cutures to agroinfiltrate.
09/18/2014
Following the protocol we agroinfiltrated the following mixtures:
P35S:P19:GFP:TNos (control)
PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S_SF_PCPS2:EaDAcT:T35S with PCPS2:P19:GFP:TNos

PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S_SF_PCPS2:EaDAcT:T35S with P35S:P19:GFP:TNos
Samples were freezed with liquid nitrogen and grinded. Then, there were stored at -80°C. Some of the samples were analyzed by CEQA.
We picked A. tumefaciens colonies containing the TU to agroinfilter.
09/25/2014
Following the same protocol as usually, we agroinfiltered N. benthamiana leaves.
Collected samples of previos experiments were analysed GC-MS, following the same procedure as usually:

PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S_SF_PCPS2:EaDAcT:T35S with P35S:P19:TNos
Additionally, we recultured the same cultures and grown them at 28°C.
We repeated A. digestions because we did not make streakes:
PCPS2:AtrΔ11:T35S_PCPS2:HarFAR:T35S
PCPS2:EaDAcT:T35S

We still do not get PCR product.
08/12/2014
We forgot to adjust the TA29:Barnase:Tnos from GB 1.0 to 5 ng/μL. Maybe that's why PCRs don't work. We repeated again with the appropiate temperatures (60°C for TA29 and 63°C for barnase), but it still doesn't work!
08/18/2014
We transformed in E. coli the iGEM Barnase part (BBa_1716211), placed in Plate 3, 11o.

Cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspended in ten folds the culture volume with a phosphate buffered saline (58 mM Na2HPO4, 17 mM NaH2PO4, 68 mM NaCl), as performed by Scholz et al., 2000. Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 were purchased from Panreac. NaCl was purchased from Fisher Bioreagents.
A GloMax-Multi Detection System form Promega fluorometer configured with the Blue optical kit (&Lamda;ex=490 nm, &Lamda;em=510-575 nm) was used to measure fluorescence. For measuring fluorescence 250 Î¼l of each sample were placed in a black 96-well plate. Each sample was measured three times and an average was displayed on the screen.
A Biowave CO 8000 from Biochrom spectophotometer was used to measure absorbance at 600 nm. For measuring absorbance 700 Î¼l were placed in a cubet and measured one by one in the spectrophotometer.
