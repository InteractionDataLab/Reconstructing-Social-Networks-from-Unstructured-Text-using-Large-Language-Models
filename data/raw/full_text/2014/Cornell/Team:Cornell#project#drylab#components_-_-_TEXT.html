List of Components
Waterproof Pelican Case (2’x3’)
The box is a weather-resistant casing for our filter system components.
Pentek Microguard Filtration System
Micron Rating: 0.15 Absolute Filtration
Pressure Range: 30-125 psi
Temperature Range: 40-125 F
Flow Rate: 1 GPM
Capacity: 200-600 gallons
Inlet/Outlet: 1/2"
Collecting Drum (12”x12”)
The collecting drum is used to collect industrial wastewater from factory outlets.
DC Water Circulation Pump
Voltage: 12 V, Current: 0.8 A
A DC water circulation pump used to maintain constant flow through the box. The pump is connected to and is controlled by the Arduino.
Hollow Fiber Reactor
Model #: 2011
Fiber Material: high flux polysulfone
Pore Size: MWCO 20kd @ 50%
20 mL capacity of ECS
The hollow fiber reactor allows heavy metal ions to flow transversely through a membrane into a compartment with engineered cells, which sequester them from the water.
Leoch Lead Acid Battery (LPG 12-100)
Model #: LPG12-100
Power Rating: 100 Ah/1200 Whr
Voltage: 12 V
Dimensions: 13” x 6.8” x 8.4”
The battery is connected to the Arduino and the pump.
Instaspark 15 W Mono-Crystalline Solar Panel
15 W mono-crystalline solar panel
Model #: SPCC-15W
The solar panel is used to recharge the battery.
Foam and acrylic for keeping components fixed within Pelican Case
This padding material will hold items like the battery and filters in place and elevate them to an easily accessible area for maintenance. Grooves have been carved in the material to enable for easy monitoring of piping.
