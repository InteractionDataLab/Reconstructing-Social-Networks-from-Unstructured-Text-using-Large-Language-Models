Outreach
Our goal is to make synthetic biology accessible to everyone. We worked with people of all ages and education levels, from children to high school biology teachers, to enhance their understanding of biology, specifically synthetic biology. Additionally, we presented our project research to various groups including other scientists, college students, and high school students. We also made an effort to work directly with both children and adults in our community, hoping to spur interest in younger minds as well as to garner a greater understanding of genetic engineering by the community as a whole.
Research Presentations
Through educational presentations to Cornell Institute for Biology Teachers (CIBT), Summer Institute for the Life Sciences (SILS) and Pre-freshman Summer Program (PSP), we hoped to educate students, faculty and staff about Synthetic Biology and the opportunities for furthering education in biology.
Community Outreach
Over the summer, we ran community outreach programs at the Ithaca Sciencenter and Tompkins Country Public Library. We hope to raise awareness of Synthetic biology to spark interest where opportunities are not as abundant.
Student Education
In order to create interest by up and coming students at the high school and college level in biology, we taught several programs including Cornell Adult University (CAU) Youth Program, Splash! at Cornell and ENGRD 1050. Our goal was to educate students about Synthetic Biology so they are aware of the opportunities available to them as they decide on their future careers.
