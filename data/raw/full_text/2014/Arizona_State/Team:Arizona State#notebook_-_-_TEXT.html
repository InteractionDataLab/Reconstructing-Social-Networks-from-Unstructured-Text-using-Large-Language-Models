Project Phases
 
June: Project planning and set up
July-October: Synthesis of Fatty acid producing plasmids, such as the TesA plasmid
September - October: Preparation and testing of the ethanol producing parts
October: Preparation and testing of the wax esterase plasmid
 
 
Procedures
Gel making/running: Gels were all 1% agarose gels using safe white dye. Al were ran for 1 hr. at 95 V.
Enyzme digestions/ Ligations: Our team had a bit of a learning curve with digestions and ligations. We tried several different methods to ensure they would work, but the most common was the procedure found in the Haynes Lab Procedures
 
Resting Cell Assay
To test the productivity of different plasmids, resting cell assays were run. All assays were run in a shaker incubator at 32 degrees C and 200 RPM. A phosphate buffered solution was used to suspend the growth of the cultures.
 
Quantification
A GC with a DB5 column was used to quantify data from all assays. For testing ethanol production, the method used had an initial temp. of 60 degrees C, and ramped by 10 degrees C until it reached 250 degrees C, which was then held for 3 minutes.
