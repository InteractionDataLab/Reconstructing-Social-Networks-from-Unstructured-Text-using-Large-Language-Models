CRISPR Construction
 
 
 
Fig.1
 
We synthesised a new CIRSPR system based on  a CRISPR designed by Standford-Brown 2013 ( BBa_K1218011 ). Here we  analyzed its sequence and then removed its Cas9 protein with Cas9’s promoter  because we want our Cas9’s expression can be inducible. So then we synthesized  a new  Cas9 structure which contains an  inducible promoter, pRha ( BBa_K914003 ).  This promoter can be induced by rhamnose and silenced by glucose, both sugar  can be find in nature. Next, we put our inducible Cas9 back to the CRISPR  system, and because tracrRNA and crRNA have no function without Cas9 protein,  this CRISPR is now under our control.
  Recombinant Phagemid Construction
 
 
 
After constructing our CRISPR system, we  ligated it with a red fluorescent reporter gene ( BBa_I13521 ), so once our  system is spread, all bacterium get this system will become red. Finally, we  put whole system into phagemid pBluescript II SK(-), and get the recombinant  phagemid for M13 infection.
