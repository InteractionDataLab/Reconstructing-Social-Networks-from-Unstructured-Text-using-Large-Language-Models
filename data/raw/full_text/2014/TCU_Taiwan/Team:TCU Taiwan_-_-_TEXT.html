 Project Overview
This year, TCU_Taiwan provide a new tool dealing with bacterial antibiotic resistance - the Trogene Horse. Our Trogene Horse can produce one-generation phage carrying CRISPR system with particular signal.
Trogene Horse is a new concept combining phage therapy with CRISPR, and this combination can solve both safety concern(phage therapy) and efficiency problem(CRISPR). We believe our project can deal with bacterial resistance problem on agriculture, and hope it can access on medicine one day.
