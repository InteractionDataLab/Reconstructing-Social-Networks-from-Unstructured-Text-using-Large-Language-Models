Bronze
Form a team.
Complete judging form.
Constructed attractive Wiki page.
Present a poster and a talk were readied for Giant Jamboree.
Several Biobricks were built, improved and documented by our team.
- Construct new BioBricks
a. 19 gRNAs
b. 1 phagemid pBluescript
c. 1 pRha induced CRISPR
 
 
Silver
Experimentally validate Biobricks of our team design and  construct were as expected.
- Construct  new system designs
a. CRISPR  Construction (Figure.1)
b. Recombinant  Phagemid Construction (Figure.2)
We have documented and  characterized of our parts in the ”Main Page” section and registry entry.
-Tests the BioBrick
a. BBa_K1473005
b. BBa_K1473002
c. BBa_K1473003
d. BBa_K1473004
Submit our new parts to iGEM Parts registry.
Because we use phages in our projct, it could cause some safety problems if phages remain in environment. So we decided to use helper phage and phagemid for phage display, this will solve these problems because those phages cannot have next generation.
 
Gold
We improve the function of BBa_K1218011  from 2013 Stanford-Brown .
Cooperation with NCTU-Formosa Team on  modeling. We provide the data to NCTU-Formosa Team then they make the model for  us.
In  our project, we still need antibiotics to reduce the amount of bacteria. So we  come up with an idea : use 16S rRNA as CIRSPR's target to avoid co-effect of  antibiotic use. We have put it in our future work.
 
Human Practice
Held an iGEM speech at National Hualien  Girl’s Senior High School,  the content includes  introduction of  synthetic biology, our project. We have also designed a game about basic of our gRNA.
Join the 2014 iGEM Conference in National Chiao Tung University in summer vacation, we have social contacts with several iGEM teams from China and  Taiwan
Share Project and Promote Synthetic Biology in Tzu Chi University
Question Survey about synthetic biology.
Promotion of iGEM and Synthetic Biology to  populace.
Face Page : Tzu Chi University iGEM
Skype with NCTU-Formosa and NYMU-Taipei
 
Computer Modeling
Find the best release amount of phage after helper  phage infecting.
To know under which condition can get the best infection  rate of our phagemid-carrying phage.
