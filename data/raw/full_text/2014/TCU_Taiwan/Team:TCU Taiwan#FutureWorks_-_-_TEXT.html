In the future, we plan to make our Trogene  Horse become a substitute to antibiotics. Because antibiotic uses are forbidden  in some industry (ex. animal husbandry), there is no sense silencing resistance  gene in these parts.
 
 
We believe 16S rRNA gene can be the new target of our Trogene Horse. The 16S rRNA gene is a housekeeping gene, it has some special characters we are interested:
1. Its presence in almost all microbe, and its sequence remains high conservation.
2. The function of the  16S rRNA gene over time has not  changed (help constructing ribosome).
 
 
Because  16S rRNA is necessary for ribosome and it exists  among microbes, knock-out of its gene will  block gene expression and inhibit growth of target bacteria. This  shall avoid co-effect of antibiotic use and remains high efficiency because we  use phages as vector.
