TCU-Taiwan is a team founded in 2009 and was instructed by Professor Ingrid Y.C. Liu, Professor Peng Yeong Woon and Professor Hsin-Yi Yu. Now it is taken over by Professor Ingrid Y.-C. Liu, Professor Peng Yeong Woon and Professor Yung-Hao Ching. Our team have students from department of medical informatics and department of molecular biology and human genetics of Tzu Chi University.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Who are we?  
We are TCU-Taiwn team !
We are a small team with only 7 people, so each of us has to carry multi-work. It is not easy to have so much work while our class is heavy, too. And we did had a hard time that everyone wanted to give up. But we took it over successfully by helping each other as well as accomplishing our own job. As time goes by, TCU_Taiwan has grown from a team to a big family. Together, we all looking forward to enjoy the iGEM competition and share more details about our “Trogene Horse” with all iGEMers.

Lin,Yi-Ting     Eating
 
Hello! I am Yi-Ting, a junior student majoring in Molecular Biology and Human Genetics at Tzu Chi University. I am really delighting to get an opportunity joining in iGEM. I am the leader of 2014 TCU-Taiwan. In our team, I worked with wet experiment and 2014 Synthetic Biology information meeting of local senior high school and Tzu Chi University as a chief convener. My hobbies are playing basketball, riding bike, running, listening to classical music, journey and eating. My dream is to be a traveler, eat and play all around the world! I am full of enthusiasm in molecular biology and hope to gain more knowledge of molecular biology during the competition. Let’s do our best and enjoy the iGEM! I think it as the most special experience to me.
Shan, Zhe     Ted
 
I am Zhe Shan , you can also call me Ted. I am majoring in molecular biology and human genetics now. I come from China and I play as second leader in TCU_Taiwan. I am in charge of our project’s system design, and I also join some part of our wet experiment.I enjoy working with my teammates together. In addition to learning synthetic biology, iGEM has let me understand the idea of teamship and responsibility.
I love science, I enjoy working in the lab because it makes me feel very cool. And I consider Taiwan, this beautiful island, as my second hometown, its special culture impressed me a lot. When I am free, I like swimming, playing computer games, listening rock and roll (ROCK!!!) and eating. My dream is make some great contribution on molecular biology and get famous for that.
Hsieh,Siang-En     Sharon
 
Sharon is a sentimental student who always got so many interesting ideas in his brain. With these ideas, he often see things from a different point of view and this can sometimes get an unexpected result .He enjoys thinking, sharing his ideas with other people, reading books and arts. Thanks to his unlimited imagination, we never get lack of ideas during our project design. Besides, he is a professional photographer in our team.
Chen,Shih-Jie     Mr.Bo
 
Hey guys! I am happy to join this party with you. I am BoBo Chen from TzuChi University, Hualien. I am a junior student and I am working in microbiology genetic lab now. And I am in charge of wet experiment of TCU_Taiwan. I like playing basketball since I was a child, and when I grew up genetics and physiology of bacteria became my second interest. I hope I can make the best of what I learned and improve it during this competition.
Chen,Yu-Ting     Regina
 
Hello everyone! I am Yu-Ting Chen. I come from Taiwan and I am a junior student of TzuChi University, Hualien. I am working on wet experiment in TCU_Taiwan and I see my work as pleasure! In other time, I like surfing the Facebook, hang out with my friends and reading scientific articles. I want to make more friends, so please contact with me if we have same hobbies!
Lien,Pei-Yi     Denise
 
Hello~ My name is Denise. I come from Taiwan. And I study in Tzu Chi University , my major is Molecular Biology and Human Genetics. I am in experimental group in TCU_Taiwan and I also do some administrative matters.
I want to join the iGEM contest, because I want to make many new friends from different countries, and build up my global vision. I’m so exciting to participate iGEM in MIT. Besides, I like making friends, welcome to add my facebook : bty31025@yahoo.com.tw
The iGEM 2014 Giant Jamboree! I am coming!!
Hao,Hsu     House
 
Nice to meet you, every iGEMers! My name is House, the oldest member in TCU_Taiwan.
My major is Medical Informatics. Do you know what is Medical Informatics? If not, you can consider my major as “computer science” plus “medicine”.However, iGEM is Synthetic Biology competition, then… Why am I here? What can I do? Actually, what I am doing is coding our wiki page to become the best one!And the most important is to study all about Synthetic Biology from wetlab to drylab. We still got a lot of things to learn, but just enjoying this short fantasy now.
See you in MIT. =)
