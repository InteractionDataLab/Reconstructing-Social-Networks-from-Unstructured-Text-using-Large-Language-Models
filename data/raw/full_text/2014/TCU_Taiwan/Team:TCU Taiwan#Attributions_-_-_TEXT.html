We would like to thank all the people who came to our progress presentations and gave useful feedback.
 
Instructors support
 
Lin,Guang-Huey
Professor Lin teaches knowledge about microbiology for TCU iGEM team each year, and she also guides our experimental design. Besides, she provides her lab for us to working on our experiment.
 
Lin,Nien-Tsung
Prof. Lin, a gracious teacher, is the guiders of our experiment on M13 phage display. She provides us a lot knowledge about M13 phage and DNA cloning.
 
 
 
Ching,Yung-Hao
Prof. Ching is one of the leader teachers of our team. She is a kind teacher who always encourages us, and she also gives us much advice and direction on safety concerns.
 
Woon,Peng-Yeong
Prof. Woon is one of the leader teachers for this year. He helps us the basic concept of iGEM and reminds us many iGEM rules or requests we nearly missed. He is a lively professor.
