Phagemid pBluescript is a  special plasmid, it functions as a normal plasmid when transformed into  bacteria. But when helper phage M13KO7 infect the bacteria, it will produce  phagemid-carrying phages. 
pBluescript contains a f1 ori while M13KO7  helper phage’s f1 ori has been mutated. So after the infection of M13KO7,  its genome can produce protein and replicate but these proteins will package  pBluescript as "genome". As a result, the pahemid-carrying phaes will only contain pBluescript, they cannot make next generation.

Here we combined a CRISPR system( BBa_K1218011 ) with an inducible promoter( BBa_K914003 ). The CRISPR system contains a tracrRNA , a Cas9 protein and a minimal      CRISPR array, it functions to knockout target gene. We give this system an inducible promoter so we can decided when to switch it on or off.

Fig.3
We put a sacI restriction  cutting site downstream to gRNA (not shown in sequence information) and ligated  it back to pSB1C3 with correct prefix and surffix. Then we cut this recombinant  plasmid with sacI and run gel  electrophoresis for checking. As we can see in this image, because pSB1C3 only  contains 1 sacI cutting site itself,  so it would not be cut into 2 parts when no gRNA is ligated inside. But if  there is, then sacI will cut this  recombinant plasmid into 2 parts, whose lengths are 939 bp and 1159 bp.  Obviously, we have successfully synthesized this gRNA.
