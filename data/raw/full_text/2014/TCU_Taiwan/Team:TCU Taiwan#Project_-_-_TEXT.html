Abstract
 
 
To access this, we use a special phagemid for phage display. The phagemid contains a additional phage replication origin.  When helper phage (a phage whose own ori is knock-out) infection take place,  phagemid can be packaged as genome for progeny. Since we put an antibiotic resistance gene targeting CRISPR system on our phagemid, this phage display can  spread our CRISPR among bacterium nearby and remove their resistance  efficiently.
Trogene Horse is a new concept combining  phage therapy with CRISPR, and this combination can solve both safety  concern(phage therapy) and efficiency problem(CRISPR). We believe our project  can deal with bacterial resistance problem on agriculture, and hope it can  access on medicine one day.
Protagonist
Trogene horse is a lovely wooden horse, but he carries a super  weapon inside, and this weapon can help greek soldiers defeat Troy city.
Super Cast
 
Antibiotics：
A  group of greek soldiers who is eager to conquest troy city.
