M13 Phage Mechanism
 
In our project, the CRISPR system is been transported by phage. So  how can phage recognized which DNA it should package and spread? That is  accessed by phagemid and helper phage.
 
Fig.1
 
Take M13KO7 helper phage and phagemid pBluescript II SK(-) as  example, as we use them in our experiment. M13KO7 helper phage has complete  coat proteins and a complete genome just like normal M13 phage. But its f1 ori  has been inserted by a p15A ori and a kanamycin resistance gene. While in  pBluescript, its structure is like a normal plasmid but carries two replication  origin: a high efficient PUC ori for itself, and an additional normal f1 ori.
In other phagemid and helper phage pairs, situations are same:  helper phage’s replication origin is mutated while phagemid contains an  additional replication origin for this helper phage.
 
Fig.2
 
When a normal M13 phage infect E.coli with F plasmid(strain JM101 in our experiment), it will use F pilus to put its  genome into cytosol. Then this single strand genome will use host’s polymerase to make itself a  double strand structure and stay in cytosol like a plasmid.
M13 genome contains major 9 genes, we call each gene’s product as gp1, gp2, etc. When it wants to produce progeny phage, gp2 will recognize f1 ori and make a single  strand break on genome. Then gp5 will form dimer structure and start to package  this single strand DNA from package signal on f1 ori, this will help stabilize  single strand genome in cytosol. After that, progeny phage will be released from host cell and be  coated by gp3, gp6, gp7, gp8, gp9.
 
When it comes to M13KO7 helper phage, it  still can successfully infect E.coli with F plasmid and make its genome stable in cytosol by  host’s polymerase. But because its f1 ori has been  mutated, so gp2  cannot make a nick on M13KO7's genome. This means,  helper phage cannot produce progeny phage itself.
However, if this E.coli has  been transformed with a pBluescript II SK(-), gp2 will recognize intergenic region and make a  nick on this plasmid. And then gp5  dimers will package the single strand of pBluescript because they believe this  is their “genome”! In this situation, host cell will release phages but these  phages do not contains their genome, they will carry phagemid instead. So they  will not be able to make next generation after infection, so we call them “phagemid-carrying  phage”.
