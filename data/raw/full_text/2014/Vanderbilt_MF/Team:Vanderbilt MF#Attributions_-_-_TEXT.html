Attributions
We would like to thank the Vanderbilt University School of Engineering for their help in initiating Vanderbilt iGEM. Without their financial support this organization would not have been able to take root at Vanderbilt.
Additionally, the resources of the VIIBRE personal, SyBBURE, and the McCarra lab have been invaluable throughout our project and we hope to utilize their support as iGEM continues to grow at Vanderbilt University.
We would also like to give thanks to the authors of the papers listed below, without their prior research our ideas and methods may never have come to fruition. We thank them for their contributions to microfluidics and hope to continue their work into the future.
