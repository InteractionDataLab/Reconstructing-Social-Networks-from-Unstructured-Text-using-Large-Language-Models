Computer Science - Web Applications  
  			B.Sc. Microbiology and Immunology</P><SPAN>Amit graduated from McGill University with a major in Microbiology and Immunology, however, his career saw him on a completely different path.  After running his own business for 13 years in sales, marketing and information technology, he decided to do a second bachelor's degree, but in Computer Science, a subject he had grown fond of during his business venture.  He is currently studying Computer Science with a focus on Web Applications at Concordia University and works full-time at Radialpoint Inc. as an automation developer.  Sort of a workaholic, he enjoys the pressure full time studies combined with full time employment brings on and is always looking to combine his love of microbiology with his love of computers.</SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="biorow2"><SPAN class="textbox2"><H3>David Oram</H3><P>B.Sc. Biology, iBBA, SCS</P><SPAN>Hey, I’m David Oram from Newfoundland, Canada and am entering the last year of a B.Sc Biology at Concordia University. Before joining Concordia, I obtained an iBBA from Memorial University and gained my Canadian Securities Course (CSC) certification while working in investment banking. Since returning to the sciences I am become enthralled with synthetic astrobiology and the promise of exponential technologies.  I am honoured to be apart of the only iGEM team from Quebec and am looking forward to representing Concordia on the International stage!</SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="biorow1"><SPAN class="textbox1"><H3>Dilan B Jaunky</H3><P>B.Sc. Cell and Molecular Biology</P><SPAN>&quot;The world is my Oyster&quot;. Cleverly written, this proverb has been a great mental moto to stimulate my desire to understand the world around me. My quest for a better awareness of myself seems to be tightly entwined with the Science of the living and Synthetic biology has granted me the opportunity to build upon this bond.</SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="biorow2"><SPAN class="textbox2"><H3>Elena Boueiri</H3><P>B.Sc. Cell and Molecular Biology</P><SPAN>I am Elena Boueiri, an undergraduate student at Concordia University. I am currently undertaking my last year of studies in the Cell and Molecular Biology program. This year, I am part of the Wet lab team and helping with external sponsorships for IGEM Concordia 2014. Working with such a diverse group of students, advisors, graduate students, and professors to make a huge project stand out at this year's competiton will definitely put all of my 3 years of studies at concordia into practice. In my spare time I like shopping, watching movies, swimming, travelling, and enjoying the company of my friends who are like family to me away from home. On the other hand, in science, I am mostly interested in the Biotechnology and biochemistry fields. Looking forward to compete! &quot;Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has thought.&quot; - Albert Szent-Gyorgyi </SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="biorow1"><SPAN class="textbox1"><H3>Hessam Kareimian Rad</H3><P>B.Sc. Computer Science  B.Sc. Specialization in Biology</P><SPAN>Hessam Kareimian Rad, Graduated from SBU university of tehran in computer sciences in 2009. While working as system designer at BRB trading company, he studied digital photography and design at Mahe Mehr school of fine arts in parallel. While working as a photographer for photo agencies and a freelancer on the side, he has found interest in natural sciences, which led him to move to Canada to continue his career in biological sciences at Concordia University of Montreal. Having the basis in computer science enables systematic approach, while recent studies in Genetics has inspired him with a whole new realm to be discovered. Holding the key to this great combination, provides him a precious chance toward his future career as a researcher in the field of Biotechnology and genetic engineering. </SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="biorow2"><SPAN class="textbox2"><H3>Lisa Walker</H3><P>B.Sc.

First, at Concordia Computational Intelligence Lab (CCIL) we research and develop solutions to problems in Artificial Intelligence and Evolutionary Computing as well as Pattern Classification and Image Processing. More specifically, we use tools including well-established methods from Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms to solve problems of written pattern classification and biomedical image segmentation. Our work has resulted in new methods for multiple ellipse detection in images, as well as new means of scheduling tasks on heterogeneous multi-processor machines.</SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV class="biorow1"><SPAN class="textbox1"><H3>Malcolm Whiteway, PhD</H3><P>Professor and Canada Research Chair in Microbial Genomics</P><SPAN>Our ongoing research investigates the medically important fungal pathogenCandida albicans, with the ultimate goal of identifying new treatment options for patients suffering from Candida infections. We use an array of genetic and genomic approaches to investigate pathways involved in various C. albicansfunctions.  As part of these efforts we collaborated with various international research teams in the assembly and annotation of the C. albicans genome. We are now using genome-based tools such as transcriptional profiling and ChIP-chip analysis to investigate regulatory circuits in the pathogen. We have identified dramatic cases of transcriptional rewiring of central metabolic pathways, synchronized cells and established the transcriptional profile of theC. albicans cell cycle, and investigated the regulation of the fungal mating system.</SPAN></SPAN></DIV><H2>iGEM Concordia 2014 Graduate Advisors</H2><DIV class="biorow2"><SPAN class="textbox2"><H3>Anas Ambri</H3><P>B.Eng.
