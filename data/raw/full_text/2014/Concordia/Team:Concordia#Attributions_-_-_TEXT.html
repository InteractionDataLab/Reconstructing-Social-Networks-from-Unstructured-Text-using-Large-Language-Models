iGEM Team Profile
We would like to thank Concordia University for their great help and generous support towards iGEM Concordia 2014.The completion of this project couldn’t have been done without the supervision of Dr. Malcolm Whiteway and Dr. Nawwaf Kharma as well as the guidance of the graduate students (mentioned below) in helping us with the many difficult technical and theoretical aspects of this project. Deepest gratitude are also due to Dr. Vincent Martin who allowed us to work in his lab throughout the summer and fall. Without this space and equipment, our project wouldn’t have been possible. We would also like to thank our sponsors and everyone else who supported iGEM Concordia.
