Amit Malhotra
B.Sc. Computer Science - Web Applications
B.Sc. Microbiology and Immunology
Amit graduated from McGill University with a major in Microbiology and Immunology, however, his career saw him on a completely different path.  After running his own business for 13 years in sales, marketing and information technology, he decided to do a second bachelor's degree, but in Computer Science, a subject he had grown fond of during his business venture.  He is currently studying Computer Science with a focus on Web Applications at Concordia University and works full-time at Radialpoint Inc. as an automation developer.  Sort of a workaholic, he enjoys the pressure full time studies combined with full time employment brings on and is always looking to combine his love of microbiology with his love of computers.
David Oram
B.Sc. Biology, iBBA, SCS
Hey, I’m David Oram from Newfoundland, Canada and am entering the last year of a B.Sc Biology at Concordia University. Before joining Concordia, I obtained an iBBA from Memorial University and gained my Canadian Securities Course (CSC) certification while working in investment banking.
Since returning to the sciences I am become enthralled with synthetic astrobiology and the promise of exponential technologies.  I am honoured to be apart of the only iGEM team from Quebec and am looking forward to representing Concordia on the International stage!
Dilan B Jaunky
B.Sc. Cell and Molecular Biology
"The world is my Oyster".
Cleverly written, this proverb has been a great mental moto to stimulate my desire to understand the world around me. My quest for a better awareness of myself seems to be tightly entwined with the Science of the living and Synthetic biology has granted me the opportunity to build upon this bond.
Elena Boueiri
B.Sc. Cell and Molecular Biology
I am Elena Boueiri, an undergraduate student at Concordia University. I am currently undertaking my last year of studies in the Cell and Molecular Biology program. This year, I am part of the Wet lab team and helping with external sponsorships for IGEM Concordia 2014. Working with such a diverse group of students, advisors, graduate students, and professors to make a huge project stand out at this year's competiton will definitely put all of my 3 years of studies at concordia into practice.
In my spare time I like shopping, watching movies, swimming, travelling, and enjoying the company of my friends who are like family to me away from home. On the other hand, in science, I am mostly interested in the Biotechnology and biochemistry fields. Looking forward to compete!

Hessam Kareimian Rad
B.Sc. Computer Science
B.Sc. Specialization in Biology
Hessam Kareimian Rad, Graduated from SBU university of tehran in computer sciences in 2009. While working as system designer at BRB trading company, he studied digital photography and design at Mahe Mehr school of fine arts in parallel. While working as a photographer for photo agencies and a freelancer on the side, he has found interest in natural sciences, which led him to move to Canada to continue his career in biological sciences at Concordia University of Montreal. Having the basis in computer science enables systematic approach, while recent studies in Genetics has inspired him with a whole new realm to be discovered. Holding the key to this great combination, provides him a precious chance toward his future career as a researcher in the field of Biotechnology and genetic engineering.
Lisa Walker
B.Sc. Cell and Molecular Biology
Lisa Walker is a 2nd year undergrad completing a bachelor’s degree in Honors Biology at Concordia University and received her DEC in Pure and Applied Sciences from John Abbott College. Concordia welcomed her with an Entrance Scholarship for high academic achievement as an applicant. During her years at Concordia University, her enthusiasm and fascination lead her to tailor her program of study towards Genetics and Cell Biology. Before graduating in May of 2015, her goal is to gain as much experience and knowledge as possible in the field of synthetic biology as an undergraduate in order to pursue a career in research.
Marta Bakinowska
B.Sc. Cell and Molecular Biology
I had a life of creation - art, graphics. I had studied architecture, web design and computer graphics. Then in short span of three months I lost a friend to leukaemia and my focus changed. Now I am a Cell and Molecular Biology undergraduate student at Concordia University. I hope that my studies and my future work in synthetic biology research will help in our fight with disease.
Melissa Gurnagul
B.Sc. Cell and Molecular Biology
My name is Melissa Gurnagul and I am a second year undergraduate student currently doing a Specialization in Cell and Molecular Biology. My main interests involve inherited disorders and the way they are treated. The ability to combine Synthetic Biology to these treatments is fascinating!  Feel free to contact me at melissa.gurnagul@hotmail.com :)

B.Sc. Environmental Biology
Hi, my name is Valerie Hayot-Sasson and I am a 2nd year Computer Science student at Concordia and have a previous bachelor’s degree in Environmental Biology. I’ve always been very interested in the computational applications to biology and hope to eventually become a computational ecologist.
Victor Yuan
B.Sc. Cell and Molecular Biology
Victor is currently completing a degree with honours in Cell and Molecular Biology. He is excited about being a part of the field of synthetic biology, and seeing what can come from it. In his free time, Victor enjoys learning new languages, and climbing mountains.
iGEM Concordia 2014 Primary Investigators and Team Leaders
Nawwaf Kharma, PhD
Associate Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering
My research interests are diverse, but may be placed into two large bins. First, at Concordia Computational Intelligence Lab (CCIL) we research and develop solutions to problems in Artificial Intelligence and Evolutionary Computing as well as Pattern Classification and Image Processing. More specifically, we use tools including well-established methods from Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms to solve problems of written pattern classification and biomedical image segmentation. Our work has resulted in new methods for multiple ellipse detection in images, as well as new means of scheduling tasks on heterogeneous multi-processor machines.
Malcolm Whiteway, PhD
Professor and Canada Research Chair in Microbial Genomics
Our ongoing research investigates the medically important fungal pathogenCandida albicans, with the ultimate goal of identifying new treatment options for patients suffering from Candida infections. We use an array of genetic and genomic approaches to investigate pathways involved in various C. albicansfunctions.  As part of these efforts we collaborated with various international research teams in the assembly and annotation of the C. albicans genome. We are now using genome-based tools such as transcriptional profiling and ChIP-chip analysis to investigate regulatory circuits in the pathogen. We have identified dramatic cases of transcriptional rewiring of central metabolic pathways, synchronized cells and established the transcriptional profile of theC. albicans cell cycle, and investigated the regulation of the fungal mating system.
iGEM Concordia 2014 Graduate Advisors
Anas Ambri
B.Eng. Computer Engineering
My name is Anas Ambri, and I am an an aspiring software developer (‘humble software developer’ was already taken, so I went for the next coolest title). I am a final year Computer Engineering student at Concordia University, and expected to graduate in May 2014. When I am not writing software to solve problems at Radialpoint, you can usually find me working on some personal projects, mumbling some words on my website, or learning new things. My ultimate goal is to own a pet tiger. PS: I know I am not supposed to tell you what to do, but, you know, you could always follow me on Twitter
