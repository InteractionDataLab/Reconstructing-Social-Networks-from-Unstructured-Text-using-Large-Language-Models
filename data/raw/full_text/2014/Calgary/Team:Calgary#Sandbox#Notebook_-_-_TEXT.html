In this section you can find information on our day-to-day work/activities over the summer. Since our team was divided into sub-groups, the journal is also divided into sub-groups to make it easier to track the progress of different aspects of the project.
In this section you can also find all of the protocols that we used and developed over the summer, a list of all the parts we submitted this year, and all of the references used on the website.
