University of Calgary
We graciously thank the Faculty of Medicine for access to labs, the Department of Biological Sciences and the Schulich School of Engineering Activities Fund. Additionally, we wish to thank the office of the Vice President of Research for their generous support.
Alberta Innovates Technology Futures
Alberta Innovates Technology Futures (AITF) facilitates the growth of technical industries by supporting quality research in Alberta's particular fields of expertise. These include nanotechnology, information communication technology, and genomics. AITF works in joint effort with entrepreneurs and researchers to ensure that Alberta’s technologies can be sustained at a business level through commercialization and growth.
O'Brien
The O'Brien Centre for the Bachelor of Health Sciences is part of the University of Calgary located in the Foothills campus. It is responsible for providing iGEM team with lab space as well as funding. The O’Brien Centre was founded in part by a generous $5-million donation by David and Gail O’ Brien, after whom the Centre was named. David O'Brien has been a member of the University's Board of Governors, while Gail O'Brien has chaired the Faculty of Medicine's Dean's Advisory Council. The O’Brien Centre is the hub of top-notch research, interdisciplinary research, and education. It is responsible for providing approximately $9-million/year for researchers. The 2014 iGEM team thanks O’Brien Centre for its generous contribution of the O’Brien Centre Summer Studentship as well as lab space this year
BioBasic
Bio Basic Inc. is committed to innovation and excellence. Bio Basic Inc. offers a breath of products and services to customers worldwide. Several of their product lines, such as, Molecular Biology Kits, Biochemicals, Synthetic Genes and Synthetic Oligos, have been widely recognized by customers worldwide.
GeekStarter
geekStarter is a program designed to facilitate next generation breakthroughs and achievements in research and innovation by offering funding to research projects proposed by Albertan institutions. geekStarter also fosters students' academic development by offering exclusive access to experts in various fields, a chance to participate in cutting-edge research, hands-on experience in entrepreneurial and presentation skills, and opportunities to hone and improve their projects in advance of local, regional, or international competitions. geekStarter supports teams of Albertan students in Nanotechnology, Information and Communications Technology, and Molecular Biology.
KAPA Biosystems
Kapa Biosystems was founded in 2006 to develop next-generation PCR reagents. Their molecular evolution technology platform is currently being used to optimize enzymes for DNA amplification, next-generation DNA sequencing, and molecular diagnostic applications.
Cumming School of Medicine
The Cumming School of Medicine (formerly the Faculty of Medicine) is a leading medical institute committed to a patient centered medical education and innovative medical research. Throughout its existence it has made several significant breakthroughs in medical science. It currently harbors 486 medical students, 767 residents, 190 post-doctoral fellows, and 491 graduate students. We sincerely thank the Cumming School of Medicine for their generous contribution of laboratory space and research funding.
Core DNA Services (University of Calgary)
Core DNA Services are a multi-user core facility and provide custom oligonucleotide (DNA and RNA) synthesis and automated DNA sequencing and fragment analysis services to both academic and commercial researchers.
TwistDx
TwistDx is a UK company that developed Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA), a novel isothermal PCR technology that is rapid, sensitive, low cost, and robust. Their isothermal PCR technology is targeted for use in point-of-use molecular assays, and provide flexible kits that include all reagents necessary for researchers to develop their own assays.
New England Biolabs
For over 30 years, New England Biolabs (NEB) has led the industry in the discovery and production of enzymes for molecular biology applications. Presently, NEB supplies more than 240 restriction enzymes, over 160 of which are available in recombinant form, as well as numerous recombinant DNA and protein modifying enzymes.
Schulich School of Engineering
The Schulich School of Engineering is an accredited engineering school that offers nine cutting-edge, engineering degree programs. It currently has 3,700 students enrolled at both undergraduate and graduate levels, along with over 150 faulty members. We would like to thank the Schulich School of Engineering for their generous assistance in developing our prototype device and other engineering endeavors.
