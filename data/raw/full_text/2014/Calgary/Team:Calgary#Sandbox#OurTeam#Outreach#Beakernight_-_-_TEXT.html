Beakernight
Beakerhead celebrates the advances and collaboration of science and engineering, for one week, the city  of Calgary turns into a “Giant Laboratory”. We collaborated with BGSA (Biological Graduate Student Association)  to participate in our biggest ever outreach event this year, Calgary Beakerhead Festival of Art, Science  and Engineering.  We aided with another “Bacterial Art” event on a city wide scale! Participants painted  with three strains of E coli, each expressing a different fluorescent protein. The petri dishes were then  stored overnight in an incubator, and all of the wonderful art was displayed Saturday night at the Grand  Finale, Beakernight. Before painting, we actively engaged the participants with two of our displays. A huge  display of the world map was constructed using nearly half a thousand petri dishes and carefully placed LEDs  blinking at the places malaria misdiagnosis is prevalent. A second display comprised of illustrations  demonstrating the science behind fluorescence and its modern day uses. Together, both the displays helped  us attract people into participating in “Bacterial Art” and learning about synthetic biology.
