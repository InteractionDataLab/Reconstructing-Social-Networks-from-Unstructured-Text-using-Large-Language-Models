Over the summer, I enjoyed working in a dynamic team of undergraduate and graduate students with different backgrounds. I love that iGEM is student driven and so interdisciplinary. While I am waiting for my models and animations to render, I can be found running, hiking, biking, reading or……studying. Some of the topics I like to explore on my free time include space travel, quantum physics, and effects of quantum physics in biology.</P><H3><A href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/alinakunitskaya/" target="_blank">View My LinkedIn Profile</A></H3></SECTION></SECTION><SECTION class="TeamMember"><SECTION class="MemberBio"><H2>Anna Fei</H2><H3>Health Sciences (4th Year)</H3><P>Everyone knows that Annas are pretty darn cool.

In the meantime I've dedicated my time, efforts, and sleep, to our iGEM project. I've lent a hand in most aspects of our project, but my focus has been on designing sample preparation and the genetic circuit itself. After lab hours I do my best to spend time outside, wandering about parks or enjoying good company in the woods. Otherwise I'm playing squash, longboarding, learning to cook a new dish, or reading a book. You can't do good science without a balanced life.</P></SECTION></SECTION><SECTION class="TeamMember"><SECTION class="MemberBio"><H2>Dave Curran</H2><H3>Bioinformatics (3rd Year PhD Candidate)</H3><P>I am the team’s returning iGEM veteran, having been a student with Calgary in 2007 and 2008, and leading the team in 2010. I like to think the team keeps me around for my experience and bioinformatics expertise, but they just think I’m old and bearded, and fixed the printer that one time. Oh well. Anyways, I like bioinformatics; modeling protein structures and sequence evolution is super cool. And parasitic worms are truly disgusting creatures (worse than you can imagine), so working on them is a lot of fun. When not working on my computer for work, I’m generally tinkering on my desktop at home, playing volleyball, or shreddin’ the pow (snowboarding for the unenlightened).</P></SECTION></SECTION><SECTION class="TeamMember"><SECTION class="MemberBio"><H2>Dennis Kim</H2><H3>Biomedical Sciences (2nd Year)</H3><P>This is my first year in iGEM and during the project I was involved primarily with the reporter and repressor operons used in our pathogen detection system.

I'm an avid traveller and unexpectedly spent most of the summer abroad, so I was a floater for the summer helping out wherever needed. Aside from travelling, I spend my time reading, binge-watching TV shows on Netflix or doing ballet. </P></SECTION></SECTION><SECTION class="TeamMember"><SECTION class="MemberBio"><H2>Israt Yasmeen</H2><H3>Health Sciences (4th Year)</H3><P>I am a fourth year student in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program. I have dedicated most of my summer to <I>B. subtilis</I> and getting it to transform efficiently. Being a member of iGEM has allowed me to venture into the world of synthetic biology, a field I was completely unaware of. When my time with <I>B. subtilis</I> does not go as planned, I give us some time by transporting myself to unknown lands and going on exciting adventures by reading books. Another way I travel is by listening to music from around the world. Apart from appreciating the diversity of lab racks, I have survived the summer by relying on something that has been a constant companion: Coke (the drinking kind of course).</P></SECTION></SECTION><SECTION class="TeamMember"><SECTION class="MemberBio"><H2>Jamie Fegan</H2><H3>Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases (4th Year PhD Candidate)</H3><P>This year marks my second year involved with the Calgary iGEM team where I have returned as a graduate advisor.

When I'm not comparing herding undergrads to herding cats, I can be found in the lab working on studying vaccine design and antigen engineering against the pathogen <I>Neisseria meningitidis</I>, the causative agent of meningococcal disease.
