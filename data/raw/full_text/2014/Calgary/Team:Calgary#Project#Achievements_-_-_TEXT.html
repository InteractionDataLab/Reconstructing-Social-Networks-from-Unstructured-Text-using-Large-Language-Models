Achievements
Policies and Practices:
Thoroughly researched our target markets and differing legislations that could affect our system
Connected with many different experts in the fields of infectious diseases, anti-malarial medications and public health to truly understand the needs and feasibility of the project
Connected with the foremost authority in low cost diagnostics, Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), to discuss the viability of our design and concept
Connected with a small village clinic in rural Uganda, which gave an opportunity to see the facility as well as discuss the topic with local physicians
Featured iGEM and our project on a global stage at the United Nations, in Geneva, and created discussion regarding the advancement of synthetic biology
Modelling:
Designed and manufactured a prototype of informed design based on our biological system
Cost analysis of our prototype and system to ensure that this project is feasible in developing nations
Quantified the visible threshold of detection for several reporters using time-lapsed cell count and absorbance readings, as well as a programmed colour sensor
Programmed an Arduino UNO microcontroller, colour sensor, and LCD screen to detect colour change among detection chambers, allowing for quantification of the colour
Applied circuitry of a heating pad/temperature considerations for ideal isothermal PCR conditions
Used Autodesk Maya Software to visually model and represent our system
Used Solid-works Software to model fluid flow analysis for different prototype designs
Transformation:
Transformed B. subtilis with a primer product containing 125 bp of  homologous sequence flanking our gene of interest
Modified and optimized general transformation: characterized effect of  changing xylose concentrations, temperature, and shaking
Optimization of transformation in small, liquid volume
Sporulated B. subtilis
Activated B. subtilis spores back to vegetative state
Isolated the master regular for competency, comK from the genome of B. subtilis using PCR and inserted it into a Biobrick vector for future application as an iGEM standard part.
Sample Preparation:
Demonstrated efficacy of isothermal PCR to amplify DNA sequences  without the need of a thermocycler, using freeze-dried components
Demonstrated ability to amplify target DNA sequence from whole E. coli cells in a blood mixture
Obtained specificity in target sequence primers - specific to numerous strains of N. meningititis but not other pathogens including a commensal strain of N. meningititis
Detection/Genetic circuit
Designed composite regulatory promoter sequences - used to allow repression of a downstream reporter with a specific repressor. Includes 5 variants of repressible promoters in either single or  triplicate repeats for variation in strength of repression
Demonstrated interaction (i.e. repression) between the reporter gene and repressor gene in E. coli
Demonstrated the efficacy of homologous recombination in B. subtilis and showed the minimum length of flanking sequences
Biobricked and submitted the full-length lacZ gene, previously non-existent in the latest  distribution plates
Constructed a reporter operon consisting of a constitutive promoter (Pveg), ribosome binding site, operator (C1434) and reporter (lacZ/RFP).
Constructed a complementary repressor operon consisting of a constitutive promoter (Pveg), ribosome binding site, and repressor pertaining to the operator. Repressor was also flanked with regions homologous to certain sequences within our pathogens of interest.
