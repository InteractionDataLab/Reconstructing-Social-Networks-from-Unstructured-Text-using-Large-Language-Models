B. subtilis Protocols
B. subtilis Preparation and Transformation (Zhang & Zhang, 2010)
Inoculate B. subtilis SCK6 pAX01-comK cells into 3mL LB medium with 1 μg/mL erythromycin and 1 μg/mL lincomycin in a test tube.
Cultivate cells overnight at 37 °C, shaking at 200rpm.
Dilute culture to an OD of 1.0 (OD600) in fresh LB containing 1% (w/v) xylose.
Grow cells for 2 hours at 37 °C, shaking at 200rpm.
Divide into aliquots and store at -80°C with 10% (w/v) glycerol OR proceed with transformation.
Add 1μL PCR product to 100 μL supercompetent cells in a plastic tube.
Cultivate cells for 1.5 hours at 37 °C, shaking at 200rpm.
Spread on LB plates (with appropriate antibiotic selection).
Incubate plates at 37 °C for 20 hours.
B. subtilis Preparation and Transformation (modified from Zhang & Zhang, 2010)
The changes to the original protocol are indicated by asterisks (*), and supported by figures where appropriate.
Inoculate B. subtilis SCK6 pAX01-comK cells into 3mL LB medium with 1 μg/mL erythromycin and 1 μg/mL lincomycin in a test tube.
Cultivate cells overnight at 37 °C, shaking at 200 rpm.
*Take initial absorbance reading at OD600 and calculate difference to 1.0; dilute to 1.0 with fresh LB using standard curve.
*Add 20% xylose for 2% final xylose concentration.
Grow cells for 2 hours at 37 °C, shaking at 200 rpm.
Divide into aliquots and store at -80 °C with *25% (w/v) glycerol OR proceed with transformation.
*Calculate volume for 400 ng DNA and add to 100 μL supercompetent cells in a plastic tube.
*Cultivate cells for >2 hours at 37 °C without shaking.
Spread on LB plates (with appropriate antibiotic selection).
Incubate plates at 37 °C for 20 hours.
B. subtilis Colony PCR
Pick a colony and resuspend in 50μL of TE buffer.
Heat for 5 minutes at 100 °C.
Spin down for 30 seconds and use 5μL for the PCR.
Making 2x SG Media for Sporulation of B. subtilis
Measure 16.0g Difco nutrient broth, 2.0 g KCl, and 0.5 g MgSO4∙7H2O. Add to large bottle and add distilled water for a 1L solution.
Adjust the pH to 7.0 and autoclave.
After cooling, add the following sterile solutions: 1 mL of 1M Ca(NO3)2, 1 mL of 0.1M MnCl2∙4H2O, 1 mL of 1 mM FeSO4, and 2 mL of 50% (w/v) glucose.
Generating and Harvesting B. subtilis Spores
Inoculate 10-50 mL of LB medium with cells from a fresh colony of B. subtilis
Grow for 6-8 hours at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm.
Dilute 1/200 into 50-10,000 ml 2xSG medium in an appropriate vessel and grow at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm.
After 2-3 days, over 90% of the population should be spores. Pellet cells at 9000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 °C.
Wash spores with ice-cold water 8-10 times.
Store at 4 °C with weekly changes of water OR at -20 °C for long-term storage.
Bacterial Smear
Glass microscope slides
Draw a one inch circle on the back of a glass microscope slide
Pipet 50 μL of distilled water in the circle and use a sterile inoculation loop to transfer a colony  of bacteria into this water
Fix bacteria on to the slide by running it through a flame a few times
Allow the smear to dry before performing any stains
Gram Stain
Crystal violet
Lugol's iodine
Safrinin
Flood bacterial smear with Crystal Violet for one minute
Rinse with distilled water
Flood with Lugol's Iodine for one minute
Rinse with distilled water
Decolourize smear using alternating applications of 95% ethanol for ten second and distilled water for  ten seconds until the water running off of the slide runs clear
Counter-stain with Safrinin for one minute
Rinse one last time with distilled water and pat dry with Kim-wipes
Gram-negative cells will stain pink or red, and Gram-positive cells will stain  purple or blue.
Spore Stain
Malachite green
Safrinin
Collect the spores for the smear from the suspended spores by centrifuging them for two minutes at 14,000 rpm,  and use an inocculation loop to collect the spores
Place slides onto a hot plate at 150 °C
Place a piece of paper towel over the smear to allow for complete flooding and steaming with Malachite Green
Continuously flood the paper towl to prevent drying for five minutes
Rinse with distilled water
Counter-stain with Safrinin for one minute
Rinse one last time with distilled water and pat dry with Kim-wipes
Cells will stain pink and spores will stain green.
