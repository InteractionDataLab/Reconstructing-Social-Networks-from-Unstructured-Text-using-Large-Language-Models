August 7
Objective: Backbone switching
Minipreps abandoned
Accidentally poured off the DNA-containing liquid into the waste container
Frozen stocks were saved--those can be grown to miniprep another day
pSB1C3-tracrRNA-dCas9 ligation (1 copy, need to test)
pSB3C5-R0040-anti-tracrRNA (4 copies, need to test)
More LB+Cm was added to empty culture tubes and grown at 37C
An attempt to salvage the minipreps--probably not useful
Objective: Sequencing
Order 1708

August 8
Objective: Backbone switching
Delta Ghoshal, Matthew Faw
Redo minipreps from yesterday - culture tubes grew overnight from salvaged cells
pSB1C3-dCas9-tracrRNA    - 171.3 ng/ul
pSB3C5-R0040-a-tracr 1    - 257.5 ng/ul
pSB3C5-R0040-a-tracr 2    - 202.7 ng/ul
pSB3C5-R0040-a-tracr 3    - 200.5 ng/ul
pSB3C5-R0040-a-tracr 4    - 198.3 ng/ul
Analytical digest of Tube 1 (pSB1C3-dCas9-tracrRNA) using XhoI and BamHI
2 hour digest at 37 degrees C
3X Master Mix:
3 ul Cutsmart
22.5 ul water
0.75 ul XhoI
0.75 ul BamHI
9 ul Master Mix added to 1 ul of pdCas9 in one tube and 1 ul of pSB1C3-dCas9-tracrRNA in another tube
Gel results were consistent with an unsuccessful ligation. 3 bands in the experimental column (4kb, 1.8 kb, and 0.9 kb) were expected. The results were more consistent with pSB1C3 and no insert. The band size in the pdCas9 control lane also looked wrong because it was too big. The pdCas9 tube may have been faulty or the BamHI might have been faulty.
August 11
Objective: Prepare chemically competent cells
Delta Ghoshal
The two types of cells to make competent were DH5-aZ1 cells containing the reporter gene and cells with the reporter and GFP1 site. Charlie started cultures on Saturday evening from a plate into LB + antibiotics. The antibiotics used were ampicillin in the reporter-only cells and ampicillin plus chloramphenicol in the reporter/GFP1 cells. On Sunday morning, he put them in the cold room and then took the OD that evening by adding 100 uL of culture to 900 uL broth plus antibiotics:
R: 0.276
R+G1: 0.268
He then started four cultures by adding 120 mL LB/appropriate antibiotic(s) to the following and growing them at 24 C:
70 uL R
0.7 mL R (denser culture)
70 uL R+G1
0.7 mL R+G1 (denser culture)
Today, at 10:25 AM, OD was measured again, but undiluted.
dense R: 0.023
R: -0.001
dense R+G1: 0.0037
R+G1: -0.000
Measurements were repeated at 12:34 PM, but only on the denser cultures.
dense R: 0.038
dense R+G1: 0.061
The temperature was increased to improve doubling time.

Delta Ghoshal, Charlie Cooper
Objective: Analyze gel from 8/11/14's analytical digest
Lanes 1-4 (pSB1C3-R0040-antitracr) identical and consistent with expected results (2000 and 200 bp bands)
Lanes 5-8 (pSB3C5-R0040-antitracr) not identical but should be. Expected was 2.7 kb, 36 bp, and 163 bp bands. 163 and 36 bp bands may blur together
Lanes 5 and 7 had a ~3 kb band and a ~200 kb band, which is unexpected
Lanes 6 and 8 may have worked.
Next steps: A second analytical digest to confirm these ambiguous results
Objective: Perform a second analytical digest using AgeI and XhoI
Gel Design:
Lane 1: pSB1C3-R0040-antitracr, tube #1 (from 8/5/14); Expected results: 892 bp and 1353 bp bands
Lane 2: pSB3C5-R0040-antitracr, tube #1 (from 8/7/14); Expected results: 323 bp and 2590 bp bands
Lane 3: pSB3C5-R0040-antitracr, tube #2 (from 8/7/14); Expected results: 323 bp and 2590 bp bands
Lane 4: pSB3C5-R0040-antitracr, tube #3 (from 8/7/14); Expected results: 323 bp and 2590 bp bands
Lane 5: pSB3C5-R0040-antitracr, tube #4 (from 8/7/14); Expected results: 323 bp and 2590 bp bands
6X Master Mix:
6 uL Cutsmart
1.5 uL AgeI
1.5 uL XhoI
45 uL dH2O
9 uL MM added to 1 uL DNA at 37 C
Results: Tube #1 of pSB3C5-R0040-antitracr had the expected results, so the remaining tubes 2-4 were discarded
Objective: Transform 8/11/14's CCEC with pSB4K5-J04450
Used tube #4 of pSB4K5-J04450 from 8/6/14 : 135.8 ng/uL concentration
10X serial dilution of DNA: 5 uL previous tube + 45 uL EB
6 transformants were 10^-1, 10^-2, 10^-3, 10^-4, 10^-5, and EB only
Cells were plated using appropriate antibiotics (Amp + Kan for Reporter only, Amp + Kan + Cm for Reporter+GFP1 cells)
August 13
Delta Ghoshal, Charlie Cooper
Objective: Analyze yesterday's transformation results
pink lawn on 10^-1 R and G plates, no colonies on other plates; unexpected
expected: 10-fold reduction in colonies on each successive dilution plate
could be explained by pipetting errors
Next steps: repeat transformation with following modifications:
Increase recovery time in SOC from 1 hour to 2 hours
Introduce antibiotics to the SOC media (Amp for R cells, Amp + Cm for G cells)
Use a 5-fold dilution instead of a 10-fold dilution
Instead of adding cells to DNA, add DNA to cells
Vortex the dilutions before adding them to the cell tubes
Objective: Retry transformation
Tube #4 of pSB4K5-J04450 was used again.
The 6 transformants were:
10X dilution : 3 uL DNA + 27 uL EB
5X dilution of 10X: 5 uL previous tube + 20 uL EB
5X dilution of (10^-1*5^-1): 5 uL previous tube + 20 uL EB
5X dilution of (10^-1*5^-2): 5 uL previous tube + 20 uL EB
5X dilution of (10^-1*5^-3): 5 uL previous tube + 20 uL EB
EB only

Next steps: transforming again with more dilutions, to eliminate possibility of pipetting errors skewing results. Starting from the lowest concentration from above (10^-1*5^-4), we will perform 10X dilutions.
Objective: Transform cells with highly dilute DNA
Accidentally left tube #4 of pSB4K5-J04450 on benchtop overnight, so used tube #1 instead, just in case. Concentration: 162.1 ng/uL
Dilutions:
10^-1: 5 uL tube #1 DNA + 45 uL EB
10^-1*5^-4: 5 uL previous tube to 625 uL EB
10^-2*5^-4: 5 uL previous tube to 45 uL EB
10^-3*5^-4: 5 uL previous tube to 45 uL EB
10^-4*5^-4: 5 uL previous tube to 45 uL EB
Transformation was done using the lowest 4 concentrations of DNA (not 10^-1). No control was tested, and yesterday's (8/13/14) modified transformation protocol was used.
August 15
Delta Ghoshal, Charlie Cooper
Objective: Analyze results of diluted transformation
The transformation was successful; each plate had fewer colonies than the previous.
Dilution:

Objective: Test validity of molecular titration approach using anti-tracr oligos and flow cytometry
Oligos ordered on Wednesday arrived today: 2 tubes of both antitracrDNA and not-antitracrDNA.  Calculations:

One tube of each was resuspended in dH2O: 82 uL in antitracr (A) and 71.4 uL in not-antitracr (NA). Then, 2 uL of each oligo were transformed into both R and G cells, using 8/14/14's protocol without recovery time. Starting at t=0 minutes, samples were taken and placed on ice in cold room every 30 minutes, from t=0 to t=240 (9 time points). Flow cytometry was used to analyze the expression of GFP.
Expected results:
Reporter Only Cells
Reporter + GFP1 Cells
A
GFP expression
GFP expression
NA
GFP expression
No GFP expression
The results differed from the expected, which is a preliminary indicator that this approach may not work. The flow results showed that G cells were in fact repressing some of their GFP expression, but both strains showed an overall increase in fluorescence over time. Also, there was no difference in results between the cells transformed with A and with NA. The experiment will be repeated again in the future, possibly with the following modifications:
Samples taken every hour, not half hour
Samples collected all day so there are more data points
Samples analyzed using flow cytometry immediately, instead of after being placed in cold room
