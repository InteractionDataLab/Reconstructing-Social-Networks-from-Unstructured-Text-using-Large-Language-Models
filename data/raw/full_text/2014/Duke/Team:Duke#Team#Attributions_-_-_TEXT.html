Matthew Farnitano
As one of the returning members from last year, Matthew helped to design the project. He also trained new members and was involved in wet lab work from April to August. He also designed the house course that is a part of our Policy and Practice.
Matthew Faw
Matthew participated in wet lab work, but was also responsible for the 3D-printing of different pieces of lab equipment. He also helped design the house course.
Garima Tomar
Garima assisted in wet lab work, but also acted as the liaison between Duke's iGEM team and the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM) iGEM team.
Delta Ghoshal
Delta participated in wet lab work and also designed, coded, and implemented this wiki.
Mike Zhu
Mike assisted with wet lab work and also did some mathematical modeling.
TJ Ciesla
TJ did some wet lab work and also mathematical modeling.
Janan Zhu
Janan participated in mathematical modeling.
Dr. Mike Lynch
Dr. Lynch provided valuable advice to the team in its early stages.
Dr. Charles Gersbach
As one of the principal investigators, Dr. Gersbach helped us by giving us advice as well as finding the funding sources to make this project possible.
Dr. Nicolas Buchler
As the other principal investigator, Dr. Buchler gave us advice, as well as lab space and equipment.
Charlie Cooper
Charlie gave the team guidance, as well as assisted us with several protocols. He was very closely involved and provided mentorship for all of us.
Additional Thanks
