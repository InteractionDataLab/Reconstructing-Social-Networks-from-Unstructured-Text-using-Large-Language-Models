Objective: Prepare Chemically competent E. Coli
Matthew Faw
Followed Charlie’s Cloning Protocols to prepare chemically competent E. Coli
Once E. Coli were prepared, the solution was aliquoted into 12 labeled tubes (450l in each tube) and tubes were stored in iGEM box in -80C cooler on far left
Next Steps:
Transformation
June 1
Objective: Transform Chemically competent E. Coli (CCEC)
Matthew Faw
Transformation of CCEC with RFP Construct of varying concentrations+control with no DNA
Followed Charlie’s Cloning Protocols
Mistakenly used all of DNA construct from the kit… So not sure if the transformation will be successful
Plated the transformed DNA and put in incubator at 37C
Results (6/2/14)--Transformation unsuccessful because improper procedure was done by MFaw
Next Steps:
Look at plates, compare cultures
June 2
Objective: Redo yesterday’s transformation
Matthew Faw
Due to my failure to correctly conduct the transformation yesterday, it was necessary to redo the transformation.
Followed Charlie’s Cloning Protocols
Added 1 ul of .5, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 0 (control) pg/lof RFP Construct to chemically competent E. Coli (CCEC), and followed procedure
Plated the transformed DNA on 6 separate plates, put in 37C overnight
Results: (6/3/14)-Transformation unsuccessful. Try the transformation again with Charlie’s cells and with new cells grown using iGEM’s protocol
Next Steps:
Look at plates, compare cultures, etc.
June 4
Objective: Prepare buffers and mediums for new CCEC protocol
Matthew Farnitano, TJ Ciesla, Mike Zhu, Charlie Cooper
Prepare SOB Medium for bacterial transformation
Protocol from iGEM’s parts website http://parts.igem.org/Help:Protocols/Competent_Cells
Made 1 L, autoclaved and stored in two 500 mL containers in cold room
medium still appeared cloudy before autoclave--may just be new recipe
Prepare CCMB 80 Buffer for making chemically competent E. coli cells
Protocol from iGEM’s parts website
Made 1 L, filtered and stored in two 500 mL containers in cold room
pH 6.34 (overshot a few times pH adjustment, but no noticeable precipitate formed
Autoclave two 500 mL culture flasks
For CCEC protocol
With water inside to remove detergent residues
Next steps:
Prepare CCEC
Objective: Attempt to grow some transformed cell cultures with Charlie’s CCEC
Matthew Faw
The second (and more properly conducted) attempt to transform the CCEC with RFP construct BBa_J04450 from 6/2 failed.  Today, we are trying to see if we can get any transformed cells to grow in plates.
Followed Charlie’s Cloning protocols,with slight modifications
Added 5 lof 0 (control) and 50pg/lRFP Construct BBa_J04450 to Charlie’s chemically competent E. Coli, and followed procedure
Plated the transformed DNA on 2 separate plates, put in put in 37C overnight
Results: No colonies grew (6/5/14)
Next Steps:
Examine plates to see if any cultures grew
Attempt the transformation with the cell cultures growns using iGEM’s standard protocols that can be found here :
Lab currently in the process of making these CCEC
Objective: Prepare pdCas9 marrafini and pCsy4 Arkin plasmids to be miniprepped
Matthew Faw, Charlie Cooper
Prepare pdCas9 and pCsy4 to be miniprepped tomorrow
Put pdCas9 into a culture tube with 5ml SOC+Chloramphenicol
Put pCsy4 in a culture tube with 5ml SOC+Amp
Left both to shake at 37C to grow the plasmid DNA--Charlie will retrieve them
Next steps:
Miniprep plasmid DNA
June 5
Objective: Attempt to grow some transformed cell cultures with Charlie's CCEC.
Matt Faw, Charlie Cooper
Results: Plates transformed 6/4 had no colonies (see for results)
Objective: Glycerol stocks and Miniprep our plasmid DNA
Matt Farnitano, Matt Faw, TJ Ciesla
Stored glycerol stocks (15% glycerol) of pdCas9 (A1) and pdCas9 (A2) at -80
Miniprep our pdCas9 and pCsy4
We miniprepped both pdCas9 and pCsy4 following standard protocol included in the miniprep kit.  We were unsure of how successful our miniprep of pdCas9 would be because it was low copy.
We took our own miniprep kit, prepared all solutions necessary, and labeled as ours.  Use this miniprep kit from now on.
We analyzed the concentrations of our plasmids with the spectrophotometer.
Results (6/5/14): Both minipreps were successful, with pdCas9 at concentration 103.4 ng/ulpCsy4 at concentration 138.1ng/ul
Stored in iGEM 2014 Box 1, A1 and A2
Next steps:
Wait for oligos ordered 6/4/14 in order to use these plasmids in construction.
June 6
Objective: Observe June 5 plates
Matt Faw
Results: the colonies that we left to grow in 2mL of SOB medium in the shaker at 37C didn’t grow…. Not sure if there’s a problem with the SOB medium, the cells, etc.  Today we’ll try growing various bacteria in the SOB medium to try to figure out what went wrong
Objective: Perform PCR on the pdCas9 template using oligos 5/18 and 6/18 that arrived today to obtain the desired biobrick sequence
Matthew Faw, TJ Ciesla, Charlie Cooper

Next steps:
Reconfirm plasmids
PCR pLac-RBS-GFP from K741002
PCR RBS-mCherry-Term from J06702
Isolate pSB1C3
SLIC to make pDGC3
Objective: Prepare biobrick plasmids for cloning
Diluted E. coli to grow to log phase for flow
DH5alpha (SOC), pSB1C3-BBa_J04450 (LB+Cm), and pSB6A1-BBaJ04450 (LB+Amp)
Each strain three dilutions: 1/100, 1/250, 1/500
Growing from ~10am
Note: Overnight culture of 1C3 had no visible red, but culture of 6A1 was strong reddish-pink. Possible that RFP is not expressed well in 1C3.
Flow Cytometry Parameter setting
1. calibration beads
2. messing around with parameters
3. pSB6A1-BBa_J04450 1/500 initial dilution
4. pSB1C3-BBa_J04450 1/500 initial dilution, 1/50 final dilution at flow time
5. DH5alpha 1/500 initial dilution, 1/50 final dilution at flow time
6. pSB6A1-BBa_J04450 1/100 initial dilution, 1/50 final dilution at flow time
7. pSB1C3-BBa_J04450 1/100 initial dilution, 1/50 final dilution at flow time
Notes: pSB1C3-BBa_J04450 showed strong, clear red fluorescence at both dilutions. pSB6A1 showed a bimodal fluorescence with some cells matching 1C3 fluorescence and others matching DH5alpha natural fluorescence. All samples showed two peaks of FS:SS data. These peaks did not correlate with the bimodal fluorescence seen in 6A1.
Parameters settled on (subject to change): FS: 350 volts, log 3 SS: 350 volts, log 3 Y2: 400 volts, log 5
Next Steps:
Perform formal data analysis
Objective: Create Csy4-gRNA-Csy4 Scaffold using G-block

June 12
Objective: Create Repeat-seq-Repeat construct and Csy4-gRNA-Csy4 construct
Results of transformation: no colonies on SLIC or Ligation plate
Controls also blank
Made new backbone for use (see below)
Overnight ligation of Repeat-seq-Repeat PCR with pSB1C3/p>
~100 ng backbone (2 uL) with ~30 ng insert (0.5 uL)
in 20 uL reaction
Two controls: one with no backbone, one with no insert
Left in heat block in cold room (16C) at 6pm for overnight ligation
Next steps:
Do a parallel room temp. ligation
SLIC of Csy4 construct
Transform all of the above, use Charlie’s CCEC until ours are confirmed
Objective: Obtain pSB1C3 backbone (various cloning uses)
Restriction digest of pSB1C3-K741002 and pSB1C3-J06702
25 uL each backbone in 100 uL reactions
SpeI-HF and EcoRI-HF in Cutsmart buffer (11am start)
Agarose gel of product for extraction
One lane looked as expected (2.0 and 0.8 kb bands)
Other lane had 2.0 kb backbone band but no insert band
possibly a faint band ~.1 kb
Extracted backbone (2.0 kb band) from both lanes separately
Gel photo:
Gel purification of pSB1C3
Used Zymoclean prep kit
Final elution:
Confirmed piece 20 uL at ng/uL (teal tube)
Unconfirmed piece 20 uL at ng/uL (orange tube)
Notes: it is possible that the lack of insert is due to mislabelled tubes. Analytical digests and reculturing of the three plasmids in pSB1C3 (K741002, J06702, R0040) will determine if this is the case and correct any mislabelling.
Objective: Create pDGC3
PCR of pLac-RBS-GFP from pSB1C3-K741002
With oligos pSB1C3-up and GFP-A-Z-3p
Four tubes with 0, 0.4, 0.7, and 1.0 uL template (diluted to 1 ng/uL)
iGEM protocol with 30 sec extension, 65C anneal
PCR of RBS-mCherry-Term from pSB1C3-J06702
With oligos 5p-Z-Asc1-RBS-mCherry
Four tubes with 0, 0.4, 0.7, and 1.0 uL template (diluted to 1 ng/uL)
iGEM protocol with 30 sec extension, 67C anneal
Agarose gel of PCR results
Lanes 1-4: pSB1C3-K741002 PCR
No product (fuzzy primer bands only)

Some product present at low concentrations
Gel photo:
PCR cleanup of pSB1C3-J06702 PCR
To see if low concentrations are enough to work with
<50 ng/uL present, need to redo PCR
Next steps: Redo PCR (once proper plasmids are confirmed), confirm, cleanup, SLIC
Objective: Prepare Chemically Competent E. coli
At ~11am, OD600 absorption rate for the cultures was .127 and .137
Aiming for OD600 of 2-3
Let grow for 50 more minutes (approx. one doubling time)
OD600 still low (.163, .178), let grow another hour
OD600 >0.2
Completed protocol as stated from iGEM website
Used conical-bottom tubes instead of flat-bottom, resulting in difficulty of resuspending cell pellets. Had to vortex pellets substantially to resuspend, which may reduce competence.
50-ml tubes used were smaller than those used by iGEM headquarters. Result was more tubes, each with suggested volume, so final culture was too dilute (OD < .1). Pelleted and resuspended in half the volume
Final volume 50 uL (for a double batch), in 50 tubes
Tubes in -80C new box, “iGEM chemically competent cells”
Next steps: Test competence with transformation of known circular plasmid
Objective: Reconfirm plasmids to check for mislabelling
Streaked single plate with frozen stocks of three plasmids in pSB1C3
K741002, J06702, R0040
All on same LB+Cm plate, because it was the last one
Need to make more
Incubated overnight at 37C
Next steps:
Culture, miniprep and digest to confirm correct insert
Digest current miniprep DNA as well
Re-label tubes if necessary
June 13
Objective: Reconfirm plasmids in pSB1C3 backbone (possible mislabelling event)
Analytical Restriction Digest of 3 plasmids (2 digests each)
Each plasmid in PvuII-HF and in EcoRI-HF/SpeI-HF
All reactions in cutsmart buffer
Note that plasmid names are as labelled, might not be what is present
Agarose gel of results:
1. pSB1C3-BBa_K741002 tube in PvuII-HF
2. pSB1C3-BBa_J06702 tube in PvuII-HF
3. pSB1C3-BBa_R0040 tube in PvuII-HF
4. pSB1C3-BBa_K741002 tube in EcoRI-HF/SpeI-HF
5. pSB1C3-BBa_J06702 tube in EcoRI-HF/SpeI-HF
6. pSB1C3-BBa_R0040 tube in EcoRI-HF/SpeI-HF
Results: No DNA in all K74 and J06 tubes. Tubes labelled R0040 appear to match expected for J06702
K74 and J06 were 1 ng/uL dilutions, so DNA was likely too dilute to show up
Hypothesis: R0040 and J06702 tubes are flipped. Possible that K741002 tube is incorrect as well
gel picture:
Objective: Create pDGC3 using biobrick parts
PCR of pLac-RBS-GFP from BBa_K741002
8 tubes, with two templates in 4 tubes each (0, .4, .7, 1.0 uL template)
“K” template is tube labelled as BBa_K741002 (1 ng/uL dilution)
“J” tube is tube labelled as BBa_J06702 (1 ng/uL dilution)
Trying in case this tube is mislabelled and contains K74
Oligos pSB1C3up and GFP-A-Z-3p
iGEM protocol with 30 sec extension time and 65C anneal
PCR of RBS-mCherry-Term from BBa_J06702
4 tubes at 0, .4, .7, and 1.0 uL template
Used tube labelled “R” as template
Suspect that this tube is mislabelled and contains J06
Oligos 5p-Z-AscI-RBS-mCherry and pSB1C3-down
iGEM protocol with 30 sec extension time and 67C anneal
Agarose gel of PCRs
Lanes 1-4: K741002 PCR with “K” template
Lanes 5-8: K741002 PCR with “J” template
Lanes 9-12: J06702 PCR with “R” template
Results: primer bands only on all K741002 lanes. Strong expected band in lanes 10-12 indicating succesful PCR of J06702
Further evidence that “R” is mislabelled and contains “J”

Enzymes SpeI-HF/EcoRI-HF in cutsmart buffer
42 uL DNA in 100 uL reaction for 4 hrs
Note: product frozen in iGEM cloning project box overnight
Need to run on gel to confirm and PCR clean to use
Objective: Culture colonies containing constitutive GFP for molecular titration approach
pSB1C3-B0030(as a control with no flourescence)
pSB1C3-K608008“strong promoter/medium RBS + GFP”
pSB1C3-K608010“medium promoter/strong RBS + GFP”
pSB1C3-K608011“medium promoter/medium RBS + GFP”
pSB1C3-K608012“medium promoter/weak RBS + GFP”

June 26
Objective: Check plates from 6/25/13 to confirm CIP activity
Check ∆Bbs1-8 and 9 Plates
Still many colonies on CIP treated plates, but much fewer than non-CIP treated plates
This leads to the conclusion that CIP still functions, but is not completely effective, leading to possible expression of self-ligation in CIP treated ∆Bbs1 experiments
Objective: Dephosphorylate Bbs1 cut pSB1C3-J06702 (mCherry)
Run dephosphorylation
3uL of Cutsmart and 1.5 uL of CIP added to 25 uL of mCherry plasmid, set in 37C for 45 minutes
DNA cleaned with Qiagen PCR Clean-up
Objective: Analyze the constitutive GFP expression of reporters using flow cytometry
Save stocks of Constitutive GFP plasmids

Notes:
K608008 showed no fluorescence--could be transformation problem or part problem.
K608010 had messier data for FSC/SSC and for GFP (B-1). Despite having the highest mean, this is not as reliable of a sample.
K608012 had the highest reliable mean, and should be used for at least the initial molecular titration experiments. K608011 is also useful if we need a lower maximum fluorescence level.
