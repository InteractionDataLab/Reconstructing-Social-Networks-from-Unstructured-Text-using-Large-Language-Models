Stability
Our subteam aims to test the stability of ten different Biobricks transformed in two different strains of Escherichia coli, XL1 Blue and DH5α . Stability is determined by subjecting the transformed cells to different types of stress and comparing the output with non-transformed ones     grown in the same conditions, as well as with cells transformed with an empty plasmid (without Biobrick).
Temperature Stress
We start out by establishing an overnight culture of each strain, every one of which will be subjected to the different temperatures. The experiment will be carried out in an improvised miniature system we just developed; PCR tubes filled with 75 µL of culture are placed in a thermo cycler, in which a     gradient of temperatures from 30-50ºC will be set. In each round, four replicas of two strains are to be tested simultaneously at 12 different     temperatures:

After an incubation period at the given temperatures the tubes containing the culture will be collected to measure the O.D. Fluorescence will also be     measured and later normalized to O.D.600, to compare the expression of the different Biobricks.
Material Fatigue
The idea is analogous to material fatigue in material sciences; in materials science , fatigue is the weakening of a material caused by     repeatedly applied loads. If the loads are above a certain threshold, microscopic cracks will begin to form at the stress concentrators such as the     surface, persistent slip bands and grain interfaces. In our case, we chose to induce the fatigue by subjecting the cells to temperature fluctuation, every     minute the temperature will be changed from 37ºC (E.coli optimum growth temperature) to 41ºC and back to 37ºC again, this way, the temperature     oscillates every minute from 37 to 41ºC for 4 hours. What will be the effect of such thermal fluctuations?
pH & Salinity
One of the best known factors that conditions bacterial growth is proton and salt concentration in the media. This experiment, as simple as may seem,     offers the opportunity to test cell viability as well as the Biobrick behaviour at different pH and salt concentrations. Overnight cultures of both strains     will be resuspended in different LB media with pH ranging from 5 to 9 and incubated for 90 minutes, after which O.D.600 and fluorescence of each     tube is to be measured. The design of the experiment is the same for salts, ranging from LB medium without salt to an extra 4% of salt, maintaining the     normal pH of the LB medium for all the tubes.
UV Radiation
As per today, high doses of UV light are proven detrimental to life, but, to what extent is it injurious to an E.coli cell? Is transformation a     factor that enhances the lethality of UV radiation or, contrary to what logic dictates, helps resist the UV radiation? Curiosity led us to design an     experiment which would answer these questions: overnight cultures of the strains will be diluted and spot-plated on LB agar. Subsequently, the spots will     be subjected to timed pulses of UV radiation (intensity of 340 µW/cm2) with a control that receives no UV irradiation at all. Thereafter the     plates will be incubated and fluorescence will be measured and normalized to O.D.600.
Vacuum
A simple experiment which mainly consists of exposing the cells, spot-plated on Petri dishes, to vacuum during 48 hours will be carried out; the output     from these, as always, compared to cells spot-plated and grown in optimal conditions, through OD600 and fluorescence assays.
