    In Synthetic Biology, two constructions can be considered orthogonal when they only interact at specific and predictable interphases, and do not disturb
    each other. We have studied this desirable feature of Biobrick parts by combining two constructions in the same cell and comparing this output with the one
    produced by simple transformations. According to our experiments, that were carried out in two different <EM>E. coli</EM> strains, Biobrick parts do not
    behave orthogonal when present in the same cell, being the expression of one of the parts 2 to 3 times higher than the other one. Then, we wanted to go un
    step further: what is the effect of a simple transformation (a plasmid with a Biobrick part) into the cell architecture? To get some insights about this,
    we are currently waiting for a proteomic analysis in which the whole proteome of an <EM>E. coli</EM> strain transformed with a Biobrick part will be
    compared to that of the non-transformed, control strain. </P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="General_protocol"> General protocol </SPAN></H2><P><UL><LI>

    We performed experiments with two different combinations of Biobrick parts containing a fluorescent protein under the control of a promoter sequence from
    Anderson’s promoter collection: Bb1 (GFP with strong promoter J23104) + Bb2 (RFP with strong promoter J23104) and Bb2 + Bb3 (GFP with less strong promoter
    J23110). In all cases, several controls were used: wild type (non-transformed) cells, simple transformations with either the biobrick or an empty plasmid,
    and co-transformations of the biobricks and the empty plasmids. In all cases there was a high background emission of red fluorescence by the cells. Our
    Results are shown in Figures 1 and 2.

    plasmids or empty plasmids were used as controls. Both green (505 nm) and red (592 nm) fluorescence intensity (FI) were measured for all samples and
    normalized by the optical density at 600 nm (OD600).

    Cells containing both Biobrick parts 1 and 2, Biobrick part 1 and an empty kanamycin plasmid (e.k.p), Biobrick part 2 and an empty ampicillin plasmid
    (e.a.p.), Biobrick part 1, and Biobrick part 2 were analyzed. XL1-Blue <EM>E. coli</EM> cells containing no plasmids or empty plasmids were used as
    controls. Both green (505 nm) and red (592 nm) fluorescence intensity (FI) were measured for all samples and normalized by the optical density at 600 nm
    (OD600).
  </DIV></DIV><P><STRONG>When in co-transformation, Bb1 and Bb2 showed a clearly asymmetric expression</STRONG>
    . <STRONG>Bb1 was highly expressed in comparison to Bb2 (2-fold in strain XL1-Blue and 3-fold in DH5</STRONG><STRONG>α</STRONG><STRONG>).</STRONG> A
    similar phenomenon was observed when either Bb1 or Bb2 were cotransformed with empty plasmids. Again, less fluorescence was detected in comparison to the
    simple transformants. Surprisingly, this fluorescence decay was strikingly different between both <EM>E. coli</EM> strains: Bb1 strongly lowered its
    expression in DH5α, whereas Bb2 showed a higher decay in XL1-Blue cells.
</P><P>
    However, the result was completely different when Bb2 and Bb3 were present in the same cell. In the XL1-Blue strain, the fluorescence intensity of Bb2 was
    as high as that of the single transformant, whereas the fluorescence of Bb3 –containing a less strong promoter- dropped dramatically. Fluorescence
    intensity of Bb3 was not detectable in strain DH5α under our experimental conditions.
</P><P><STRONG>
        With these results with co-transformants, we have to conclude that Biobrick parts, even if controlled by the same promoter and cloned into the same
        plasmid, are not expressed at similar rates.
    </STRONG>
    But, is this lack of orthogonality stable? In other words, is the asymmetric output always the same or it fluctuates depending on the culture? We designed
    a second experiment to answer this question. By performing several subcultures of the co-transformant strains -with five independent replica of each- and
    measuring the fluorescence output of each replicate after the subculturing steps, we will check whether fluorescence asymmetry is stable. On the other
    hand, we have only studied the average fluorescence in a population of cells in our experiments… but what are the variations between single cells? A simple
    experiment using flow cytometry can help us solve this question…
