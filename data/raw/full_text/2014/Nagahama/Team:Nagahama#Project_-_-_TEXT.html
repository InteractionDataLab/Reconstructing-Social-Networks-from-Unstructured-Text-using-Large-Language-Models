One Gene Has One Function
What is us project at 2014? Cadmium is one of a harmful material for us. 50 years ago, itai-iati disease was going around in center of Japan Gihu. And why itai-itai diserse was going around? The cause is industrial wastewater. Cadmium is contained the water. This water needs to be clean. Therefore, we thought how to clean the water. We think of be use E.coli. Concretely, we use two kinds of E.coli. One of E.coli catches Cadmium. Other close to all E.coli to use chemoattractant. Catches E.coli displays metallothionein (metallothionein is a protein that combines a heavy metal. Cadomium is one kind of heavy metal). Other is releasing Asp (Asp is one kind of chemoattractant. All E.coli is close to the Asp E.coli). To use these E.coli. Finally cadomiun is catched(wastewater is be clean).
