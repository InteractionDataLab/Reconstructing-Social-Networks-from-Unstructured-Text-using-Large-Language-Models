Accomplishments
- Created a reliable electroporation protocol for Bacillus Subtilis
- Developed a working seed sterilization protocol for our greenhouse control experiments
- Devised a genetic construct to produce phytosiderophores
- Reached over 7,000 school-age children through the ZipTrips program
- Engaged over 100 farmers and industry representatives at Beck's Hybrid's "Becknology Days" event
- Performed engineering and science outreach with urban children at the Christamore House
- Completed greenhouse control experiments with corn and rice to determine growth at varying iron levels
- Submitted five new individual parts and one new device to the iGEM registry
- Fully planned out a final greenhouse experiment using rice and corn plants with control plants, wild-type bacillus, and our engineered microbes.
- Created a full feasibility report and cost-benefit analysis of our Minecrobe solution
- Incorporated a lactose-inducible kill switch as a safety consideration into our project
- Collaborated with academic and industry experts to gain perspective on the problem and our solution
- Developed siderophore assays for characterization of our genetic construct
- Researched growth protocols for greenhouse plants and developed full growing and feeding schedules
- Created an implementation plan that scales up our project for industrial production
- Planned out a farmer-industry forum, with hopes to continue it next year
- Formulated a synthetic biology card game to help educate kids about genetic engineering
- Developed a video game to help educate children about our project and synthetic biology<p> <p>- Hosted a biotech workshop for 4-H high schoolers at our lab and taught them about genetic engineering<p>
