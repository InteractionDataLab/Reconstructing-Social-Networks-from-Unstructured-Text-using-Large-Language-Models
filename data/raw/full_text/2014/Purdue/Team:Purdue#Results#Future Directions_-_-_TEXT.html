Future Directions
Moving forward the team will be attempting to Gibson assembly our gblocks and then characterize our circuits in both E. coli and Bacillus Subtilis. We‘ve already purchased the necessary reagents and developed our protocols for assessment of phytosidderophore production. We plan on conducting greenhouse experiments with our microbes soon after. We will be testing the effect of having minecrobe directly in the soil vs. supplementing the soil with phytosidderophore media- produced by minecrobe. We have secured funding for this as independent research project and will be pursuing it to publication in a peer-reviewed journal.
