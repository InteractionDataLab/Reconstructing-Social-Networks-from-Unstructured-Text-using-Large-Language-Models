We think this is because of its passion and dedication towards each of its subjects; something we share! Our team is made up of 19 undergraduates from a range of disciplines, as well as our two supervisors and advisor.</P><H2>Undergraduates</H2><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Auriane Muse</H4><P><I>BSc Biology Second year</I></P><P>Auriane is a third year student studying for a BSc in Biology. Practically, her degree has been more focused on the ecological perspective. She researched the environmental aspects of the project and contributed to human practices and outreach events. </P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Cauã Westmann </H4><P><I>BSc Biology Third year</I></P><P>Cauã is a a final year visiting student from Brazil studying for a BSc in Biology. He has already been part of two iGEM competitions before with the USP-Brazil team and each event has been a unique opportunity to learn a lot and make new friends. He has been involved in the design of the project and BioBricks. He was also involved in wetlab work and social events such as European Researcher's Night held in York. When he is not doing science (or at least trying to) his hobbies include photography, travelling and cooking.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Ellie Davis</H4><P><I>BSc Biology First year</I></P><P>Ellie is in her second year studying for a BSc in Biology. She’s very interested in science communications and the role it has in the media. Apart from research and human practices, she’s been running social media sites for the team and has written several articles on the project for various University of York media.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Hanna Esser</H4><P><I>BSc Biochemistry First year</I></P><P>Hanna is a highly-organised second year biochemist. She helped to research the project and organise the lab work we undertook over the summer. When not iGEM-ing she likes outdoor activities like hiking and cycling.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Ivan Gyulev</H4><P><I>BSc Genetics Third year</I></P><P>Ivan is a Fourth Year student studying for a BSc in Genetics. This year is the second time he has participated in the iGEM competition. Ivan was involved in designing the final construct, cloning, characterising genes and making jokes. He also enjoys participating in outreach events such as European Researcher’s Night held in York.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Joseph Tresise</H4><P><I>MChem Chemistry Third year</I></P><P>Joseph is the only Chemistry student on the team and is currently working towards his Masters. His main responsibility has been the creation and design of the wiki although he also worked in the labs over the summer. His main hobbies are photography and many of his photos are used on the wiki to document our iGEM experience.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Lindsey Dalzell</H4><P><I>BSc Biology First year</I></P><P>Lindsey is currently a second year studying Biology with a Year in Europe, spending her third year in France. She has been working this summer on a mixture of lab work, human practices and parts of the wiki. In her spare time she takes part in a lot of volunteering, charity work and also attempts to be an enthusiastic Ultimate Frisbee player (with Ruth). </P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Marieta Avramov</H4><P><I>BSc Molecular Cell Biology First year</I></P><P>Marieta is a second year Molecular Cell Biology student from Varna, Bulgaria. She worked in the labs during the summer, and was involved in the Human Practices part of the project, mainly in doing the statistics for it. Whenever she has free time, she enjoys learning languages (already speaks 5!), singing and travelling.</P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Nikola Panayotov</H4><P><I>BSc Biochemistry Second year</I></P><P>Nik is currently a Third Year Biochemist on a Year in Industry. Originally from Bulgaria. This is his second participation in the iGEM competition. He was involved in team building, fundraising, social events and lab work (workshops for the First Year Students). Enjoys watching movies and football (Chelsea fan!).</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Ricardo Cañavate del Pino</H4><P><I>BSc Biochemistry Second year</I></P><P> Ric is a final year student with a soft spot for bacterial pathogenesis. As an iGEM 2013 veteran he was involved in recruitment, coordination and team building for this year’s competition. Inspired by the Portman Bay environmental disaster he has been focused on the design of the project and at the moment he is working on PYoda characterisation and the collaboration with Imperial College London.
Outside the labs he is a big Woody Allen fan and can’t wait to visit the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston!. </P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Robyn Whiting</H4><P><I>BSc Genetics First year</I></P><P>Robyn is a first year geneticist, she has been invaluable to the team this year, having being involved in fund-raising, outreach, human-practices and team organisation.  Robyn has great interpersonal, skills is incredibly organised and will always see a project though to  the end. Robyn took part in European researchers night and took part in the presentation in Boston. outside of the lab work Robyn is the president of the university of yorks baking society and like getting involved in the comunity. </P></DIV><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Ruth Haley</H4><P><I>BSc Biochemistry First year</I></P><P>Ruth is currently a second year studying Biochemistry with a Year in Industry. Ruth worked throughout the summer to research the project, finalise the idea, help design the gene constructs and complete lab work. She also presented our project at the Young Synthetic Biologists Conference. Aside from iGEM, Ruth enjoys creating music in her band and is a enthusiastic Ultimate Frisbee Player.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-md-4"><H4>Sarah Andrews</H4><P><I>BSc Molecular Cell Biology First year</I></P><P>Sarah is a hard-working second year Molecular Cell Biologist.
