Team Members
In just 50 years, the University has become one of the top in the UK. We think this is because of its passion and dedication towards each of its subjects; something we share! Our team is made up of 19 undergraduates from a range of disciplines, as well as our two supervisors and advisor.
Undergraduates
Auriane Muse
BSc Biology Second year
Auriane is a third year student studying for a BSc in Biology. Practically, her degree has been more focused on the ecological perspective. She researched the environmental aspects of the project and contributed to human practices and outreach events.
Cauã Westmann
BSc Biology Third year
Cauã is a a final year visiting student from Brazil studying for a BSc in Biology. He has already been part of two iGEM competitions before with the USP-Brazil team and each event has been a unique opportunity to learn a lot and make new friends. He has been involved in the design of the project and BioBricks. He was also involved in wetlab work and social events such as European Researcher's Night held in York. When he is not doing science (or at least trying to) his hobbies include photography, travelling and cooking.
Ellie Davis
BSc Biology First year
Ellie is in her second year studying for a BSc in Biology. She’s very interested in science communications and the role it has in the media. Apart from research and human practices, she’s been running social media sites for the team and has written several articles on the project for various University of York media.
Hanna Esser
BSc Biochemistry First year
Hanna is a highly-organised second year biochemist. She helped to research the project and organise the lab work we undertook over the summer. When not iGEM-ing she likes outdoor activities like hiking and cycling.
Ivan Gyulev
BSc Genetics Third year
Ivan is a Fourth Year student studying for a BSc in Genetics. This year is the second time he has participated in the iGEM competition. Ivan was involved in designing the final construct, cloning, characterising genes and making jokes. He also enjoys participating in outreach events such as European Researcher’s Night held in York.
Joseph Tresise
MChem Chemistry Third year
Joseph is the only Chemistry student on the team and is currently working towards his Masters. His main responsibility has been the creation and design of the wiki although he also worked in the labs over the summer. His main hobbies are photography and many of his photos are used on the wiki to document our iGEM experience.
Lindsey Dalzell
BSc Biology First year
Lindsey is currently a second year studying Biology with a Year in Europe, spending her third year in France. She has been working this summer on a mixture of lab work, human practices and parts of the wiki. In her spare time she takes part in a lot of volunteering, charity work and also attempts to be an enthusiastic Ultimate Frisbee player (with Ruth).
Marieta Avramov
BSc Molecular Cell Biology First year
Marieta is a second year Molecular Cell Biology student from Varna, Bulgaria. She worked in the labs during the summer, and was involved in the Human Practices part of the project, mainly in doing the statistics for it. Whenever she has free time, she enjoys learning languages (already speaks 5!), singing and travelling.
Nikola Panayotov
BSc Biochemistry Second year
Nik is currently a Third Year Biochemist on a Year in Industry. Originally from Bulgaria. This is his second participation in the iGEM competition. He was involved in team building, fundraising, social events and lab work (workshops for the First Year Students). Enjoys watching movies and football (Chelsea fan!).
Ricardo Cañavate del Pino
BSc Biochemistry Second year
Ric is a final year student with a soft spot for bacterial pathogenesis. As an iGEM 2013 veteran he was involved in recruitment, coordination and team building for this year’s competition. Inspired by the Portman Bay environmental disaster he has been focused on the design of the project and at the moment he is working on PYoda characterisation and the collaboration with Imperial College London. Outside the labs he is a big Woody Allen fan and can’t wait to visit the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston!.
Robyn Whiting
BSc Genetics First year
Robyn is a first year geneticist, she has been invaluable to the team this year, having being involved in fund-raising, outreach, human-practices and team organisation.  Robyn has great interpersonal, skills is incredibly organised and will always see a project though to  the end. Robyn took part in European researchers night and took part in the presentation in Boston. outside of the lab work Robyn is the president of the university of yorks baking society and like getting involved in the comunity.
Ruth Haley
BSc Biochemistry First year
Ruth is currently a second year studying Biochemistry with a Year in Industry. Ruth worked throughout the summer to research the project, finalise the idea, help design the gene constructs and complete lab work. She also presented our project at the Young Synthetic Biologists Conference. Aside from iGEM, Ruth enjoys creating music in her band and is a enthusiastic Ultimate Frisbee Player.
Sarah Andrews
BSc Molecular Cell Biology First year
Sarah is a hard-working second year Molecular Cell Biologist. She had numerous roles in the team such as: fundraising, laboratory work and organising outreach events such as European Researcher's Night.
Teodora Manea
BSc Biochemistry First year
Thea is currently starting her 2nd year studying Biochemistry. Thea has worked in the labs during the summer, designing our constructs and preparing our samples for submission to the registry. She has also organised and delivered outreach workshops in schools and developed ethics and sustainability surveys for the Human Practices part of our project. When she is not working on the iGEM project she enjoys not having nightmares about failed transformations.
Arushi Aneja: MEng Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence
Lucy Dye: BSc Biology First year
Maria Agapiou: BSc Biology First year
Tsvetelina Tsekova: BSc Genetics Second year
Vishnu Sunil: BSc Environmental Science Second year
Instructors
Dr. Gavin Thomas is a Senior Lecturer in Microbiology at the University of York who assisted our team as both scientific and personal mentor. His study into membrane transport proteins was incredibly useful as we constructed our Cadmium importing cell
Dr. James Chong is also a Senior Lecturer and Researcher of Methanogens and Anaerobic Bacteria at the University of York and who helped our team get a lab started and provided his own lab space when we needed to carry out additional experiments
Advisor
Rosanna Hennessy was a postgraduate researcher who helped us to design our synthesised genes and experiments. We wish her all the best in her new post at the University of Copenhagen.
