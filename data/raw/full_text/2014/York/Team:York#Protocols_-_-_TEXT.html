Gel Electrophoresis
Materials
For a 1% Agarose Gel:
1g Agarose
100ml de-ionised water
10μl sybrsafe™
Loading Buffer
Masking Tape
Procedure
Make 1% Agarose Gel:
Dissolve 1g of agarose in 100ml of deionised water.
Microwave for 2 minutes and check it is all dissolved.
Wait for it to cool
Add the sybrsafe™ (10μl) pour the gel into the mold and leave it to set for 15 minutes.
Preparing DNA samples to load into wells in the gel.
Add loading buffer to your DNA samples to help visualise the DNA running through the gel.
Performing gel electrophoresis:
Inject your DNA samples into the appropriate wells and use a HyperLadder for reference (left hand side).
Turn on the machine and make sure the black lead is attached to the black end and the red lead is attached to the red end. Black is negative, Red is positive. The DNA will move towards the red because it is negative.
Leave gel running for at around 30 minutes.
Take to U:Genius Image Capture in biolab one to see the DNA bands under UV light. Do not leave the UV light on for too long before taking the photo as this can degrade the DNA.

Competent Cell Production
Materials
100ml LB + 5ml for overnight culture
100mM CaCl2
85mM CaCl2, 15% glycerol v/v
Procedure
Streak competent cells onto agar plate and incubate overnight at 37 oC
Prepare and autoclave above solutions.
Inoculate a single colony into 5ml LB in a 50 ml falcon tube. Grow overnight at 37 oC, shaking at 200rpm.
Keep solutions at 4 oC overnight, and LB at 37 oC so that when cells get transferred they do not experience a temperature change.
Pre-cool the rotor of the centrifuge.
Use 1 ml of overnight culture to inoculate 100ml of LB in a 250ml bottle. Shake at 37 oC for 1.5-3 hours, until OD650 reaches 0.4-0.6.
Put cells on ice for 10 mins (keep cold from now on, and cool everything on ice before adding). Split into 2 x 50ml falcon tubes.
Centrifuge in the big centrifuge for 3 mins at 5000 rpm.
Decant supernatant and gently resuspend in 5ml cold 100mM CaCl2 by inverting tube slowly. (Cells susceptible to mechanical disruption)
Incubate on ice for 20mins
Centrifuge as before (3 mins at 5000 rpm)
Discard supernatant and resuspend in 2.5ml cold 100mM CaCl2/ 15% glycerol v/v
Pipette into microtubes and freeze in -80oC. (100µl per tube).
PCR
PCR with MyFi DNA Polymerase
5μl 5x MyFi Reaction Buffer
1ng Template

Add at end: Template (cells)
Working under sterile conditions, use a pipette tip to touch the colony to be picked. Use this to mark a cross on a second, clean plate, then dip the tip into the PCR tube.
For colony PCR use 10 minute initial denaturing step to lyse the cells.
