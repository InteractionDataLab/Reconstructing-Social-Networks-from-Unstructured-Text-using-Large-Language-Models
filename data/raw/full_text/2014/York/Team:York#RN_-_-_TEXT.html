Researchers night
European researchers night is an event that takes place simultaneously in more that thirty countries across Europe with over three hundred cities involved. This year on Friday 26th September York was one of the cities lucky enough to host a section of this event and we, as a team, were lucky enough to be allowed to get involved.
