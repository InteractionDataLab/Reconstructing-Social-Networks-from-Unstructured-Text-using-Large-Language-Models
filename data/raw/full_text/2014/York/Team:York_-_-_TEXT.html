Our project EcoCADMUS (E. Coli CAdmium DecontaMination Universal System)  aims to provide a safe and effective way to remove Cadmium and Sulfate from wastewater.

The Solution
Our project is a biological approach to solving an environmental problem; the removal of cadmium and sulfate from waste water. Our aim is to increase cadmium and sulfate uptake in our chassis, E.coli. Our system involves chelating cadmium intra-cellularly through over-expressing cysteine-rich phytochelatins. Find out more about our project here.

Outreach
As part of our project, we wanted to introduce the public to the concept of Genetically Modified Organisms and how they have a multitude of uses. Our outreach took us to many people and places as we explored the relationship between the public and Synthetic Biology
