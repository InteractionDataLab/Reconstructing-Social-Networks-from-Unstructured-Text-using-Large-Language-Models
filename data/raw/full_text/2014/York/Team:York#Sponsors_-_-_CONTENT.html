In particular, we would like to thank Deborah Smith, Jane Grenville, Ian Graham and Jim Woodcock from the Biology and Computer Science departments at the University of York for everything they have done for our team.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8"><P>YuFund is an organisation that financially supports societies that are ran by students at the University of York with the support of the university’s Alumni. The money that YuFund donated to us enabled us to synthesise our genes. We would like to thank Ellie Haines and Susie Fothergill for all of their guidance and support with raising funds.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8"><P>GenScript is a leading multinational biotech company specialized in biology research and drug discovery/development services. Headquartered in Piscataway, New Jersey, GenScript has become a world-leading Biology CRO and the largest gene synthesis supplier in North America, with subsidiaries and daughter company in Europe, Japan and China. In merely 10 years, GenScript has grown into a world leading biotech company with over 1,200 employees worldwide. We are very grateful for GenScript for the credit that they provided us with to synthesise our genes.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8"><P>Synbiota have produced and are developing an electronic laboratory notebook which allows up and coming research scientists to record their lab work. The company has sponsored numerous iGEM teams and have provided us with free access to their online lab book in addition to giving us financial support. We would like to say a huge thank you to Heather Mcgaw for all of her help.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8"><P>Croda is a world leader in natural based speciality chemicals which are sold to virtually every type of industry. The company has approximately 3400 employees, working in 34 countries. They kindly donated money to our project. In particular we would like to thank Clare Temple-Heald the Research and Technology Manager at Croda for her support.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8"><P>Yorkshire Water manage the collection, treatment and distribution of water in Yorkshire. They are a huge investor in the environment and have a mutli-million pound investment programme helping to make Yorkshire a cleaner, healthier and more enjoyable place to live.

It manufactures reagents including ultra-pure nucleotides, DNA polymerases and mixes, DNA markers, competent cells, products for RNA analysis and other general reagents for molecular biology. They kindly gave us a 40% discount on all purchases allowing us to buy reagents at a discounted price and enabling us to stay within our budget.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8"><P>BMG labtech: BMG LABTECH is a leading global developer and manufacturer of innovative, high-quality, and reliable microplate reader instrumentation. BMG loaned the iGEM team a micro-plate reader which is allowing us characterise our genes.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8"><P>Geneious develops online software that aids the work of molecular biologists. They provided us with software that enables us to design and create our constructs.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8"><P>SnapGene is a company that designs, develops and produces software that can be used in molecular biology. They provided us with free one-year accounts to allow us to design our constructs. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8"><P>Go Next provided us with a synthetic biology online handbook.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="row"><DIV class="col-lg-8"><P>New England Biolabs (NEB)  produces and supplies recombinant and native enzyme reagents for the life science research. NEB also provides free access to research tools such as REBASE, InBASE, and Polbase. They provided every iGEM team this year with free kits including competent cells and reagents required for three A assembly.</P></DIV></DIV><H2>Acknowledgements</H2><P><B>Dr Gavin Thomas, Dr James Chong, Dr Thorunn Helgason, Dr Leo Caves</B> and <B>Professor Maggie Smith</B> for providing their input and advice as Senior Lecturers. Our team is indebted to them for the guidance they gave regarding the feasibility of our project at the start and supervising our progress throughout. 
<B>Dr. Rosanna Hennessy</B> for helping us design our constructs and ensuring a trouble-free synthesis. 
<B>Dr Michael Schultze</B> and <B>Dr Daniel Ungar</B> for attending our Sponsors event and giving input and feedback about our presentation and project. 
The lab technicians, <B>Jen Lee, Sam Farrell</B> and <B>Nikki Begg</B> who kept our lab supplied and organised, while helping with any technical problems that arose over the summer. 

Again, we would like to mention <B>Dr Erica Kintz</B> and <B>Dr Marjan van der Woude</B> for providing us with some <I>E. coli </I> mutants and with 96 well plates for our characterisation. <B>Dr Alison Parkin</B> for providing us with Cadmium chloride to characterise our constructs.
<B>Dr Andrew Leech</B> for giving us advice on the design of our characterisation experiments.
<B>Bruna Cama </B> for drawing the diagram for our final construct, <B> Victor Ribas </B> for the time he spent helping us decide on the style of our wiki and <B>Phil Roberts</B> for providing design advice that created this wiki you are reading. 
The 2014 York iGEM Team would like to thank all of the above for their advice and guidance throughout this competition, we know it wouldn't have been possible without these people giving up their time to aid us! Thank you very much!
