The nature of democracy is one of fast but short-term improvement as policy makers have only a matter of a few years in which to prove themselves. This is reflective of human nature: we crave instant gratification at the cost of long-term improvement. However, today more than ever before it is clear how powerfully our actions impact our future. We need to build a more sustainable society.  Our project aims to improve environmental sustainability of important industry by making the processes they use less environmentally damaging in the long run. However, part of what makes planning every project so challenging is that to be truly sustainable, it must be sustainable in every aspect. This is why our human practices are so important.
Cadmium in Global Waters
Cadmium in natural waters exists as either free/aquated cation (Cd2+/CdOH+)[1] this is due to the competition of organic binding resulting in aluminium causing the almost complete displacement of cadmium.
A large amount of cadmium pollution in water ways is due to either industrial waste or fertilizers produced from phosphate ores. In unpolluted natural waters the cadmium concentrations are usually below 1μg/l[2] however the maximum level ever recorded was in Rio Rimao in Peru at 100μg/l[3].  The WHO have set the guideline level of cadmium in global drinking waters as 3μg/l[4] In 2007 UNEP stated these would be the parameters set for water quality as a global index[5].

Cadmium Contamination Effects on Humans
The main issues with cadmium getting into waterways and food supplies are the affects that it will have on the people who ingest it. The effects of cadmium poisoning can be devastating as it is a known carcinogen and can consequently lead to death if ingested in large quantities. The other l effects of cadmium ingestion include:
Gastrointestinal effects such as nausea, vomiting, salivation, abdominal pain, cramps and diarrhoea[1]
Anaemia due to the cadmium resulting in a lower level of iron intake in the gastrointestinal region, this is especially problematic if the affected individual already has low levels of iron intake in their diet[2]
Kidney damage is a common symptom of cadmium toxicity which further leads to a decrease in production of vitamin D[3]
Osteomalacis and osteoporosis both of which lead sufferers to have increased chance of bone fractures and lower bone density [4]. This may be as a result of the kidney damage giving way to decreased levels of vitamin D. [5]
