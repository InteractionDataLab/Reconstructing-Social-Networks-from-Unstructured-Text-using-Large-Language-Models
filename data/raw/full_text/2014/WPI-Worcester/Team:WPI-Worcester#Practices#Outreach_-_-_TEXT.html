We invited a Women in Science day camp to come come and visit the lab.    The camp consisted of 30 middle school girls that were split into 6 groups of 5.    We organized 3 different activities that the girls rotated through.

Contaminated Water
To teach the girls from the Women in Science Day Camp about bacteria that can    be engineered to perform certain functions, we designed an activity which uses    bacteria to detect pollution in water. When a plasmid containing the arsenic    dependent promoter (part BBa_J33201) and the ribosome binding site, ATF1 gene,    and double terminator construct (part BBa_J45199) in introduced into E. coli,    isoamyl alcohol will be converted into isoamyl acetate when arsenic, or any    other heavy metal, is present. Thus, water contaminated with heavy metals    will smell like bananas. When a plasmid containing the tetR promoter, ribosome    binding site, BSMT1 gene, and the double terminator (part BBa_J45120), salicylic    acid will be converted to methyl salicylate in the presence of the antibiotic    tetracycline. Thus, water contaminated with antibiotics will smell like wintergreen.    The cloning of the banana arsenic construct was not complete by the time    the campers arrived so the pollution detecting E. coli could not be used. Instead,    cultures of non-transformed E. coli were prepared. Methyl salicylate was added     to samples that were 'contaminated' with antibiotics and isoamyl acetate was added    to samples that were 'contaminated' with heavy metals. This set up allowed the    campers to perform a safe sniff test without any actual contaminants.
Build-a-DNA
We thought it was unlikely that 5-7th graders would have a firm understanding     of how DNA works based on what they’ve most likely learned in school so far. In order    to help them grasp the concept in a hands-on way that’s fun and easy, we had them build    their own codon out of colorful paper pieces representing deoxyribose, phosphate groups,    and nucleotides. All of the pieces were cut out ahead of time to save time and make the     project more enjoyable for the girls, and a sample was built for them to use as a guide     and to help us explain the different parts of DNA more visually as they constructed their     own. While they were putting their codons together, we explained how DNA works as a code    'read' by bacteria to make proteins and what the different combinations of nucleotides might     mean. To make things simpler, we used 'instructions' as a metaphor: you can't build a bike     that works if you don’t know how to put the pieces together.    The girls got to take their codons home as a reminder of everything they learned.
