Quantifying ATF1
The ATF1 enzyme converts isoamyl alcohol to isoamyl acetate, which gives off a strong banana odor. The conversion of isoamyl alcohol to isoamyl acetate can be monitored using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Thus, the efficiency of the ATF1 enzyme can be characterized.  We have constructed two different biobricks that include the ATF1 gene. The first biobrick, K1423007, is a construct consisting of an arsenic inducible promoter, a ribosome binding site, the ATF1 gene, and a double terminator. The second biobrick, K1423008, consists of a high strength constitutive promoter, a ribosome binding site, the ATF1 gene, and the double terminator.
