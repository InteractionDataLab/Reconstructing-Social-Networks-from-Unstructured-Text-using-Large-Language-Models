Our Team
Our team worked in pairs throughout the summer. We would like to thank team members Alex Turland and Chloe LaJeunesse for doing the heaviest portion of wiki coding along with graphic design, designing our agglutination assay, performing our agglutination assay and microscopy. We would like to thank team members Shawna Henry and Corbyn Lamy for performing the majority of our cloning procedures and sequence analysis, creation of our farmers survey, and for singing Frozen karaoke. We would like to thank team members Kayla DeSanty and Michael Giroux for their work in the wetlab to improve the characterization of a biobrick, distributing and analyzing our farmer survey, and for analyzing our GC/MS data. All of our team members worked together to build the content for the wiki.
Advisors
We would like to thank our advisors Professor Natalie Farny and Professor Joseph Duffy for their guidance throughout our project including assistance with trouble shooting as well as feedback and critiques on our work throughout the summer and the beginning of the school year. We would also like to thank Professor Duffy for allowing us to use his lab space to complete our work.
WPI Faculty
We would like to thank Professor Andy Butler for assisting us with performing gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy and for assisting us with the GC/MS results analysis. We would also like to thank Professor Jagan Srinivasan and Professor Joseph Duffy for allowing us to present our work to their classes Advanced Molecular Genetics and Introduction to Biotechnology, respectively. We would also like to thank Professor Liz Ryder for advising us on possible modeling techniques using simulation software for our project.
WPI Organizations
WPI Biotech Club
