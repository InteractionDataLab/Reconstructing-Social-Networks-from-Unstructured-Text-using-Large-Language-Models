☑
Improve the function OR characterization of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year), enter this information in the Registry. We improved the characterization of the ATF1 Enzyme and Heavy Metal Promoter BioBricks !
☑
Help any registered iGEM team from another school or institution by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system. We collaborated with BU and MIT!

☑
Experimentally validate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected. We conducted two successful Proof of Principle experiments for our BCLA Biobrick!
☑
Document the characterization of this part in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry. Here is the link to the Characterization for our BclA N-Terminal Domain BioBrick.
☑
Submit this new part to the iGEM Parts Registry (submissions must adhere to the iGEM Registry guidelines).Here is the link to the Registry Page for our BclA N-Terminal Domain BioBrick.
☑
iGEM projects involve important questions beyond the bench, for example relating to (but not limited to) ethics, sustainability, social justice, safety, security, or intellectual property rights. Articulate at least one question encountered by your team, and describe how your team considered the(se) question(s) within your project. Include attributions to all experts and stakeholders consulted. Here's our experience with Beyond the Bench questions!
