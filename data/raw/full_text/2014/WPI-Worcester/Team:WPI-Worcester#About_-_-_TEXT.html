The Coding!
All the coding for the wiki was done by Alex Turland!
He didn't know how to use html or css prior to this project, so it was a great learning experience!
He apologizes for any browser incompatibilities that may arise from all of the crazy css! (Chrome is recommended for optimal viewing.)
No javascript was used in the making of this wiki!
Third-person descriptions however, were used!
The Art!
All the art and designs were made by Chloe LaJeunesse!
Alex helped with some of them!
