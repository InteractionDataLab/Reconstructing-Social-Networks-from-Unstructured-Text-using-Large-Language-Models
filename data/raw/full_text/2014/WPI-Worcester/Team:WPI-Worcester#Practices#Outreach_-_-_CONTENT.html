			The camp consisted of 30 middle school girls that were split into 6 groups of 5.
			We organized 3 different activities that the girls rotated through.</P><A href=""> Download the Curriculum Here</A></DIV><DIV class="textitem"><H1>Rainbow Gel</H1></DIV><DIV class="textitem"><H1>Contaminated Water</H1><DIV class="bigtext">
			To teach the girls from the Women in Science Day Camp about bacteria that can
			be engineered to perform certain functions, we designed an activity which uses
			bacteria to detect pollution in water. When a plasmid containing the arsenic
			dependent promoter (part BBa_J33201) and the ribosome binding site, ATF1 gene,
			and double terminator construct (part BBa_J45199) in introduced into E. coli,
			isoamyl alcohol will be converted into isoamyl acetate when arsenic, or any
			other heavy metal, is present. Thus, water contaminated with heavy metals
			will smell like bananas. When a plasmid containing the tetR promoter, ribosome
			binding site, BSMT1 gene, and the double terminator (part BBa_J45120), salicylic
			acid will be converted to methyl salicylate in the presence of the antibiotic
			tetracycline. Thus, water contaminated with antibiotics will smell like wintergreen.
			The cloning of the banana arsenic construct was not complete by the time
			the campers arrived so the pollution detecting E. coli could not be used. Instead,
			cultures of non-transformed E. coli were prepared. Methyl salicylate was added 
			to samples that were 'contaminated' with antibiotics and isoamyl acetate was added
			to samples that were 'contaminated' with heavy metals. This set up allowed the
			campers to perform a safe sniff test without any actual contaminants. 
			</DIV></DIV><DIV class="textitem"><H1>Build-a-DNA</H1><DIV class="bigtext">
			We thought it was unlikely that 5-7th graders would have a firm understanding 
			of how DNA works based on what they’ve most likely learned in school so far. In order
			to help them grasp the concept in a hands-on way that’s fun and easy, we had them build
			their own codon out of colorful paper pieces representing deoxyribose, phosphate groups,
			and nucleotides. All of the pieces were cut out ahead of time to save time and make the 
			project more enjoyable for the girls, and a sample was built for them to use as a guide 
			and to help us explain the different parts of DNA more visually as they constructed their 
			own. While they were putting their codons together, we explained how DNA works as a code
			'read' by bacteria to make proteins and what the different combinations of nucleotides might 
			mean. To make things simpler, we used 'instructions' as a metaphor: you can't build a bike 
			that works if you don’t know how to put the pieces together.
			The girls got to take their codons home as a reminder of everything they learned.
