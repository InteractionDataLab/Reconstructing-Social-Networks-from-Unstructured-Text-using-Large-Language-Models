DATA PAGE
Engineered E. coli to reduce the sulfate component of marble black crust.
DATA ON OUR FAVORITE PARTS
BBa_K731030 : Inducible arac-pBAD promoter regulating M256I CysE.       A serine acetyltransferase (M256I CysE, our Part BBa_K731010 ) controlled by an arabinose inducible system (our Part BBa_K731201 ).        This is a key part in our black crust project: a device used to reduce sulfate and produce cysteine.
BBa_K731400 : IPTG inducible Cysteine desulfhydrase (CysDes). Our favorite BioBrick encoding a cysteine desulfhydrase, controlled by an IPTG inducible cassette (our Part BBa_K731500 ). This is the second key Part for the Crust Away project. This BioBrick produces an enzyme that uses cysteine as the substrate to form hydrogen sulfide.
WE HAVE ALSO CHARACTERIZED THE FOLLOWING PARTS
BBa_K731020 : Inducible araC-pBAD promoter regulating CysE. A device to produce WT CysE upon induction with arabinose.
BBa_K731040 : Inducible araC-pBAD promoter regulating a sfGFP tagged M256I CysE. This is our favorite part BBa_K731030 followed by a sfGFP. The device was created by Gibson assembly.
BBa_K731480 : IPTG inducible sfGFP tagged cysteine desulfhydrase. (CysDes). This is a sfGFP tagged version of our best BioBrick BBa_K731400 . A device created by Gibson assembly.
BBa_K731201 A new version of the araC-pBad promoter that was amplified from the E. coli genome. An excellent alternative to BBa_I0050 .
BBa_K731500 Our Part BBa_K731300 followed by a tac promoter and a lac operator. A BioBrick for those interested in expressing their gene under the control of IPTG.
DATA OF OUR COMPLETE PATHWAY AND APPLICATION ON THE STATUES
We have also successfully characterized our complete pathway consisting of Parts BBa_K731030 and BBa_K731400 in vivo and used it to clean marbles from the Black Crust.        Read more on our Project page .
PROJECT: Terminator 5
DATA OF OUR FAVORITE PARTS
BBa_K731700 : Platform for terminators analysis under the control of T7 promoter.       Our measurement device for terminators characterization. A T7 promoter controlling the expression of A206K Venus and mCherry for the ratiometric analysis of terminator efficiency.
BBa_K731710 : Platform for terminators analysis under the control of tac promoter.       Our platform BBa_K731722 , where T7 promoter was substituted with Ptac.
BBa_K731721 : T7 terminator.       Our new entry in the terminator collections of the registry: a T7 terminator! This terminator was characterized in vivo and in vitro with both T7 and E. coli polymerases.
BBa_K731722 : T1 terminator from E. coli rrnB       A good working alternative for the E. coli terminator BBa_B0010 .
DATA ON PREEXISTING PARTS:
BBa_B0010 : T1 terminator from E. coli rrnB
