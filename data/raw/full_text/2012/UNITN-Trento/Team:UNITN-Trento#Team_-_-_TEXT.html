iGEM Trento 2012
Selection was made using Ampicillin
We are six students attending the bachelor course in Biomolecular Sciences and Technologies at University of Trento.        Although it could seem a small team composed of students of the same background, our interests space widely from literature and music, web-design, climbing and parties.
We were not alone in this amazing experience, though. We were sustained by a rich group of people who helped us in very different situations.
Jason
Jason Fontana is a Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari student in Trento. He is a blogger, self-made web designer and a sort of IT consultant.           He writes and mostly links about technology at jasonfweb.com , writes in 140 characters at Twitter ( @jasonfweb ) and is on Facebook too.
Guzz
Francesco Guzzonato is a Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari student in Trento. He is a wannabe writer, with little effort and decent achievements - top 25 in Campiello Giovani 2009. Probably you could read his works somewhere online, but he doesn't remember where he posted them. You can find him on Facebook or email him .
Ross
Daniele Rossetto is a Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari student in Trento. He is a science enthusiast and an incurable optimist. He loves letting his mind flow and talking about the craziest things and situations, you better stop listen and run when you hear the words "and what about..." or be involved in some odd idea! Daniele is eager to know new people so contact him on Facebook or by email .
Andrea
Andrea Tassinari is a Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari student in Trento. Sometimes she is a chess player, sometimes sort of A bass player. She loves warm places: sooner or later you will find her on a lonely island, sole with the sound of her Musicman. God save the funk. We also take care of statues, of course.
Giaco
Giacomo Giacomelli is a Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari student in Trento. He really likes talking with everyone about things that are important to him and he is often so much involved into the talking to appear a bit rude.
If you want to argue about something or just to contact him you can find him on Facebook or by email . Come at me Bro.
Anna
Anna Depetris is a Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari student in Trento. She likes music and nature, but she studies too much. She likes arguing too, and probably she is shouting with Giaco now.      You can contact her by email , at your risk.
