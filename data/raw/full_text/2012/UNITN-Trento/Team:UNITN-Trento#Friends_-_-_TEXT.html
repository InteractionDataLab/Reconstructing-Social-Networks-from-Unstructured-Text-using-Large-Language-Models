iGEM Trento 2012
Our Friends
During this journey we have met and worked with many friends that made this project possible. We would like to thank them for their suggestions and support. Please forgive us if we have forgot you! It was not intentional.
We’d like to thank the Faculty of Science of the University of Trento and CIBIO for believing in this project and supporting us.
Thank you to prof. Alessandro Quattrone and prof. Alberto Inga for participating in our brainstorming sessions and supporting us.
Everybody from the Mansy lab has been helpful in several occasions and allowed us to use their materials. A special thank you goes to Roberta Lentini and Laura Martini, who are also our advisors and to Fabio Chizzolini who helped us with in vitro fluorescence measurements.
Prof. Graziano Guella helped us out with some chemistry tips!
A special thank goes to Damiano Avi in the physic department, who helped us out with gas chromatography and to design our Crustanator!
Rossella Tomazzoli, Margherita Kos, and Matteo Grott our favorite technicians were extremely helpful and manage not to go crazy with all our confusion!
Efrem Bertini helped us out with initial FACS meaurements. Unfortunately we were not able to use our platform for FACS. Thanks anyway Efrem!
People at Genechron , not only supported us with free sequencing, but they also worked around our needs several times!
Nadia Groff helped us with the logo design.
Mattia Dalsass helped us under the chemical hood.
Marzia Filippi from the Safety Office revised our SRB handbook.
Enrico Mariottino for helping us with the video interview. He spent with us a fun Sunday afternoon to edit the video we took at the artist's studio.
Georgia Gabrielli and Miriam Sebastiani of the communication office of UNITN helped us with the graphic of the SRB handbook and the poster.
We received also help from many of the administration people at the University of Trento:
Patrizia Paoli, the secretary of CIBIO, helped us in several occasion and she is always ready to wear a smile.
Nicola Mazadro, Bianca Andrighettoni, Alberta Giacomoni and Giorgia Moser from the ordering office speed up our orders to make sure we received our material in short time and we did not miss registration!
Lucia Osele and Luisa De Carli, from the Dean office, were extremely kind and helpful with our registration and traveling booking.
We are also working with the Museum of Science:
We'd like to thank Patrizia Famà, who is working at the development of the new Museum of Science of Trento participated to our brainstorming sessions and shared with us her experience. In the next months, it is planned that we will take part to the Open Days for High School students at the Museum. We're also helping to the development of an "iGEM Corner" within a permanent Synthetic Biology Exposition at the Museum.
Many helped us in the search of the right black crust:
Momi and Maurizio Sammartini who shipped us by mail a piece of an old Venice palace by mail!
Paola Sgado’, collected pieces of marble directly in Carrara for us.
Francesca Demichelis gave us some other marble samples.
Prof. Flavio Deflorian of the Engineering department is our expert in Black Crust. He accepted to be interviewed and came to the lab for help with statues applications.
We received small pieces of marbles from many different places in Trento, ranging from the Cemetery, to a Marble factory, to a sculpturist.
Marchioro, Maddalena Antonio and Fornasa Marmi Design kindly gave us some samples to test on.
Passamani brothers for the nice tour in the marble world.
Thank you to all of them.
