iGEM Trento 2012
Our Supervisors and Advisors
Supervisors
Cristina
Given her educational and research training Cristina Del Bianco is not sure anymore if she is a chemist, a structural biologist, or a biochemist, which probably means that she's a perfect synthetic biology fit! She likes hiking, baking American-style cakes (e.g. Martha Stewart pies!!!), anything that has to do with crafting, knitting, and sewing and of course iGEM!
Sheref
Sheref Mansy has been at the University of Trento for the past three years. He grew up in the great state of Ohio. He enjoys the lovely Trentino mountains, Korean food, and building in vitro cellular mimics. More information on his work can be found at smansy.org .
Olivier
Olivier Jousson is directore of Scienze e Tecnologie Biomolecolari program at the University of Trento. He currently works on virulence factors of pathogenic bacteria, but his early research and best rememberings had to do with molecular ecology of fish parasites, in particular tremendous diving experiences in protected areas from the Mediterrean Sea. He is not interested exclusively on the microbial world: he also likes Sicilian food and playng the guitar.
Advisors
Roberta
Roberta Lentini gave up her personal life to join the PhD programme in the Armenise-Harvard Laboratory of Synthetic and Reconstructive Biology at the University of Trento. She likes running, even if coordination is not her best friend. She has a passion for fluorescent proteins, and everything that has a shadow of fucsia. If you want to find her, stop by CIBIO at ANYTIME with a beer (including weekends!).
Laura
Laura Martini is a PhD student in the Armenise-Harvard Laboratory of Synthetic and Reconstructive Biology at the University of Trento. She graduated in Modena and now in Trento she misses a lot tortellini. She loves Science and Sherlock Holmes at the same level. Sometimes she is a little bit obsessed by contamination, her motto is "think steril, be steril!".
