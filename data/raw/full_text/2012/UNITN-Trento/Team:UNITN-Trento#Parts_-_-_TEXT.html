Our Parts
Here you can find our Best Parts and all the Parts we built. Make sure to check out our Team Parts Page on the Registry website !
BEST PARTS
K731030 - Inducible araC-pBAD promoter regulating M256I CysE
A serine acetyltransferase (CysE) controlled by an arabinose inducible system.
This is a key part in our black crust project: a device used to reduce sulfate and produce cysteine.
K731400 - IPTG inducible Cysteine desulfhydrase (CysDes)
Our favorite BioBrick encoding a cysteine desulfhydrase, controlled by an IPTG inducible cassette. This is the second key part for the Crust Away project. This BioBrick produces an enzyme that uses cysteine as the substrate to form sulfidric acid.
K731722 - rrnB T1 terminator
Our new entry in the terminator collection of the Registry: a functioning version of BBa_B0010 ! This terminator was characterized with both T7 and E. coli RNA polymerases.
All Our Parts
Please note that many parts have been also subcloned into low copy vectors. Although these parts have note been submitted to the registry, they are available upon request. Contact us at igemtrento [at] gmail [dot] com
The Black Crust Enzymes
K731000 CysE (Serine Acetyltransferase)
A Part encoding CysE, our key enzyme in the reduction of sulfate.
K731010 M256I CysE (Serine Acetyltransferase)
This is a mutated CysE. Introduction of a Methionine at position 256, makes our key player even "stronger" and enhances sulfate uptake.
K731020 Inducible araC-pBAD promoter regulating WT CysE
A device to produce CysE upon induction with arabinose. Also available in pSB3C5.
K731030 Inducible araC-pBAD promoter regulating M256I CysE
A device for the production of M256I CysE controlled by an arabinose inducible cassette. This Part was used for the bioremoval of the black crust from different stones samples. Also available in pSB3C5.
K731040 Inducible araC-pBAD promoter regulating a sfGFP-tagged M256I CysE
This is our favorite Part BBa_K731030 followed by a sfGFP. Created by Gibson assembly.
K731400 IPTG inducible Cysteine desulfhydrase (CysDes)
Our favorite Bi Bbrick encoding a cysteine desulfhydrase, controlled by an IPTG inducible cassette. This is the second key Part for the Crust Away project. This BioBrick produces an enzyme that uses cysteine as the substrate to form sulfidric acid. Also available in pSB4K5.
K731480 IPTG Inducible sfGFP tagged Cysteine desulfhydrase (CysDes)
This is a sfGFP tagged version of our best BioBrick BBa_K731400. A superfluo device created by Gibson assembly.  Also available in pSB4K5.
Terminators
K731721 T7 terminator
Our new entry in the terminator collections of the Registry: a T7 terminator! This terminator was characterized in vivo and in vitro with both T7 and E. coli polymerases.
K731722 rrnB T1 terminator E. coli terminator
A good working alternative for the E.coli terminator BBa_B0010 .
K731700 Platform for terminators analysis under the control of T7 promoter
Our measurement device for terminators characterization. A T7 promoter controlling the expression of A206K Venus and mCherry for the ratiometric analysis of terminator efficiency.
K731710 Platform for terminators analysis under the control of TAC promoter
Our great platform BBa_K731722 , where T7 promoter was substituted with Ptac.
K731701 BBa_K731700 with T7terminator (BBa_K731721)
A measurement device used to characterize T7 terminator under the control of T7 promoter.
K731702 BBa_K731700 with BBa_K731722 rrnB T1 terminator (BBa_B0010)
A measurement device used to characterize B0010 terminator under the control of T7 promoter.
K731711 BBa_K731710 with T7 terminator (BBa_K731721)
A measurement device used to characterize the T7 terminator ( BBa_K731721 ) under the control of tac promoter.
K731712 BBa_K731710 with BBa_K731722 rrnB T1 terminator ( BBa_B0010 )
A measurement device used to characterize the E.coli terminator ( BBa_K731722 ) under the control of tac promoter.
Promoters
K731201 Inducible araC-pBAD promoter
A new version of the araC-pBad promoter that was amplified from the E.coli genome. An excellent alternative to BBa_I0050 .
K731300 LacI + LacIq promoter (reverse)
A ready to go IPTG inducible cassette that is composed of LacI controlled by the lacIq promoter, both in the reverse direction.
K731500 [LacI + LacIq promoter] reverse + [tac promoter + lac operator] forward
Our Part BBa_K731300 followed by a tac promoter and a lac operator. The perfect BioBrick for those interested in expressing their gene under the control of IPTG. It will save you a lot of cloning steps! Also available in pSB4K5.
K731250 Inducible araC-pBAD promoter with GFPmut3b, strong RBS
A device for the characterization of our new entry araC-pBad ( BBa_K731201 ) followed by a strong RBS and a GFPmut3b. Also available in pSB3C5.
K731255 Inducible araC-pBAD promoter with GFPmut3b, weak RBS
A device for the characterization of our new entry araC-pBad ( BBa_K731201 ) followed by a weak RBS and GFPmut3b.
K731520 IPTG inducible GFPmut3b
A device for the characterization of our new BBa_K731500 followed by a strong RBS and GFPmut3b. Also available in pSB4K5.
