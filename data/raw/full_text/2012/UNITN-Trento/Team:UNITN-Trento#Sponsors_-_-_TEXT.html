iGEM Trento 2012
Thank you!
Gold Sponsors
Fondazione Cassa Rurale di Trento is our main sponsor. This project, and personal experience for us is possible only because of them. We'd like to express our gratitude for this opportunity.
EraSynBio generously covered part of our registration expenses to go to Boston. We are proud to represent European Synthetic Biology at the MIT Jamboree.
Silver Sponsors
Bronze Sponsors
T-Shirts Sponsors
Orostube and the kind people that made donation during the CIBIO BBQ sponsored our T-Shirts.
