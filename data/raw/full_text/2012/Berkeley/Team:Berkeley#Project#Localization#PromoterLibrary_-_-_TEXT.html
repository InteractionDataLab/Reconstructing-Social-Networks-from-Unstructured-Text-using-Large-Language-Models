Narrow pixel brightness range (25-1000):
Vacuolar Membrane
Actin
Plasma Membrane
Nucleus
pTDH3
This strain of yeast cells did not grow; the over expression of the protein killed the cells.
The RPL18B promoter already made the nucleus very bright, so we did not need a stronger promoter.
pTEF1
This strain of yeast cells did not grow; the over expression of the protein killed the cells.
pRPL18B
pRNR2
pREV1
