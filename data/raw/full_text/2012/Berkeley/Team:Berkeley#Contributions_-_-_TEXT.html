Many of our basic parts (promoters, terminators, RBSs, and fluorescent proteins) are courtesy of the Dueber lab.
The iGEM team chose the targeting proteins/sequences from the literature and either PCRed them from genomic DNA or synthesized them, built all of the composite parts, and assayed them.
The leucine zipper sequences were courtesy of Amy Keating's lab, in a collaborative effort to identify an orthogonal interaction set. The iGEM team constructed the MiCoded leucine zippers and assayed them.
The Golden Gate assembly of our multigene and MiCode cassettes was designed and performed by the iGEM team.
On the software side, the iGEM team wrote the MATLAB code, constructed the Cell Profiler pipeline for automated image analysis, and tested it using images generated by the iGEM team.
