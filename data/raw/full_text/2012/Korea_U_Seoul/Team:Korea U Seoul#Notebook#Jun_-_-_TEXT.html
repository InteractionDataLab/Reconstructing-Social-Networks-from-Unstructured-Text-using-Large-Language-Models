Team:Korea U Seoul/Notebook/Jun
From 2012.igem.org
Notebook : June
A. June, 4, 2012
Today, we discussed about main topic and preliminary topic which are bacterial logic gate and carbon fixation using carbonic anhydras
1) Idea development
  Jeongmin Lee, Kyeongjin Kim: DNA logic gate
     reviewed a paper on DNA gate by KAIST 2012
     Possible to make logic gate (XOR, NOR, AND, OR) based on DNA
     Mechanism: DNA hairpin: input DNA is complementary to output DNA which releases florescence.
     Half adder possible, but requires further research on full adder
  Hyunkee Kim
      Deoxyribozyme based logic gate
  Jang Kyeongwoo Jang
     Progress on XOR logic gate
     Possible candidate for XOR logic gate is .Lux R operon and Las R operon which is orthologous to each other
     Promoter design
      ① las - lux - output
      ② lux - las – output
     output is the same protein. When two signals are simultaneously given, each operon inhibits transcription. In effect, this results in no transcription at all
  Jihoon Jung
     researched on output-input chemicals
     One was substance that uses quorum sensing
     For example, AHL(Acyl-homoserine lectone)
     Since each bacteria uses different AHL, signal won’t mix up
  Sanghoon Han
     researched on output-input chemicals
2) Next meeting
     Carbonic anhydrase : Byeongnam Min, Haerim Song, Ji Hyoung Nam
     DNA logic gate : Jeongmin Lee, Kyeongjin Kim, Wonuk Lee
     Plasmid logic gate : Hyunkee Kim, Jang Kyeongwoo Jang, Jihoon Jung, Sanghoon Han
     Half adder, full adder completion: everyone
B. June 25, 2012
Today, we discussed about main topic and preliminary topic which are bacterial logic gate, Molecular Beacon, and carbon fixation using carbonic anhydrase.
1) Idea development
  Jeongmin Lee, Kyeongjin Kim: DNA logic gate
      Possible to make logic gate (XOR, NOR, AND, OR) based on DNA
      Nearly impossible if more than half adder is used. (Note: longer DNA is required).
      As DNA gets longer, price for synthesis is getting higher and even more when protein is attached to DNA.
  Hyunkee Kim, Kyeongwoo Jang, Sanghoon Han, Jihoon Jung
      need to unify input signal and output signal
     Improvement on modeling of full gate.
     If input and output are the same, these can interfere in signal transfer.
     That is to say, input chemical must be destroyed once it gives signal to adjacent promoter..
  Back up idea team ( Jihyong Nam, Byeongnam Min,  Haerim Song, Dohoon Kwon)
     Haerim Song: Inhibition of virulence of bacteria on plant – type 3 secretion
  Sponsor (Dohoon Kwon, Wonuk Lee)
     in order to get funding, we need to have presentation on our research or submit a report.
2) Next meeting
     From next week, we will have our regular meeting on Wednesday 8p.m
     Before next meeting, research the problems and limitations that we discussed during our regular meeting
