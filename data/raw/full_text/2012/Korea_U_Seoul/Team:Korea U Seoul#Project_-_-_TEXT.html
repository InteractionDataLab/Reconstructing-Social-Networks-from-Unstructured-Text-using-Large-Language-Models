Overall project
Making binary adder by adopting logic gates operated by biological system.
Logic circuit is an operation system consists of sets of various logic gates such as AND, OR, XOR, NOR etc.. that interact with each other to draw certain outputs from input signals. Among various logic gates with lots of applications, our project will design biological XOR, AND, and OR gates, and by arranging the gates in proper order with certain supplementary system we've designed, we will make working half adder and full adder in sequence to complete biologically operating binary adder.
To achieve our purpose, we're considering 2 methods : 1) building circuit by arranging dish with bacteria containing modified plasmids. 2) building circuit by using molecular beacon probes - DNA molecules designed by certain sequence we want with fluorophore and quencher molocules attaced to each end.
In case of 1) method, we've developed  our idea further to schematizing level and if each part works properly, final goal is to make actual full adder with complete physical arrangement considering time and concentration for actual flow of signal molecules. In case of 2) method, we're still considering it to develop but we've faced limitation in this method.
