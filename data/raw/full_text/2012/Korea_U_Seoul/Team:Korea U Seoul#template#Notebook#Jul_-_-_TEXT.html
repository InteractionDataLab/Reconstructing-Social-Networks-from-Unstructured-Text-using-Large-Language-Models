2012 iGEM 12th meeting - July 18, 2012
1. Idea discussion based on previous meeting with professor
I) Production of 'Spider Silk' (Hyunkee Kim, Jihoon Jeong)
-Cloning the target gene is easy but the challenging factor of the idea is yield of the product.
-Continuous study is required to color the produced spider silk.
-Glycine(monomer of the spider silk) degradation can be overcome by over expression of glycine.
-The monomer of the spider silk must be bigger than 150kDa because spider silk consist of short monomers can be easily broken and useless.
-After the mass production of the spider silk monomer, the cell must be homogenized. Addition of the acid makes the spider silk monomer to water-soluble and can be purified. Hand spinning can obtain spider silk.
II) Expiration date (Jihoon Jeong)
-Milk can stay fresh for 50 days, if the package have not opened before.
-Other factor whether the package was opened or not is important factor as time and temperature for expiration date, so it is hard to apply to bacteria.
-Abandoned
III) Piezo-electric battery (Haerim Song)
-Uses piezo-electric and M13 phage
-Coat protein of the M13 phage has a dipole --- so if the phage is pressed hard enough, it generates the electricity.
-Appling this concept to bacteria is our final goal, but seems hard to succeed.
2. Teams for further develpment of some ideas above
-Logic gate : Jihoon, Sanghoon
-Spider silk : Hyunkee, Jihoon, Kyungjin, Byeongnam
-Piezo-electric battery : Jeongmin, Haerim, Jihoon, Sanghoon, Jihyong, Wonuk
