Team:Korea U Seoul/Notebook/Aug
From 2012.igem.org
Notebook : August
A. August, 1, 2012
We have discussed about how to dectect and kill 'Xanthomonas oryzae’
1) Idea development
  Haerim Song
     raxR/H is target for raxSTAB.
     Sulfur plays an important role in activity of AX21; it won’t work without sulfur
     overexpression of raxST(sulfur attachment to AX21), RaxR/Q(transformation of PAPS into ATP) is possible in E.coli
  Advisor’s advice
      test any promoter which binds to raxR/H
      is it possible for Xanthomonas to produce AX21 without plant receptor?
      (Professor’s comment) we can run a test using E/coli which has plant receptor
      Method for detecting AX21 production?
      (Professor’s comment) use mass spectrometry or put florescence after ax21 gene then cut with restriction enzyme
  Jihoon Jung
     Find A
  Kyeongwoo Jang’s opinion
     find system which utilizes logic gate in natural world
2) Next meeting
     (1) research rax operon
      How to detect Ax21 : HyunKee Kim
      Research raxR/H paper : Byeongnam Min
      Research Xanthomonas : Jeongmin
      Activity of the substance only with raxR/H:  Haerim Song
     (2) team
      Logic gate: Jihoon Jung, Kyeongwoo Jang
      Science camp presentation:  Haerim Song
      Wiki update: Byeongnam Min, Kyeongwoo Jang, Sanghoon Han
      Notebook translation: HyunKee Kim
      Study Modeling: Sanghoon Han, Byeongnam Min
      Design team: Jeongmin Lee, Kyeongjin Kim, Jihyong Nam, Haerim Song
B. August 8, 2012
We have discussed about how to dectect and kill 'Xanthomonas oryzae.’ Solidifying the idea and circuit
1) Idea development
      raxR, raxH can be detected using His tag; however, experiments using cloning technique don’t use this.
      No indication of functional opetation only with raxR, raxH
  Haerim Song
      raxH without transmembrane segment was autophosphorylation, but no raxR transphosphrylation.
      raxH H222 and RaxR D51 is responsible for phosphorylation.
  Lab team
      acquisition of PCEL, raxRH promoter, mRFP using PCR
      cloning is expected to be held this week
      raxR/H is constitutive, so use other promoter
2) Team placement and H.W
     logic gate: find A: Sanghoon Han, Jihoon Jung, Kyeongwoo Jang
     Ax21 production: Wonwook Lee, JungMin, Kyeongjin, Haerim Song, Byeongnam Min, Hyunkee Kim
     Brochure: Jeongmin Lee, Kyeongjin Kim, Jihyong Nam,  Haerim Song
     Science camp presentation:  Haerim Song
     Wiki update: Nam, Byeongnam Min, Kyeongwoo Jang, Sanghoon Han
     Notebook translation: HyunKee Kim
     Study Modeling: Sanghoon Han, Byeongnam Min
     Design team: Jeongmin Lee, Kyeongjin Kim, Jihyong Nam,  Haerim Song
     CCP: Sanghoon Han
     KAIST Contact; Byeongnam Min
     Team attire: Jihoon Jung
     upload at least one copy of design to the homepage (mandatory)
C. August 15, 2012
We have discussed about how to dectect and kill 'Xanthomonas oryzae.’ Solidifying the idea and circuit
Idea development
  Kyeongwoo Jang: logic gate biosensing
      researched logic gate used by organism to detect certain chemical
      British Columbia University already did similar project; it was about concentration dependent color changing bacteria.
      Logic gate using single step is more efficient than using several input and output steps
  Sanghoon Han: finding ‘a’ chemical
      DSF(diffusible signaling factor)
  Haerim Song: bacterial leaf blight
      had presentation about iGEM during ‘Lifescience camp’
      in order to prevent bacterial leaf blight, chemical-pesticide was given. However, it was proven to be ineffective.
      Bacterial leaf blight resistant plant was developed but, later sub-population eliminated effect of ‘gene R.’
  Wonwook Lee: sponsor
      LG lifescience, Celltrion, Rural development administration, cosmogenetech: yet positive reply, he will continue to contact.
  Sanghoon Han
      Small Protein-Mediated Quorum Sensing in a Gram- Negative Bacterium (PMID : 22174954) To elucidate this function, we previously isolated and characterized eight genes required for Ax21 activity (rax genes). raxA, raxB and raxC encode components of a predicted type I secretion system (TOSS). Ax21requires this RaxABC TOSS for activity and secretion [3,4]. The RaxB protein carries two highly conserved N terminal proteolytic subdomains characteristic of transporters in Gram-positive bacteria that cleave N-terminal peptides prior to substrate secretion [4]. These data, together with the presence of a predicted N-terminal signal sequence in Ax21, suggest that Ax21 is cleaved by the RaxB transporter prior to secretion. raxST, raxP and raxQ encode enzymes involved in sulfation
      This indicates AX21 is synthesized without a plant
2) Design
     Benchmark : http://www.linocoms.co.kr/index.htm
     need to use ‘Flash’ program
3) CCP: report due on 24th (logic gate and DIY)
D. August 22, 2012
We discussed about our wiki page design, content, uniform design, and part allocation.
1) iGEM participation fee
      Regional Jamboree registration : 275 USD
      Airfare : 40~50 KRW
      Hotel reservation : iGEM will propose several hotels in a discount charge
2) assigned part
