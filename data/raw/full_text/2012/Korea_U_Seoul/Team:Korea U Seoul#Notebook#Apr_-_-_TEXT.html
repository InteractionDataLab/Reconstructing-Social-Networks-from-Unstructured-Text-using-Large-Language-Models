Team:Korea U Seoul/Notebook/Apr
From 2012.igem.org
Notebook : April
A. Apr, 16, 2012
1) We had time to share our ideas for brainstorming.
  Sanghoon Han
      Fire alarm using bacteria : Making bacteria detecting CO, H2S, other toxic gases and compounds formed during incomplete combustion. After the detecting, noticeable change occurs (e.g. color change)
     Make bacteria responds to electric field to make a display system
  Byoungnam Min
      Empty cell : Making bacterial factory by modifying bacteria to maintain only cellular structures related to production of certain material we want.
     Walking bacteria : Literally, bacteria that show walking mechanism.
     Salt eating bacteria : Using bacteria in desalination process
     Bacterial feed : Modifying bacteria to produce materials that facilitating growth and mix them with feed.
     Beeping bacteria : Making communication system of bacteria visible to human eyes.
  Kyungjin Kim
     Improved photosynthesis in bacteria : By using obg gene exists in ribosome, enhances bacterial photosynthesis.
     Diagnosis of diseases using bacteria : By expressing lectin proteins on the surface of bacteria that specifically recognize certain oligosaccharides, find out mutant cells
  Haerim Song
     Cyclopropane fatty acids : Producing alkanes by using Brucella abortus
  Jaeho Jang
     Fat degrading bacteria : Literally, modifying bacteria to degrade fat for a diet
     Perfume production using bacteria
     Making shaving cream with bacteria : Modifies bacteria to degrade beard.
     Jean washing : Modifying bacteria to degrade fiber of jean or indigo dye to wash jean.
  Jeongmin Lee
     Heating bacteria : Using bacteria to get warm. Can be used to make boiler.
     Using bacteria to change a circadian rhythm : Clone the gene related to circadian rhythm and use it to overcome jet lag.
  Hyunkee Kim
     Silk production using bacteria : Adopt insect-oriented gene related to silk production to bacteria
     Cellulose degrading bacteria : Literally, by using cellulase gene, make bacteria to degrade cellulose.
  Jihyong Nam
     Hemoglobin in bacteria : Modify bacteria to express different phenotypes according to  oxygen concentration.
     Expressing various colors using bacteria : Use luciferase. By concentration of bacteria that are coated with shells having colors, different colors of lights are emitted.
  Jihoon Jeong
     Water quality measurement device using microorganism : Measuring DO, BOD of water by how much microorganism expressed fluorescence.
     Channel rhodopsin photometer : literally, measure amount of light using channel rhodopsin
     Solar photovoltatic power generation using microorganisms.
     Fertilizer using Agrobacterium species.
     Development of microorganisms that attaches to organic compounds and then precipitate.
  Kyeongwoo Jang
     Microorganism power generator : Using pressure of gases produced by microorganisms, generate power.
     Movement of bacteria using endospore
  Dohoon Kwon
     Make bacteria to sense cholesterol, and then burst to release contained  enzymes that breaks down cholesterol.
     Bacterial detergent : secretion of protease clean up laundry.
2) Things to be considered during brainstorming.
     Ideas related to human body : Since projects for iGEM should be done in 3~6 months, we cannot go through clinical trial. So try to think of other ideas
     For the experiment, we would use prokaryotic cells and yeast cells. Also we can use eukaryote's gene. But since our lab does not deal with eukaryotic cells, try to think of ideas in this boundary.
     Ideas already done by previous iGEMers cannot be used again but it is possible to improve the ideas and they would be approved to use.
3) Brief expected schedule for our team
     Apr : Decide which topic our team's gonna proceed.
     May and June : Develope the idea, design experiment and start coding our wiki page
     During Vacation : do experiment, gathering data and analyze them.
     Sep : Get ready for wiki freeze, prepare poster and presentation files.
     Oct : Final check for Asia jamboree
     Nov : World championship
4) Next meeting
     Apr 30, p.m. 8:00, lecture room 335 Life Science Division West building. (Next week is exam period, therefore, we don't have regular meeting.)
     Develope each one's idea and read some articles related to it if needed. Share the articles by uploading pdf version of them if you searched for some.
B. Apr, 30, 2012
1) 2nd brainstorming
  Dohoon Kwon
      Nitrogen Sensor & fertilizer : Modify bacteria to measure amount of nitrogen in the soil and if the amount is not enough, nitrogen fixation occurs.
  Hyunkee Kim
      Using aldehydes or fatty acids to produce diesel : Using Isobutyryl-CoA as a substrate, adopt enzymes such as FabH2.
     Confirming whether farm produces are organic or not : Make bacteria to detect pesticides or herbicides and if they exist, to produce fluorescence.
     Plastic degrading bacteria
  Kyeongwoo Jang
     Developed previous logic circuit idea - Binary calculator using channel rhodopsin to detect light signal.
  Jihoon Jung
     Concretize previous light recognizing logic circuit idea :
     Input : light   -> Processing : deliver information by simple diffusion
     Output : fluorescent proteins => expressed when recognized certain signals
  Byeongnam Min
     Communication with bacteria : Sensing heat shock or starvation condition of bacteria by using various σ factors. -> making some sort of 'tamagochi'.
  Sanghoon Han
     Adopting absolute configuration : In synthesis of pharmaceutical, products are usually racemic compound. Synthesizing the compound with one absolute configuration by developing in vivo pathway. (e.g. Thalidomide synthesis patent)
     Addition to display system using bacteria : Distribute bacteria in 2D plate by chemotaxis or other methods.
-> Then in response to electric field, bacteria will arrange in certain direction. Light would not pass through compartment where bacteria gathered
=> Black and White LCD
  Jihyong Nam
     hromosome walking : Illuminated DNA molecules producing energy by certain mechanism of movement.
=> By using the idea, design an interesting research.
     Shampoo & Conditioner : Molecular structure of conditioner is similar to that of shampoo except the lack of polar parts. So, the idea is producing shampoo molecule and change it to conditioner in response to certain signal.
     CaCO3 producing bacteria : Another way to fix carbon dioxide.
  Wonuk Lee
     Chitin paint : Modify microorganisms to express chitin coat outside of the cell, and use them as a paint.
2) Created Facebook page and Twitter account.
     Not only our team members but other users of facebook can also visit our 2012 iGEM team site.
     Before we finish coding frame of wiki page, the page would be used to post our notebook info and other contents.
     Facebook page address : http://www.facebook.com/2012iGEM.KU
     Twitter account : http://twitter.com/igem_ku2012
3) Narrowed down candidate ideas for our project.
     During the brainstorming, we've got 38 ideas
     Narrowed down ideas from those that had more than 4 votes at last meeting and ideas from this meeting and chose 12 plausible ideas (that we can actually test in our lab, and also that have not been already tested by others).
     We'll get advise from our instructor and advisors with the chosen ideas. Later on, we'll vote for a final idea for 2012 iGEM project.
     Here's the list of 12 ideas :
Display system using bacteria (in response to electric field)
Heat releasing bacteria
Hemoglobin in bacteria (expressing different phenotypes to O2 concentration)
Logic circuit adopting Channel Rhodopsin
Method to confirm whether products are organic or not (detecting herbicide)
Communication in bacteria (making sort of 'tamagochi')
Nitrogen sensor & fertilizer
Chromosome walking (to produce energy)
Shampoo - conditioner forming bacteria
Chitin paint
Carbon fixation forming CaCO3
