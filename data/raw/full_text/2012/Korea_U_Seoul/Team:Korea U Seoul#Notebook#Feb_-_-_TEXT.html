Presentation Contest
     During February, Sanghoon, Haerim and  Jinsik (one of the 2011 iGEM Korea U Seoulteam members) participated in a presentation competition held by Seoul National University. We made a presentation on synthetic biology, reasoning why we have to invest in this field and reporting the current state of Korea. We mentioned iGEM competition showing that there are increasing interests in synthetic biology area. We made a good result and advanced to the finals.
