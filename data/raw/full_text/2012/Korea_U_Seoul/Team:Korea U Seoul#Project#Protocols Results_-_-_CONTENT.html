We made Ax21 producing <I> E. coli </I> to mimic Xanthomonas oryzae secreting Ax21 protein. In order to find out whether Rice Guardian detects Ax21 and produces mRFP, co-culturing two cell types (Rice Guardian and Ax21 producing <I> E. coli </I>) was conducted. After cell density reaches up to OD<SUB>600</SUB> 1.0, its fluorescence level was measured (data below).

            </P><P>     The data show that when ax21 gene is lost or gene expression is not induced, rax promoter in Rice guardian expresses only basal level of mRFP (2nd, 3rd, and 4th bar). Only when <I> E. coli </I> carrying Ax21 surface-display system properly expresses Ax21, mRFP level in Rice Guardian cells doubles (5th bar). Our result is consistent with natural rax system in <I> Xanthomonas oryzae</I>.

Growth rate of individual cell kind </B></DT><DD><P>     Though initially inoculated at 1:1 ratio, there are possibilities that the growth rate of E. coli cells carrying different plasmids might be different. Also, L-arabinose, which works as an inducer for Ax21 protein expression, may affect the growth rate of each cell kind. We cultured each cell independently with and without arabinose induction, and made each cell's growth curve. Based on this information, we decided the proportin of each cell kind from co-cultured cell mixture.

            </DIV><H4><P id="title">Conclusion : Rice Guardian</P></H4><DD><P>      Since Ax21 detecting process is not revealed completely, we couldn’t guarantee our synthetic <I> E. coli </I> would work as intended. However, through experimental analysis, we found out ColS acts directly on Ax21 protein, and ColRS is all <I> E. coli </I> needs to detect Ax21 outside cell membrane. Even though Rice Guardian we built can only determine the existence of <I> Xanthomonas oryzae </I> at current state, we are planning to upgrade our design to both detect, and kill <I> Xanthomonas oryzae </I>, which eventually matches the title of our project.

            	Binary full adder consists of five logic gates: two XOR gates, two AND gates and one OR gate.
			</P><DIV align="center">Figure 3. Binary full adder
            </DIV><P>     Each logic gate can be expressed as below differential equation being composed of basal expression rate, regulation function and decay rate.
            </P><DIV align="center">Figure 4. Differential equation on synthesis of a protein
            </DIV><P>     where z is protein synthesis rate, α the basal transcription level, α + β the maximum synthesis rate. x and y are each proteins, f(x, y) is the regulation function of gene, and z is the decay rate. To describe transcriptional regulation of protein x and y mathematically, we implemented Hill equation.
            </P><DIV align="center">Figure 5. Hill equation
            </DIV><P>     where f(x) is the probability which the operate is full, K is the Hill constant, l is Hill coefficient. Using above two equations, we constructed regulation functions on each logic gates such as AND, OR and XOR gates.
            </P><DIV align="center">Figure 6. Assemble of Hill equation expressing each logic gate
            </DIV><P>     The following set of constants have been used : K = 0.5 μM, l = 3, α = 0.2 μM·min<SUP>-1</SUP>, β = 1.0 μM·min<SUP>-1</SUP>, μ = 1 min<SUP>-1</SUP>. We solved differential equation on dz/dt to exponential equation on input concentrations of x, y and time t
            </P><DIV align="center">Figure 7. solved differential equation
            </DIV><P>     Using this equation, we calculated the amount of protein with the course of time. Function f(x,y) indicates regulation of gene expression at each logic gate such as AND, OR, XOR gates at input concentration of protein x, y. To plot above equations, we used R which is one of statistical tools. We made two functions reflecting the equations described in figure 1 and 2.
            </P><DIV align="center">Figure 8-1. Gate function
            </DIV><DIV align="center">Figure 8-2. Full.adder function
            </DIV><P>     GATE() function receives four parameters including initial concentrations of x, y, time and type of logic gate such as AND, OR, XOR. The return value is the concentration of expressed protein as a result of transcriptional regulation. Full adder function operates whole binary full adder via 5 logic gates, two XOR gates, two AND gates and one OR gate. Return values are sum and carry as in the electrical logic circuit. To visualize result of Full adder function, we plotted the concentration of expressed protein along with time.
            </P><DIV align="center">Figure 9. The resulting plots in the various conditions
            </DIV><P>     As you can see in the Fig 9, eight possible combinations of three signals (A, B, C) produced different results of sum and carry. The concentration of sum is indicated by red line and that of carry is indicated by blue one.  These graphs fairly reflect the theoretical logic gates. We consider 0.5 as a boundary between on and off of the binary signal.
            </P></DD><H4><P id="title">Conclusion : Binary Full Adder Using Bacterial Logic Gate System</P></H4><DD><P>      In this research, we designed microbial logic gates including AND, OR, XOR and connected them to assemble binary full adder. To acheive this, we considered quorum sensing to trasmit molecular signal and diffusion rates of signal molecules. However, density dependent quorum sensing takes much time to perform experiment becuase of condition of laboratory. Thus, instead of doing experiment, we designed the mathematical model using Hill equation which describes transcriptional regulation of specific gene. We plotted the result of simulation and it succesfully refleced binary full adder. Based on the model, we planned to perform this experimentally for furthur study.
