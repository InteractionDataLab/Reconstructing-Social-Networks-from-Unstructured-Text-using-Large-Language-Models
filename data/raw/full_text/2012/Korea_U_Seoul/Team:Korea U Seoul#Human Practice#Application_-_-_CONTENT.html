An idea which biological component can compute and process data first appeared in 1962. Since then, a number of researches about bio-computing had increased to reach its peak in 2009. Though significant improvement was made, it is still ongoing project and needs support and public interest. Now, bio-computing is subdivided into bio-sensors, databases, bio-informatics, and so on.

1) Cell-based computer development.
Our project, Bacterial Logic Gate, is to design 2 binary full adder by using cellular component. Our team thinks making computer out of biological component is possible in the future. The bacterial calculator is the first one. Although many researches and experiment should be done in order to make cell-based computer, completing 2 bit adder is the starter. 
No one in 1940 believed it was possible for non-organic material to process data. When the computer was invented,it was a revolutionary remark. Like the first computer, ENIAC, took one day to process its data, bacterial calculator may seem useless at this moment. However, sum of these small changes the world. When researches discover more about biology, advancement on bio-computing will be realized.  

2) Application of AND, XOR, OR gate into other area.

Binary full adder is composed of AND, XOR, and OR gate. Each gate is separable and independent from each other. On the other hand, adding each gate is also possible and its alignment leads to different outcome. That is to say, combination of AND, XOR, and OR gate may lead to other application such as Hash function. Hash function is encryption of data and commonly used. Many iGEM teams developed this idea and it was successful. Apart for this, we believe combination AND, XOR, and OR gate can imitate already existing cellular mechanism.

<B> Rice Guardian Application </B>
Recently there are many problems regarding bacterial leaf blight disease(BLB). Bacterial leaf blight, an example of plant disease, is an infamous vascular disease in irrigated rice. This disease can cause up to 50% yield reduction. Bacterial leaf blight in rice is caused by infection of bacteria known as Xanthomonas oryzae KACC10331.
Bacterial leaf blight severely damages agriculture and nation’s economy. BLB is a major concern in countries where the staple food is rice. Bacterial blight is reported to have reduced Asia's annual rice production by as much as 60%. For example, in Japan, about 300,000 to 400,000 hectares of rice were affected by the disease in recent years. There were 20% to 50% yield losses reported in severely infected fields. In Indonesia, losses were higher than those reported in Japan. In India, millions of hectares were severely infected, causing yield losses from 6% to 60%. 
To solve this problem, we performed gene manipulation which can kill Xanthomonas oryzae KACC10331, the causing bacteria of BLB. We designed genetically modified E. coli which can recognize the particles from Xanthomonas oryzae KACC10331and after recognizing them, secreting substance that kills Xanthomonas oryzae KACC10331. By this method, we think we can partially prevent BLB. 

1) Solution for Food Shortage

Eco-friendly
Advantage of Rice Guardian is eco-friendly.Because agricultural chemicals such as pesticide and herbicide aren't used, it doesn’t damage ecosystem. Since agricultural chemicals are bad for human health, the use of Rice Guardian may contribute to longer lifespan. 

Application into other crops
Rice Guardian can be used in variety of crops as well. Xanthomonas species can infect as a wide variety of species including pepper, citrus, cotton, tomato, broccoli, cabbage, and soybeans as well as rice. Rice Guardian can play an important role in reducing the infection of many other crop.
Increase in Crop productivity
Increase in crop production is expected. By killing Xanthomonas oryzae KACC10331, other diseases caused by Xanthomonas genus such as bacterial canker, bacterial shot hole, black rot can be prevented.  Eventually the strongest effect is increasing the crop production . It could be the solution for food shortage.


2) Protecting Endangered Species –Cyperussemifertilis(Sedge)

Cyperus is a large genus of about 600 species of sedges, distributed throughout all continents in both tropical and temperate regions. They are annual or perennial plants, mostly aquatic and growing in still or slow-moving water up to 0.5 m deep. The species vary greatly in size, with small species only 5 cm tall, while others can reach 5 m in height. Common names include papyrus sedges, flatsedges, nutsedges, umbrella-sedges and galingales.
The stems are circular in cross-section in some, triangular in others, usually leafless for most of their length, with the slender grass-like leaves at the base of the plant, and in a whorl at the apex of the flowering stems. The flowers are greenish, and wind pollinated; they are produced in clusters among the apical leaves. The seed is a small nutlet. 
The Scientific Committee, established by the Threatened Species Conservation Act, has made a Final Determination to list the sedgeCyperussemifertilis S.T. Blake as an ENDANGERED SPECIES on Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Act. Listing of Endangered Species is provided for by Part 2 of the Act. 
	Cyperussemifertilis is subspecies of sadge and is also attacked by Xanthomonas oryzae KACC10331. Since it is endangered species, Rice guardian may prevent infection by Xanthomonas oryzae KACC10331. Many other plant species also attacked by Xanthomonas oryzae KACC10331 can be protected.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
