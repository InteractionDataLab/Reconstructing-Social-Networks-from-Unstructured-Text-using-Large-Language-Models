Introduction to iGEM </H3><DL><DD>
- About synthetic biology : As an automobile can be described as assembly of numerous parts, synthetic biology is a field of assembled techniques from division of biotechnology. One of benefits offered in this field is that we can use necessary parts with lack of knowledge to specifics of each technique.

- Look around 2011 iGEM teams' posters, wiki pages.
</DD><H3> 2. Briefly decided role of each member (Doesn't mean working on the role only. What to focus)</H3><DD>
- Web design team (Wiki team) - Coding wiki pages and making video clips and flash movie.

: Sanghoon Han, Kyengwoo Jang, Jihoon Jeong, Jihyong Nam

- Fundraising team - Literally, fundraising. Contact with local community, bio-tech companies and etc for fundraising.
: Dohoon Kwon, Wonuk Lee
</DD><H3> 3. Preparation for brainstorming </H3><DD>
- Since it's the beginning, think of rough idea, not the specific model or design including principles of how idea works out. (e.g. drawing pictures with bacteria, bacteria extracting rare earth resources)

- Refer to iGEM website. There are some projects suggested by sponsors.
</DD><H3> 4. Communication info and decided regular meeting. </H3><P><DD>
- Facebook page, Twitter, Naver cafe (Korean page. <A href="http://cafe.naver.com/2012igem"> http://cafe.naver.com/2012igem </A>)

- Ideas related to human body : Since projects for iGEM should be done in 3~6 months, we cannot go through clinical trial. So try to think of other ideas

- For the experiment, we would use prokaryotic cells and yeast cells. Also we can use eukaryote's gene. But since our lab does not deal with eukaryotic cells, try to think of ideas in this boundary.

- Ideas already done by previous iGEMers cannot be used again but it is possible to improve the ideas and they would be approved to use.
