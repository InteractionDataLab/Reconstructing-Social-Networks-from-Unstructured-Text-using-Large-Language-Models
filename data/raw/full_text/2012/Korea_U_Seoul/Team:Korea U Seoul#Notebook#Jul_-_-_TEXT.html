Team:Korea U Seoul/Notebook/Jul
From 2012.igem.org
Notebook : July
A. July, 4, 2012
Today’s meeting was basically about logic gate using plasmid and molecular beacon.
1) Idea development
  Hyunkee Kim, Kyeongwoo Jang, Sanghoon Han, Jihoon Jung
     Limitation: since input and output signal are identical, it is possible for input signal to diffuse into next logic gate.
     Solution: Degradation of input signal before diffusing to next logic gate is required.
     9 plasmids are needed for full adder.
  Jeongmin Lee, Kyeongjin Kim, Wonuk Lee: DNA logic gate
      As DNA gets longer, DNA synthesis is expensive and even more when protein is attached to DNA
      Numerous of companies can make florescence DNA
      MIDLAND, for example, can make DNA segment; $2.6 per base pair and $325 for protein attachment
  Back up idea team ( Jihyong Nam, Byeongnam Min,  Haerim Song, Dohoon Kwon)
     Microbacterial “Damagochi” : using sigma factor, bacteria can ‘express’ their current condition: developed idea based on brainstorming session
     For example       Sigma32 : heat shock (approximately 42degree)
      Sigma38 : starvation or stationary phase
2) Next meeting
     Professor is on seminar this week, so our meeting with professor is delayed.
     Further research and development of idea
     logic gate based on plasmid: . Hyunkee Kim, Kyeongwoo Jang, Sanghoon Han, Jihoon Jung
     logic gate based on DNA: Jeongmin Lee, Kyeongjin Kim
     back up idea: Jihyong Nam, Byeongnam Min,  Haerim Song, Dohoon Kwon Kim
     Each team should submit one ppt files
B. July 11, 2012
1) Important announcement
  Jeongmin Lee, Kyeongjin Kim: DNA logic gate
      We had discussed with professor Choi, and he said that DNA logic gate is hard project. He added this project is not ingenious at al
      Thus, we had time to think about other topics in the meetings
2) Brainstorming and discussion on new idea
     Jihoon Jung: Expiration date bacteria: when dairy food is no longer good, bacteria which are attached to the product as a form of sticker will emit florescence
     This idea is similar to bacteria timer. This idea is creative in a way that it also considers temperature and time. When temperature is up, growth of bacteria is stimulated and florescence will be synthesized faster and vice versa
     Further research and development of idea & new team allocation
3) Next meeting
     Wiki team: Byeongnam Min, Kyeongwoo Jang, Sanghoon Han
     Sponsor team: Jeongmin Lee, Kyeongjin Kim, Jihyong Nam,  Haerim Song
     Human practice: Byeongnam Min
     Lab team: Hyunkee Kim, Kyeongwoo Jang, Sanghoon Han, Jihoon Jung
C. July 25, 2012
1) Topic decided: detection and killing of Xanthomonas oryzae using quorum sensing of AX 21
      Xanthomonas oryzae is pathogen which affects rice. In fact, Korea is the first country to sequence the genome of this pathogen due to its devastating effects on agriculture.
      This bacteria primary use small AvrXa21 protein as a communication chemical
      1. raxA, raxB, raxC, raxST are genes that synthesize proteins which are used for secrete AvrXa21
      2. raxH, raxR are used for sensing AvrXa21
      3. raxP, raxQ produce AvrXa21
      We will use raxH, and raxR which detect AvrXa21 for cloning. When it detects AvrXa21 it will synthesize florescence
      Once we are successful, we will replace bacteriocin instead of florescence.
      We need AvrXa21 to run some tests. Since it is difficult to colonize Xanthomonas oryzae, we are planning to synthesize AvrXa21 chemically. On the other hand it is difficult to put sulfur to the protein, so we need to research more about that
      Which promoter is responsible for binding with raxR output (TF) is unknown For cloning, EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, PstI site should be excluded in genes, RaxRH has EcoRI, PstI restriction enzyme site, so we need mutant gene
2) Human practice
     Synthetic biology presentation on February
     Review article submit: BT news
     CCP
     Highschool student iGEM collaboration
     KAIST Team collaboration
3) Next meeting
     Does it work without surfur attached toAvrXa21 : everyone
     promoter used for AvrXa21: everyone
     (optional) a way to selectively kill Xanthomonas oryzae
     A way to colonize Xanthomonas : Sanghoon Han
     Science camp presentation:  Haerim Song
     Report for Sponsor: Jeongmin Lee, Kyeongjin Kim, Jihyong Nam,  Haerim Song
     Wiki team: Byeongnam Min, Kyeongwoo Jang, Sanghoon Han
