From 2012.igem.org
Recruiting team members for 2012 iGEM.
- Nothing special events had happened during March except recruiting team members for 2012 iGEM.
- Haerim Song and Sanghoon Han contributed to the recruiting.
- Poster, online announcement posted on both official website and web community of Korea University, and video clip introducing activities for preparing iGEM jamboree were made and used in recruiting process.
- As necessity of a linkage between formal participants and future participants of iGEM raises, we started planning to make a club for iGEM alumni in Korea University.
