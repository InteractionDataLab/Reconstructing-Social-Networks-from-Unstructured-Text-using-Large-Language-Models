Notebook : March
A. Mar 28, 2012
1) Introduction to iGEM
      About synthetic biology : As an automobile can be described as assembly of numerous parts, synthetic biology is a field of assembled techniques from division of biotechnology. One of benefits offered in this field is that we can use necessary parts with lack of knowledge to specifics of each technique.
     Look around 2011 iGEM teams' posters, wiki pages.
2) Briefly decided role of each member (Doesn't mean working on the role only. What to focus)
     Web design team (Wiki team) - Coding wiki pages and making video clips and flash movie: Sanghoon Han, Byeongnam Min, Kyengwoo Jang
     Design team - Dealing with Adobe photoshop, Illustrator to design most things except video clips and flash movie. Making poster and presentation files for the jamboree: Haerim song, Jeongmin Lee, Kyengwoo Jang, Byeongnam Min, Jihoon Jeong, Kyungjin Kim
     Human practice team - Dealing with human practice activities such as introducing synthetic biology, contact with other teams for collaboration, think of future application, and extra: Sanghoon Han, Kyengwoo Jang, Jihoon Jeong, Jihyong Nam
     Fundraising team - Literally, fundraising. Contact with local community, bio-tech companies and etc for fundraising: Dohoon Kwon, Wonuk Lee
3) Preparation for brainstorming
     Since it's the beginning, think of rough idea, not the specific model or design including principles of how idea works out. (e.g. drawing pictures with bacteria, bacteria extracting rare earth resources)
     Refer to iGEM website. There are some projects suggested by sponsors.
4) Communication info and decided regular meeting.
     Facebook page, Twitter, Naver cafe (Korean page. http://cafe.naver.com/2012igem)
     Regular meeting on every Monday, p.m. 8:00, lecture room 335 Life Science Division West building (except Midterm and Final exam period)
5) Consideration about making club
     This year, we are planning to make a club for Korea U Seoul iGEM team to enhance communication between former participants and future participants and to share experience.
     The club would be under Division of Life Science, Korea University if made.
6) Things we have to do until next Monday
     Bring at least one plausible ideas for brainstorming in ppt file about 1~2 slides and upload it to website.
     Look around former iGEM prize winners' projects
