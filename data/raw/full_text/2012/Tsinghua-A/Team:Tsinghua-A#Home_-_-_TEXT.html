'Life' is too big a word, especially when we are talking about synthetic biology, but we still find it interesting, in our life, when everyone meets alternatives and makes his decisions, that colorful behaviors and lifestyles just differentiate from small left-or-right choices, and that widely-differed ones make up a well-operated society. This year our study will be concentrated on controllable choice-making E. Coli, with left-or-right directions of gene expression to be determined, thus to realize the life-like differentiation and dedifferentiation, and synthesized function of the cell 'teamwork'. That's the idea why we named our project after 'E. CoLIFE'. readmore
