Team:Johns Hopkins-Software/Collaboration
From 2012.igem.org
Collaboration: Johns Hopkins University Wetware Team
We primarily helped the Wetware team in two ways. Firstly, we helped make our software available for their use. Secondly, from time to time, we annotated plasmids that they needed. What follows are screenshots of examples of these plasmids that they wanted us to annotate for them. They used these plasmids for various reasons throughout their investigations.
IXR BAC:  
CIB2:  
CRY2:  
Collaboration: Dalton High School
We also helped the Dalton High School team to mine 30 yeast promoter parts from the yeast genome. The exact promoters are:
