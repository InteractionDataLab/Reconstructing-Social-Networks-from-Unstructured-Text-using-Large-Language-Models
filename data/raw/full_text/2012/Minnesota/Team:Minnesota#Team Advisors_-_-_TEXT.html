Dr. Jeff Gralnick The Gralnick lab is interested in understanding the physiology of Shewanella, a species of gram-negative bacteria found throughout the world in aquatic environments. By understanding the mechanistic details of processes in S. oneidensis, it becomes possible to rationally engineer S. oneidensis (and its relatives) for biotechnological applications, ranging from bioremediation to energy generation to biocatalysis.
Dr. Claudia Shmidt-Dannert Claudia Schmidt-Dannert is interested in microorganisms and plants that naturally synthesize a diversity of chemical compounds useful as drugs, new biomaterials and in food applications.
