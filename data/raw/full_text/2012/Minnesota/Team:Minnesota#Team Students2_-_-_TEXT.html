Hannah Aho Hannah has a BS in Genetics, Cell Biology and Development and is working towards a BA in French. She plans to attend medical school to become a urogynecologist. Her interests include Islamic feminist literature (especially from Algeria), sexual health education, le Fantastique, Korean cinema, listening to music, and watching old zombie movies. She consumes caffeine in the form of coffee (hot or iced) with heavy cream. She protects herself from the sun by wearing SPF 60 sunscreen every day, rain or shine. Her TV character alter ego: Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation.
George Chao George is double majoring in Genetics, Cell Biology and Development and Computer Science. He plans to attend graduate school, and hopefully direct a lab in the future. His interests include ballroom dance, food, programming, video games, rollerblading, and biking. If he needs a caffeine boost George will drink an iced mocha with no whipped cream or an energy drink (NOS and Rockstar Black Citrus being his personal favorites). To protect himself from the sun he stays indoors (he’s a researcher, what do you expect?). His movie character alter ego: Harold Crick from Stranger than Fiction.
Maria Filsinger Maria is a high school student interested in Bioengineering and Biology, both of which she plans to study at Stanford University this fall. She would eventually like to attend graduate school. Her interests include horseback riding and volunteering to tutor students in at-risk neighborhoods in Minneapolis. Her favorite way to consume caffeine is in the form of chocolate and she uses SPF 15 to protect herself from the sun. Her movie character alter ego: Mulan.

His interests include fishing, playing and watching sports, reading, and learning about nerdy things. If he needs a caffeine boost, he can be seen enjoying a vanilla iced latté. To protect himself from the sun he uses green cellophane as he is allergic to most kinds of sunscreen. His TV character alter ego: The Janitor from Scrubs.
