We focused our outreach efforts this year on informing the general public and on determining public perception and understanding of the field of synthetic biology. In order to reach as many and as broad a membership of the community as possible, we spent three days at the Minnesota State Fair, one of the largest state fairs in the U.S. In order to understand public opinion, we designed a survey that was distributed at the fair and through various University of Minnesota classes. We also helped other iGEM teams, such at TU_Munich, by filling out their surveys! Please click on the images below to learn more!
