David obtained his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and his Ph.D. in Chemical, Biochemical and Environmental Engineering from Rutgers University. He is a postdoc at the University of Minnesota's Biotechnology Institute and plans to do something with his life someday. David is obsessed with good food, Canadian whiskey, and political news. He is passionate about skiing, traveling, and ranting about republicans. David gets his caffeine from numerous cups of coffee throughout the day. He avoids the sun preferring to hang in the shade, but will use ample sunscreen when venturing out.  His TV alter ego: Brian Griffin from Family Guy.
</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Sarah Bloch</B>
Sarah is a PhD student in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics who hopes to use her synthetic biology experience to land a career in industry.  She loves to spend her time cooking, reading or playing with her puppy Buster.  She prefers cold caffeinated beverages - an iced coffee in the morning and diet soda with lunch.  Being a grad student, she spends most of her time indoors slaving away at the lab bench... but when the occasion arises, she uses sunscreen or well-covering clothing to block UV rays.  Her TV character alter ego: Liz Lemon from 30 Rock.
</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Mark Held</B>
Mark received his PhD in plant genetics from the University of Western Ontario, in Canada and is currently working as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Minnesota.  If he’s not in the lab, he enjoys cooking, gardening, fly-fishing and of course playing hockey during the winter as any good Canuck would.  Mark’s tanning regime generally involves developing a really bad farmer’s tan early in the summer, which gets progressively worse throughout the year.  His TV alter ego: Randy Marsh from South Park.
</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Dana Morrone</B>
Dana holds a PhD in biochemistry and his future goals are in the fields of agricultural biotechnology and science policy. His interests include reading, traveling, building furniture and global domination through enzyme kinetics. He does not drink caffeinated drinks, this is not due to religious reasons, but because he would be awake all night. He doesn't really use sunscreen because he's not a fan of the beach and usually ends up swimming only at night if he's had any caffeine. Charlie Townsend is his TV alter-ego.
</TD></TR><TR><TD><B>Grayson Wawrzyn</B>
Grayson is a PhD candidate in the Schmidt-Dannert lab.  He s entering the final year of study before completion of his thesis work.  After graduation he plans to looks for positions in industry or a postdoctoral research position in a lab specializing in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.  His interests include video games, music, soccer, running, and spending time with his golden retriever, Allie.  Grayson's dose of caffeine comes in the form of a single cup of strong coffee first thing in the morning, and the occasional diet coke with lunch.  He uses sunscreen less frequently than he should, often burning and applying copious amounts of aloe to prevent peeling.  His TV character alter ego:  Ted Mosby from How I Met Your Mother.
