Improvements and testing of existing biobricks
BBa_K283030 and BBa_I712074
We have placed an T7 promoter BBa_I712074 upstream of the RBS-cheZ BBa_K283030 system making it a functional biobrick for inducible expression in an E. coli host harboring the lambda DE3 lysogen.  We have tested this biobrick for functionality and confirmed that it works as expected.
BBa_K398108
Based on the data displayed here , we have determined the conditions in which bacteria display the most tumbling. Tumbling is a  chemotactic  response to environmental conditions that signifies a positive bacterial response. At a salt concentration of 0.5 M, an average of ~10% of bacteria were consistently tumbling. There is a clear bell-curve trend of induced tumbling in E. coli that contain the BBa_K398108 salt resistance with optimal conditions at 0.5M NaCl.
This is a congruent with the data found by the TU Delft iGEM 2010 team. A peak growth rate can be observed at 0.5 M NaCl, signifying positive cellular conditions. Our data also suggests optimal NaCl/environmental conditions at this concentration.
