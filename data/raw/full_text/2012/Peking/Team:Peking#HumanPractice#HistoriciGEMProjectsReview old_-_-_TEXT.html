Summary
Sharing and learning from each other is one of the most important features of the iGEM competition, in that any lack of experience could be well ameliorated by studying the projects and the way of presenting them of other and/or previous teams.
We here present you with a collection and praise of historic iGEM projects. Though these projects selected may not comprehensively include all the meritorious projects of each aspect, we managed to introduce you some representative projects from different perspective. And we hope this collection might help iGEMers with their projects and presentations.
5 Meritorious Projects: Modeling
The first amazing modeling project for you is from Peking 2010 team. As they were endeavoring in the development of a sensing circuit for heavy metals, the linear range should be broad enough to include a change of several magnitudes. Taking an informative Biological Network Reverse Engineering approach to guide the circuit design, they were finally able to enhance the function to a next level.
