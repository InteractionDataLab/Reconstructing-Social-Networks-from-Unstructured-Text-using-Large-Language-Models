Summary
We have done a remarkable job motivating high school students to study Synthetic Biology, and guiding them towards future participation in the iGEM HS-Division.
Motivation
Synthetic Biology possesses enormous potential of application to boost a nation's economy and improve people's lives, as well as enhance people's understanding of the origin of life. As an emerging field combining conventional Biology with physical sciences and engineering principles, Synthetic Biology calls for more lively and intelligent young men to generate ideas with considerable potential. That is the motivation of Peking iGEM team's human practice this year, "Sowing Tomorrow Synthetic Biologists". Based on the goal, we desire to motivate high school students to study Synthetic Biology and guide them towards future participation in the iGEM high school division.
Achievement
1. We briefly made a survey about iGEM-HS in Beijing and went to The Second High School attached to Beijing Normal University (SHSBNU) to know more about students.
2. We formed an ally with Beijing Teenageer Science & Technology Club (BTSTC), in order to make our Human Practice project a long-term plan, as well as to propagate for the lecture we intented to present to high school students.
3. In mid-July we gave a series of lectures "Life as Machines --- Rational Design for Artificial Biological Systems", to Beijing high school students, introducing SB and iGEM, and motivating them to particiate in iGEM HS-Division contest.
4. We analyzed the questionaires the students filled after the lectures, obtained crucial information about their opinions and intention, and then made it clear what we should do next.
5. Guided by the questionaire, we wrote a report to apply for a specific funding for iGEM-HS in Beijing and began to guide three students from the SHSBNU towards their future participation in iGEM competition.
