Optogenetic tools have made significant impact on life sciences and beyond. However, several serious issues remain: cytotoxicy, narrow dynamic range, and dependency on laser and exogenous chromophore. To circumvent these, Peking iGEM has rationally constructed a hypersensitive sensor of luminance- Luminesensor. Primarily, the sensor was designed by fusing blue-light-sensing protein domain from Neurospora with DNA binding domain of LexA from E.coli, following which protein structure inspection and kinetic simulation were conducted to rationally perform optimization. Amazingly, Luminesensor was proved to be as sensitive as to sense natural light and even bioluminescence. With this sensor, spatiotemporal control of cellular behavior, such as phototaxis, high-resolution 2-D and 3-D bio-printing using dim light and even luminescence of iPad were shown to be very easy. What’s more, we successfully implemented cell-cell signaling using light, which is the very first time in synthetic biology and of great importance for biotechnological use.
/*During the last few decades, chemically regulated genetic systems have been thoroughly developed and analyzed. Though remarkable endeavors were made towards this issue, the disadvantages of chemical regulation remain: the high cost of chemical synthesis, the diffusion limits, the insecurity and the limited choices of chemicals.
Light, in contrast, is more controllable to regulate molecular and cellular behavior. However, most optogenetics methods rely on laser, which limits their field application.
This summer, Peking iGEM is endeavoring on developing a new ultra-sensitive luminescence sensor and has programmed cells to talk through light.*/
