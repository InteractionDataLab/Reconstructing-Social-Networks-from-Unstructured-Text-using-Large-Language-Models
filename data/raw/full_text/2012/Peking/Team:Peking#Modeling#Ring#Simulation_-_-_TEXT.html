ODE Model
According to the previous circuit and ODE model, we listed all the differential equations and simulated this system in MATLAB with equations listed as below:
We applied the inverse square law to describe the light intensity distribution on the plate according to different radius, with a central intensity I0 in a region of r=1mm. Here, parameters are:

The simulation results in static state are shown below:
Figure 1. ODE Simulation in a plate of the ring-like pattern formation.
Figure 2. ODE Simulation for the radial expression amplitude of the ring-like pattern formation.
From the Figure 1 & 2 above, we discover that, with wildtype parameters, ring-like pattern is formed based on sender-receiver communication through bio-luminescence.
Parameter Analysis
After modeling the ring-like pattern formation with wildtype parameters, we attempted to optimize it in a rational way. We have tuned the parameters both up and down, one by one, and finally discovered several parameters which predominantly influence the expression intensity, ring radius, and band width of pattern formation.

Description
Remark
αG/γG
If increasing, the expression intensity will be amplified, but the ring radius and the band width will not change.
Related to the production and dissociation of GFP
The production rate of GFP is easily tuned.
αC/(θC*γC)
If increasing, the expression intensity will increase, but the ring radius will decease and the band width will not change.
Related to the production and dissociation of CI
The production rate of CI is easily tuned
(k*I0)/(θR*K)
If increasing, the ring radius and the band width will increase, leaving the expression amplitude unchanged.
Related to the light intensity emitted by sender cells and the activation rate, light sensitivity, and binding efficiency of Luminesensor.
Light intensity could be tuned, although the effect may noe be obvious experimentally.
LacI and LacIM1 related parameters
Tend to influence all three criteria.
Related to the production and dissociation rate and binding efficiency of LacI and LaciM1.
Tuning is not useful to make a better pattern.
As we can see, αG/γG, αC/(θC*γC), and (k*I0)/(θR*K) are the most important and accessible parameters for pattern formation. To make it clear, we tuned several of the parameters each in one of the three groups to see the effect on pattern formation, while holding other parameters unchanged.
Firstly, we tuned αG, the production rate of GFP:
Figure 3. Ring Pattern Simulation for αG=1x10-6M/min.
Figure 4. Ring Pattern Simulation for αG=2x10-6M/min.
Figure 5. Ring Pattern Simulation for αG=4x10-6M/min.
Then, we tuned αC, the production rate of CI:
Figure 6. Ring Pattern Simulation for αC=0.2x10-6M/min.
Figure 7. Ring Pattern Simulation for αC=2x10-6M/min.
Figure 8. Ring Pattern Simulation for αC=20x10-6M/min.
Ultimately, we tuned I0/K, the ratio of central light intensity to the sensitivity of Luminesensor:
Figure 9. Ring Pattern Simulation for I0/K=1x10-2M/min.
Figure 10. Ring Pattern Simulation for I0/K=1x10-1M/min.
