Summary
With the spirit of communication and cooperation, Peking 2012 iGEM team members organized several team communication activities, among which are the visiting to Team ZJU and Team OUC-China. We seriously discussed our projects and what we were doing on human practices.
Visiting Team ZJU
Peking iGEM team and ZJU iGEM team have traditionally been in tight connection. Since Peking is the 1st runner-up in 2010, and ZJU is the 2nd runner-up in 2011, both of the two outstanding teams know that we could learn a lot from each other's experience and improve the ideas and designs of both team through the free discussion. Therefore, on July 27th, 7 members of Peking 2012 iGEM team launched the 3-day journey to Hangzhou, the most beautiful city in China, and launched the open communication with ZJU 2012 iGEM team.

After our arrival, we were invited to go to the restaurant near Zhejiang University for some food and drinks and had a nice chat with the ZJU 2012 team members and the leader of ZJU 2011 team.

On the following day, we went to the laboratory of ZJU 2012 team. Both teams got the chance to introduce their team members, give a presentation of the project they were working on. After discussing our projects, we began to introduce the theme of our human practice.

In fact, before our arrival, we thought to work together on a project of Human Practice, addressing lectures related to iGEM and synthetic biology to high school students in Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum, as a continuation and expansion of our HP project Sowing Tomorrow Synthetic Biologists . We provided event planning and contacted with the person in charge of museum, ZJU designed and printed the post and tried to contact with teachers of several high schools in Hangzhou. However, due to summer holidays, it was difficult to call together high school students. At last, we had to give up this collaboration. However, we still motivated members of ZJU iGEM to continue propagating Synthetic Biology to high school students in Hangzhou. In fact, they did a good job after we came back to Beijing!

Visiting Team OUC-China
Our exchange of ideas with ZJU was very helpful to us, and we thought it would be a good idea to organize another outreach communication. From July 28th to 30th, the other team members went to Qingdao and had a serious discussion with Team OUC-China on projects and human practice.
