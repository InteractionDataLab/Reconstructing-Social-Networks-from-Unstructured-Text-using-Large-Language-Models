Summary
With the spirit of communication and cooperation, our team members organized several team communication activities, among which are the visiting to Team ZJU-China and Team OUC-China . While we were visiting these other teams, we discussed our projects on a serious, in depth level, as well described our human practice projects in detail.
Visiting Team ZJU-China
Our team and ZJU iGEM team have traditionally been closely acquainted. Since Peking was the 1st runner-up in 2010, and ZJU was the 2nd runner-up in 2011, both of the two outstanding teams know that we can learn a lot from each other's experience, and improve the ideas and designs of both team through the free discussion. Therefore, on July 27th, 7 members of our team launched the 3-day journey to Hangzhou, the most beautiful city in China, and launched the open communication with ZJU-China 2012 iGEM team.

After our arrival, we were invited to go to the restaurant near Zhejiang University for some food and drinks and had a nice chat with the ZJU 2012 team members and the leader of ZJU 2011 team.
On the following day, we went to the laboratory of ZJU 2012 team. Both teams had the chance to introduce their team members, and give a presentation of their project. After discussing our projects, we began to introduce the theme of our human practice.

In fact, before our arrival, we thought to work together on a project of human practice, addressing lectures related to iGEM and synthetic biology to high school students in Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum, as a continuation and expansion of our HP project Sowing Tomorrow's Synthetic Biologists . We provided event planning and contacted with the person in charge of museum, ZJU designed and printed the post and tried to contact with teachers of several high schools in Hangzhou. However, due to summer holidays, it was difficult to call together high school students. Unfortunately, in the end we had to give up this collaboration. However, we still motivated members of ZJU iGEM to continue propagating Synthetic Biology to high school students in Hangzhou.

Visiting Team OUC-China
Our exchange of ideas with ZJU was very helpful to us, and we thought it would be a good idea to organize another outreach communication. From July 28th to 30th, the other team members went to Qingdao and had an in-depth discussion with Team OUC-China regarding our projects and human practice ideas.
