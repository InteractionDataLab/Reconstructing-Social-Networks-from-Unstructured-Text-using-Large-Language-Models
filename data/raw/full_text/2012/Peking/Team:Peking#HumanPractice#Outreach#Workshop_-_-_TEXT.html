Summary
On July 25th to 29th, the Center for Quantitative Biology in Peking University and Center for System & Synthetic Biology in UCSF co-organized a challenge workshop among undergraduate, graduate, and post-doc students. Our teams (from both the past and present) put up three posters and introduced our projects to other participants and professors. We also discussed with other participants regarding their projects.
PKU-UCSF Workshop
On July 25th to 29th, the Center of Quantitative Biology in Peking University and Center for System & Synthetic Biology in UCSF co-organized a challenge workshop among undergraduate, graduate, and post-doc students. Participants were divided into several teams discussing synthetic biological issues such as optogenetic, micro-fluids, cell stress management, and cell size control. "The teams went through successive rounds of brainstorming, research and discussion, and then presented their ideas daily to the other teams for further critique and redirection" ( "Center Organizes Team Challenge Workshop with Peking University" ).

On July 25th, Our team participated in the PKU-UCSF Workshop. We put up three posters, and introduced our project in depth with anyone that was interested, and got a lot of interesting and constructive feedback from various people. We also had the opportunity to discuss our project with Director Connie M. Lee from UCSF. Her insight and advice benefited our project greatly.

On July 26th, Ms. Lee, the Science Director of Beijing No.4 High School came to visit us. We invited her to come to the PKU-UCSF workshop to get a feel for the atmosphere and experience some of the brainstorming process and scientific discussions. See Guidance & Funding Application .
