Attributions
LIU Jintan is the team leader of Peking-ECUST 2012 iGEM team. His efforts were mainly focused on the administrative affairs and travel arrangement. He also explored the possibility of inter-species light communication between E. coli and mammalian cells.
XIONG Hongyu is the deputy captain of the Peking-ECUST 2012 iGEM team. As a member in the modeling group, he made great attribution to the design of Ring Pattern Formation, the optimization of the Luminesensor, and the simulation of Phototaxis. He also conducted the excellent human practice program this summer.
ZHANG Hong is the deputy captain of Peking-ECUST 2012 iGEM team. He focused on the laboratory management and confirmed the model-based optimization through experiments. He was also responsible for the data page of our biobricks.
YU Zhou is the lab manager of the Peking-EUCST iGEM Laboratory this summer. He focused on the construction of our basic BioBricks. He was also in charge of the presentation of the Luminesensor design and characterization.
XING Wenmin is the financial manager of the team. She was responsible for all financial affairs and travel arrangements. She also contributed to the construction of the CheZ parts and the experimentation of the Phototaxis sub-project.
LI Dayi focused on the construction of light-repressible reporters and measuring the sensitivity of the Luminesensor. He also took part in the human practice program.
LI Hanxi did the most work regarding 2D bio-printing, iPrinting and 3D bio-printing. He exercised his talents on the de novo development of bioprinting devices and the creation of delicate masks for bioprinting.
LU Tian made the effort in the construction of the CheZ parts and experimentation of the Phototaxis sub-project. He was also in charge of the presentation of the Light Communication and Syn Bio in 2D & 3D sub-projects.
QIU Zhen made her efforts in the confirmation of the orthogonality of the Luminesensor with the hosts system. She also participated in the improvements of Luxbrick based on the work of iGEM Cambridge 2010 team.
SUN Sibai is a member of the modeling group in this team and he greatly attributed to the modeling of the Luminesensor optimization and Phototaxis. He wrote a simulation platform with results in 3D viewing. He was also responsible for the Wiki construction and maintenance.
Tina Chen explored the possibility of inter-species light communication between S. cerevisiae and E. coli cells. She was also in charge of the presentation of project summary, future perspective and human practice.
YAN Jiawei was in charge of the construction of basic devices. He constructed the light-repressible LacZ reporter in order to explore the possibility of quantitative characterization of Luminesensor using Miller assay.
YANG Lu was the designer of our logo, wiki, poster, PPT template, booklet and team shirts. She also conducted the post-processing for datagrams and photos in our wiki and PPT.
YU Ye participated in the brainstorming and discussion of project design. He was also responsible for the travel arrangements and visa affairs.
ZHANG Zidong contributed to the basic characterization of the Luminesensor. He confirmed the results of Luxbrick from iGEM Cambridge 2010 team and participated in the experimentation of Light-Communication sub-project.
CHEN Xianjun designed the lightoff system. He spent most of his time establishing the lightoff system. At the beginning, the original model did not work as expected. He made many efforts to optimize it, finally he succeeded.
MA Zhengcai did much work on high-throughput screening in optimization of the lightoff system.
LIU Renmei constructed many plasmids and detected their effects to obtain the lightoff system working as expected.
