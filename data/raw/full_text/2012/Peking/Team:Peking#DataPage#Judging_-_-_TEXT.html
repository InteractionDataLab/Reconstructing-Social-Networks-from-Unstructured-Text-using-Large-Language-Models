Achievements
We are very proud of our many achievements from this summer. Here is a compilation of our feats!
1. We collaborated with a lab and helped 4 other iGEM teams by sharing DNA materials, characterizing their parts and modeling! Click Here .
2. We outlined in detail a new approach of human pratice called "Sowing Tomorrow's Synthetic Biologists"! Click Here .
3. We presented all fresh iGEMers with a collection and praise of historic iGEM projects to share and learn from each other! Click Here .
4. We submitted 11 high quality and well-characterized standard biobricks! Click Here .
5. We improved the ease-of-use of "Lux Brick" that primarily constructed by Cambridge iGEM 2010 and carefully characterized its dynamics of functionality! Click Here or MainPage .
6. We successfully implemented spatiotemporal control of cellular behavior, such as high-resolution 2D and 3D bio-printing using dim light, and even utilizing the luminescence of an iPad! Click Here and Here .
7. We successfully implemented cell-cell communication using  bioluminescence for the very first time in synthetic biology! Here .
Therefore, we believe that we deserve a Gold Medal Prize.
