Expression
Description
Remark
rb = 1 - [DL]/[DT]
This indicates the repressing degree.
DT indicates the total specific binding sites, while the DL indicates the free ones among DT.
rd = 2[LA2X]/[LT]
This indicates the dimerizing degree.
LT indicates the total Luminesensor molecules, and LA2X indicates all dimered Luminesensor molecules, i.e. LA2 + LA2DL.
ra =
( [LAX] + 2[LA2X] ) /[LT]
This indicates the activating degree.
LAX indicates all monomer Luminesensor molecules, i.e. LA + LADL.
The simulation result is shown below:
Figure 1. ODE Simulation Result of the prototype Luminesensor.
From the Figure 1 above, we discovered that the activation and decay of Luminesensor are the key points of progress, and the activating rate is the most sensitive to light intensity. The promoter will be repressed even though the Luminesensor does not totally dimerized.
Stochastic Simulation
In order to verify the robustness of Luminesensor function, we simulated this reaction network with a stochastic model. By estimating the volume of a cell, we converted the concentration of a component into the number of molecules by 1 n mol/L : 1. The results are shown below:
Figure 2. Stochastic Simulation Result of Prototype Luminesensor.
According to Figure 2 above, noise does not influence this system. Thus the Luminesensor is expected to work theoretically. Besides, the average value of stochastic simulation is consistent with the result of ODE model, which in turn proves the self-consistency of our ODE model.
Simulation for GFP Expression
Regulated by the Luminesensor
In order to see whether our model is predictive for the downstream gene expression under control of the Luminesensor, transcription and translation process were incorporated into the modeling of DNA binding process. In addition, we considered the delay of translation initiation time and the growth of cell. The simulation below(Figure 3) represents the GFP expression regulated by the Luminesensor. After a long time in light condition, where GFP expression is inhibited, from t=0h, the cells are moved into dark and begin to express GFP. The GFP expression level varying with time was recorded in this simulation.
Figure 3. ODE Simulation Result is correspond to the experiment data of GFP expression level according to time from, which suggests that our model is effective to present the experiment situation.
