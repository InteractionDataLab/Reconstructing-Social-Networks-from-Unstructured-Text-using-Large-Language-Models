Introduction
Optogenetics has a vital advantage that causes it to have a more imperative spot compared with conventional synthetic biology, which based on chemicals in the future of science. Based on light, the information transmits with a high resolution on the spatiotemporal scale, which make detailed work possible.
Previously, due to the low sensitivity of biosensors,the main light source for optogenetics in prior studies was the laser, which came with the danger of causing cell damage due to the high energy waves. With a higher resolution as well as higher sensitivity, we created the Luminesensor, a valuable compensation for optogenetics, which may make optogenetics in synthetic biology applications no longer a far-off dream.
Bio-printing is a method that guides a group of cells to response to signals in a highly organised way, which may lay a profound foundation in medical and industrial application (e.g. artificial organ and bio-materials). Detailed printing with living cells requires high spatial resolution, which is difficult to realize with chemicals due to diffusion.
However, with the Luminesensor, we managed printing with high resolution in 2D and even 3D with the luminance in the moon-light scale, we even managed in detailed printing with the luminance of an iPad, which suggests that it is not only the first artificially designed sensor that responds to the natural light, but also could act as interface between common electrical devices and biological systems.
