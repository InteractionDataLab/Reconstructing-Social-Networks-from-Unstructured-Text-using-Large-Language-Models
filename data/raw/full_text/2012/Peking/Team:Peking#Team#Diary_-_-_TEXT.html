Diary
This summer, we suffered through many tough times with our fellow team members, but we also had an amazing experience and learned so much from each other. We worked hard to overcome every obstacle that came our way. It truly was an irreplaceable experience.
Want to have a taste of what we did? Please feel free to download PDF form of our experimental diaries to find out what each of us contributed to the project.
