{|align="justify"|You can write a background of your team here.  Give us a background of your team, the members, etc.  Or tell us more about something of your choosing.|[Image:Tianjin_logo.png|200px|right|frame]] |-|Orthogonal ribosomes (o-ribosomes)are able to selectively translate mRNA, with altered Shine-Dalgarno (SD) quence, not recognized by host ribosomes. Therefore, we are able to use this powerful tools to investigate translational regulation.This year, we use the o-ribosome to examine the regulation of existing protein synthesis network by rationally designing o-SD sequence, hoping to somewhat increase the yield of the protein.In addition, it is possible to construct a logical gate structure using the o-ribosome to demonstrate the beauty of the complex synthesis network.|
