Transgenic suffered from 3 aspects of nondeterminacy, the chain reactor after the altered of life structure, the potential risk of the food chain and the transgenic contamination, propagation, proliferation, and clear. Until the beginning of the 21st century, transgenic contamination has occurred in many countries world widely, such as Starlink Corn in America, transgenic canola in Canada and corn transgenic contamination in Mexico. All of these facts prove that the hazard of transgenic contamination could not be regarded. But for the limitation of the statistics, many prediction and analysis couldn’t be conducted. In our modeling process, we start from the most fundamental problem, trying to construct a right stream of proposing, analyzing and solving problem from detail to macroscopy. Two models concerning proposing problem predicted the hazard of genetic contamination. The analyzing model focused on a variety factors relating with the attitudes of four major group in society, government, industry, public and institutes. The solving model emphasized on two hands, one is the effectiveness of our project and, on the other hand, the publicizing strategy referring to the necessity of the mastery of the genetic safety knowledge. What's more, parts of our modeling can be adapted to most of the similar issues, which is a acceptable reference for the followup teams.

After thoroughly investigation of how others evaluate scientific projects, we have made up an evaluation system to assess our project through eyes of people who have been introduced about our projects. What is more, this system can also be used to comprehensively evaluate any other iGEM team projects to individual positioning and to simplify and to improve the lengthy evaluation work of iGEM judgers.

The results showed TJU 2012 rank first, and then Imperial College London 2011 and Yale 2011.
</P><P>Though the data in the above table, we can see that Yale 2011 ranks first in academic level. This is in accordance with our general thought. TJU 2012 behaves relatively poor in academic level, which is just the weakness of TJU 2012.
</P><P>In all other aspects, TJU2012 ranks first. This result is not so reasonable. We have reflected upon this problem and proposed several explanations. The main reason may be that our sample size is not large enough and our questionnaire has some unapparent flaws. We can further refine our assessment in several aspects, as shown below.
</P><P>Reallocate weight value to each assessment level. To complete the job, we need to more surveys and data.

</P><P>Transgenic technology is a newly born technology. It's used mostly in scientific fields. As a consequence, the main part of people's worry about transgenic technology comes from its wide use in research. Scientific research must obey strictly the rule of safety, especially when research is about some new technology with uncertain hazard.
</P><P>Another source of worry is remedial possibility. Genetic pollution may endanger the whole system. Since we know little about its detailed risks, and at the same time we know the possibility of great pollution can't be ignored, remedial possibility turns to be another main source of worry.
</P><P>So far, transgenic technology has little application in industry and commercial fields. For this reason, the weight of values of industrial use wide range and public emphasis are relatively small.
</P><P>In the table, the grade of genetic pollution on four perspectives is within the range of 0 to 10.

At least, there should be little barriers from various social groups. What is more, the society should pay enough attention to the newly occurred genetic pollution, and what factor has more influence on the public attention towards the genetic pollution is unquestionably urgent and important. Consequently, we designed a model to quantitatively analyze the problem. The source data of the model are derived from the questionnaire.
</P><P>Another problem that still exists is that all the probable factors that might impact the public attitude are complex and complicated that make our analysis more difficult to analysis with order. So the other task for us is to classify the factors to make sure the factors with certain primary character is classified into one group.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Classification_method_and_Evaluation_system">Classification method and Evaluation system</SPAN></H3><P>In searching for factors in various perspectives and fields that might impact the public attitude towards the genetic pollution problem, we have searched many articles and record all the potential factors, after integration we have achieved 26 factors that will potentially impact the public attitude and attention towards genetic pollution.
</P><P>
First of all, we distributed questionnaires towards the society which contains primarily four kinds of groups:
</P><OL><LI>Governmental leaders,
</LI><LI>Business decision makers,
</LI><LI>General social public,
</LI><LI>Researcher. 
</LI></OL><P>In the questionnaire we let them to grade the importance of the 26 potential factors on public attitudes.
</P><P>
Secondly, we collect these data and use the cluster analysis to analyze these factors’ grade from all the survey respondents. The principle component analysis can sep-arate these 26 factors into some groups. We can also find some inherent connections amount these factors within the same group and consequently find the significance of each group. After separation of groups, the evaluation system is constructed. The final evaluation system is shown in <B>Figure 9</B>.

And thus know what is treated as important factors or influential groups that determine the public attitude towards genetic pollution. This will be very helpful to determine what factor or group is the common one that is thought of as the most important factor that determine public attitude. Such factors or groups should be the one that deserve the devotion in attracting the public attention towards the problem.

Such factors or groups should be the one that deserve the devotion in attracting the public attention towards the problem.

The diversity of pollution makes it difficult to judge the seriousness of the many problems. A universal evaluation system of “valid eve-rywhere” risk analysis model is called for by the public. Through risk evaluation of this systematic model, we can know the hazard potential of any environmental problem in all aspects. With this system, we can also compare unfamiliar problems with the well-known ones to understand the different performance of these problems in various perspectives.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Our_evaluation_system_3">Our evaluation system</SPAN></H3><P>In assessing the various problems in divergent fields, a comprehensive evaluation contains all related specific and measurable indexes. We have done quite a lot of literature work to make sure that our evaluation system contains all related and useful perspectives. Finally, an overall and systematic evaluation system is established. The frame diagram of this system is shown in the <B>Figure 14</B>. The shape of the system seems like a tree, so it is also called evaluation tree.

The evaluation system is also very easy to use, we only need to rank the four problems waiting for evaluation through the different perspectives at the leaf note (the points which do not have child note) of the evaluation tree. After collecting of the data, we only need to do some basic calculation to obtain the final result of the evaluation of these problems on different layer of evaluation index. All these calculation results will be very helpful to help us to understand all these teams' performance in all possible level and perspectives.

At last, we have established a universal evaluation system which can assess various environmental problems especially the newly occurred ones such as the genetic pollution. This system can also assist the public to understand the new problem better from various perspective by comparing with that of the familiar problems.</DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
