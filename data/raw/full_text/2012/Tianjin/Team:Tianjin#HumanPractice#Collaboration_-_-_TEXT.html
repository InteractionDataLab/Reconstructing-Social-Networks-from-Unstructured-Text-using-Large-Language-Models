Collaboration
Peking University
We visited Peking University in the end of August, aiming at establishing collaboration between the two iGEM teams. We have had an open and interesting discussion with their teammate about experiment, modeling, and thoroughly exchanged valuable information pertaining each other's project. During the meeting, both teams have received precious advice during communication.  We offered suggestion for their modeling part, and in exchange, Peking University iGEM team generously provided their fluorescence microscope. The two teams both agree that we should promote communication and collaboration between iGEM teams in order to the support development of synthetic biology.

Searching BioBrick in the Registry is an important activity in doing iGEM. Sometimes you kind of just want to search a part when you have the idea. Therefore, it would be great if we could conduct research on our phone everywhere we like.
Luckily, SUSTC designed BioSearch this year. It is an iOS software that supports searching the Registry on your mobile device. We tested the software using our teammates' iOS devices in searching parts by name, keywords etc., and wrote useful feedback to help them improve the app.  We sincerely hope that the app would become a popular and accurate way to search BioBrick in the Registry.
Our teammate helps test BioSearch.
Nanjing University
Social network is serving an increasing role in linking people with common interests. That's how we met with Nanjing University iGEM team. They are spreading out their iGEM questionnaire on Sina Weibo, the Chinese Twitter, when we received their message about their questionnaire. Their questions are about does the iGEM website serve a good role in distributing information and offering communication. The members of our lab were pleased to answer their question, and offered our own suggestions in building a more open and interactive iGEM website that can boost the communication and collaboration in the iGEM.
Our teammates carefully answered Nanjing University's questionnaire.
