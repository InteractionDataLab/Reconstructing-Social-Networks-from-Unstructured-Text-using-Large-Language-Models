Notes of Experiments
July 6th, 2012
We discuss our all of the possible projects, and finally choose one. And then allocate works to specific member.
Do some pre-experiment and make some reagants.
Liquid LB
10g tryptone
5g yeast extract
10g NaCl
Solid LB
10g tryptone
5g yeast extract
10g NaCl
20g agar
Cleaned up the lab and laboratory instruments
July 8th, 2012
Solutions for extracting plasmid.
50mM Glucose / 25mM Tris-Cl / 10mM EDTA，pH=8.0
0.2N NaOH / 1% SDS
3M KOAc / 2M HOAc
Experiment technologies training, such as making gel, gel electrophoresis.
July 11th, 2012
Designed primers and sent orders.
Optimized the project and allocated work.
Experiment technologies and knowledge training
PCR principle and operation
Gel Extraction
July 13th, 2012
1. Received the oligo and began to mutate 16S rrnB operator.
2. Mutated RBS of RFP and checked through gel electrophoresis.
~1800bp, constant with anticipation
July 14th, 2012
Transform two plasmids of we got yestday together into E.coli.
PCR verification of colonies on the LB plates.
Inculcated the right colonies in Liquid LB.
July 15th, 2012
Extract plasmid of cells inculcated after one day.
Enzyme test of the extracted plasmid.
Inclucated the right cells in Liquid LB and added Ala partly.
July 20th, 2012
Analyse the results.
July 24th, 2012
Linked the GRP gene and O-RBS RFP gene. Gel extract the previous product again, and ligate using T4 with the following gradient.
In the same method to construct three other systems.
July 30th, 2012
Learned Fluorescence spectrophotometer.
measure the strength of GFP and RFP.
Aug. 2nd, 2012
mutated the RBS of the Amp resistance gene.
linked genes and transformed them into E. coli.
Aug. 4th, 2012
Results of plates
Aug. 8th, 2012
Began to construct the five parts needed in Assembler in Yeast. Part 1 and part 2.
Aug. 11th, 2012
Verified part 1 and 2. Synthesized the two small parts and linked through overlap PCR. Verified through ligase digestion and then gel electrophoresis.
Aug. 12th, 2012
Began to build part 3, 4 and 5. Synthesized the two small parts and linked through overlap PCR.
Aug. 14th, 2012
Verify part 3, 4 and 5. Verified through ligase digestion and then gel electrophoresis.
Aug. 18th, 2012
Transformed all the five parts into Yeast for Assembler in Yeast.
Aug. 20th, 2012
Results of the transformation.
Extract plasmids from the Yeast.
Aug. 22nd, 2012
Transformed the plasmid from the Yeast into cells.
There are purple spots on the plates
Extracted plasmid and checked through gel electrophoresis.
Some other results of Assembler in Yeast.
Aug. 25th, 2012
Began to build biobricks.
Began to search articles on phages.
Sept. 1st, 2012
Went to Peking University for exchanges.
Sept. 2nd, 2012
Found out phi X174 and firstly proposed our ideas.
The second sections of our biobricks.
Sept. 5th, 2012
Some experiments on phages.
Optimized our biobricks.
Designed primers needed for mutating Phi X174 and send orders.
Sept. 11th, 2012
Began to mutate gene G and E.
Optimized our biobricks.
Sept. 18th, 2012
Began to sort out our materials for wiki and upload the website.
