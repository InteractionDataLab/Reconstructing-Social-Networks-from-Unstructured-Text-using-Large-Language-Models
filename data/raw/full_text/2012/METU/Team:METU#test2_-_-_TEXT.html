CODH
Main aim of our project is to convert CO to CO2 and in order to do that we choose to express the enzyme called CODH (Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase) which can do this conversion biologically and we wanted to use the enzyme present in Methanocaldococcus janaschii.
Kill Switch
We needed a kill switch system to keep our genetically modified bacteria under control which are found in CO filter. With the help of this system these modified bacteria would die in the case of its release to the environment.
Cell Limiter
In order to make our biological CO filter’s activity well characterized we designed a quorum sensing system. This system keeps the cell growth under control with the help of quorum sensing signals that detect the cell density and stop the cell division.
