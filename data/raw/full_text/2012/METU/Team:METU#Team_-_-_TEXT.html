STUDENTS
Berke Gürkan
 
Boss (Demi-God)
Hi, this is Berke Gürkan from METU iGEM team 2012. I am a '12 graduate from Middle East Technical University department of Molecular Biology and Genetics. It is my second year in iGEM. I met synthetic biology and iGEM during my Erasmus year in The Netherlands, Groningen; where I immediately fell in love with the whole idea of creating genetically engineered machines that are able to do the tasks which I program them to. Believeing synthetic biology is one of the key subjects for taking biological sciences one step further and creating the lifestyle of tomorrow I started the iGEM 2012 team in METU. Through the process I learned even further and had a greater vision of synthetic biology which keeps fascinating me every single day. It is just incredible to design a biological system which can help the world get rid of the problems they normally cannot by physical means. This year I had quite a lot of fun working on the project with the most awesome team members. All together we hope to add a notch to synthetic biology in the upcoming years.

Gözde Arabaci
 
Wet Lab (Tourist)
I’m Gözde Arabaci, a third year student at the department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in METU. This was my first year in iGEM and I contributed my team in the lab work. I heard about iGEM two years ago, in my first year at METU and I became interested in synthetic biology. That’s why I want my future studies to be in the field of synthetic biology.                                 It was great to be a part of an iGEM team because I learned so many new things and of course I had so much fun. That’s why for the new iGEM teams I can say that, work hard but don’t forget to enjoy every minute of this competition.

Melike Dönertas
 
Software/Modeling (Research-Maniac)
I'm Melike Dönertas, a third year student at Molecular Biology and Genetics Department. I am also studying Information Systems as minor program. This is the first iGEM experience for me and I am very enthusiastic for the following years :) I mainly worked on modelling part of project. I am very happy to be a member of iGEM team because while I was learning so many things I also had lots of fun. In this competition we are in charge of project and I think that is very important. iGEM is also a very important opportunity to learn how to overcome obstacles during a study and how to be a team.

Alisan Kayabölen
 
Wet Lab (Insomnia in person)
I am Alisan Kayabölen. I’ve just graduated from Molecular Biology and Genetics department and this year I’m starting my master study at Biomedical Engineering, METU.                                  Until this summer, I couldn’t do anything at “genetics” side of my own department. I studied on stem cells and tissue engineering fields during my internship and special project course. So, iGEM was a huge chance for me to study genetics and learn many techniques about synthetic biology. My dream is to be able to combine tissue engineering and synthetic biology fields.                                 I’ve worked mainly at wet lab part of our team. And, I also tried to find sponsors for our project, but it is difficult to say that I was very successful?

Özgün Kirdar
 
Funding & Human Practice (Half-Giant)
My name is Özgün Kirdar, a second year student at the Biology Department in METU.  I am a wetlab asisstant and also responsible for human practices and sponsorships in our team. Before deciding what I want to do in future, I want to learn and experience the fields of biology as much as I can.                                  Why iGEM ? Because I think iGEM is the best option for me to gain experience at synthetic biology.                                  I don't  have a good suggestion to new iGEM teams, because I am also new to iGEM. I can only                                  say '' Do your best and try to have some fun. ''.

Wet Lab (Looks Like Jesus)
I’m Emre Ilpars, a second year student at the Department of Biology in METU.  In our team, I have mainly worked on wet lab as an assistant and helped to my friends in human practices. As a Biology student, I didn’t know the basics of molecular biology but these lab experiences really helped me to learn new information and techniques from the seniors.  Because there are a lot of field in Biology, I haven’t decide what I am going to do in future but thanks to my iGEM experiences I am started to think that I will study on synthetic biology.

Burak Özcan
 
Wet Lab (Legal Slaves: The Boyfriend)
My name is Burak ÖZCAN and I am a senior student in Biology department in METU. I have mainly worked in wet lab part of iGEM team but I have also take a role in the sponsorship and the human practice parts of our team.  I think being an iGEM member is a great challenge to overcome and the experience of working on a project of our own is a unique gift for an undergraduate student like us. Solving problems of our own is another crucial opportunity that we could achieve. I believe on the light of these experiences I will fallow path that leads me great success.

Oguz Bolgi
 
Wet Lab (Team's Drunk Bear)
I’m Oguz Bolgi a second year student at the Molecular Biology and Genetics Department in METU.  My position in our team is that of an assistant actually, I try to learn the techniques from our seniors by assisting them and later on I get my hands dirty by trying out my new learned techniques. I want to learn as much as possible because I want to continue in the field of synthetic biology.                                  To the question, why iGEM, I have only one answer, why not?                                  My suggestion to new iGEM teams would be to work hard, buy lots of coffee and have tons of fun.                                 .
