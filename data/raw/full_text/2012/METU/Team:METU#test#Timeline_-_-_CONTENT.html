Today the all that responded our announcements to be a part of the iGEM competition representing the METU-IGEM team got together for the first time. In total we have got 50 interested students, 2 instructors and 1 adviser. We started by introducing ourselves then we talked about our past IGEM experiences. Here, with the audiences we decided to make a brainstorming session which should be after reading enough about more on synthetic biology. Furthermore, we decided to make a brainstorming session to decide on our project after 1 week. </P><P>18.12.2011: Brainstorming Session Part 1:
To make a successful plan we know that the first think should be done is coming together and adding the ideas each other. In the first part of the brainstorming we simply think everything and write them on the board! (add the photo 1)</P><P>25.12.2011: Brainstorming Session Part 2:
In the second part of the brainstorming we continue to storm the ideas and writing down to the board. Then we made a schedule to think the ideas for their feasibility and if it is possible making circuits of the plans. (add the photo 2)</P><P>

03.01.2012: Eliminating the Ideas:
The imagination of our team was extremely high because ,our team consists mainly first and second year students. At the end of the brainstorming sessions, there were lots of crazy ideas; however, we had to eliminate them. Finally we ended up with two main project. By trying to choose our main project, the several managerial tasks were divided among the team members. By doing so everyone got the chance to use their experience while learning from each other. Then we divided our team as a 4 different sub-groups;
 

13.02.2012: Article Reading
In the middle of the semester holiday, we did a meeting to give some homework to team members. We decided to prepare an article pool about our two main projects. By collecting information, we could have decided which one was more possible or which parts we had to add or remove from our projects.

27.02.2012: Deciding to main project “ CO FILTER”
After semester holiday, we had read and summarized so many articles. With this huge amount of information we prepared lots of presentations to transfer the information and to discuss about them.  After reading and discussing the so many articles related to our two main topics, we chose CO filter as our main project. 

06.03.2012: To build the system of our project
Because our team members were inexperienced ,we had mini classes in which the basis of genetic engineering is taught. After this time, we all were excellent article readers. We tried to access all possible information about our project and try to build up the system, by finding available promoters ,genes,etc.  We finally built the system and we presented it to our advisors. 

13.03.2012: Searching for sponsorship
Just after deciding our project, we started to search for sponsorship for our team. We started to make telephone calls to every single company or government unit about our project. In this time , we started to search for a new lab.

20.03.2012: Building our own iGEM laboratory
Our instructor ,Mrs. Akkaya had already  offered her lab for our experiments. However, this wasn’t enough for us. So after this search, we found a new lab in the basement of Chemistry Building. This lab was being used as storage for this building and was full of unnecessary stuff. By the time, we collected the last parts of our system and we all started to clean our new lab.(temizlik resimleri)
