                        Today the all that responded our announcements to be a part of the iGEM competition representing the METU-IGEM team got together for the first time. In total we have got 50 interested students, 2 instructors and 1 adviser. We started by introducing ourselves then we talked about our past IGEM experiences. Here, with the audiences we decided to make a brainstorming session which should be after reading enough about more on synthetic biology. Furthermore, we decided to make a brainstorming session to decide on our project after 1 week. 
                    </P><P><FONT face="tahoma" size="3" color="maroon"><B>18.12.2011</B></FONT>: Brainstorming Session Part 1:
                        To make a successful plan we know that the first think should be done is coming together and adding the ideas each other. In the first part of the brainstorming we simply think everything and write them on the board! 
                    </P><P><FONT face="tahoma" size="3" color="maroon"><B>25.12.2011</B></FONT>: Brainstorming Session Part 2:
                        In the second part of the brainstorming we continue to storm the ideas and writing down to the board. Then we made a schedule to think the ideas for their feasibility and if it is possible making circuits of the plans.

                        The imagination of our team was extremely high because ,our team consists mainly first and second year students. At the end of the brainstorming sessions, there were lots of crazy ideas; however, we had to eliminate them. Finally we ended up with two main project. By trying to choose our main project, the several managerial tasks were divided among the team members. By doing so everyone got the chance to use their experience while learning from each other. Then we divided our team as a 4 different sub-groups; Wetlab workers, Software workers, People who interested in funding and Human Practice group.There were ofcourse some interactions between groups.

                        In the middle of the semester holiday, we did a meeting to give some homeworks to team members. We decided to prepare an article pool about our two main projects. By collecting information, we could have decided which one was more possible or which parts we had to add or remove from our projects.

                        After semester holiday, we had read and summarized so many articles. With this huge amount of information we prepared lots of presentations to transfer the information and to discuss about them.  After reading and discussing the so many articles related to our two main topics, we chose CO filter as our main project.

                        Because our team members were unexperienced ,we had mini classes in which the basis of genetic engineering is taught. After this time, we all were excellent article readers. We tried to access all possible information about our project and try to build up the system, by finding available promoters ,genes,etc.  We finally built the system and we presented it to our advisors.

                        Just after deciding our project, we started to search for sponsorship for our team. We started to make telephone calls to every single company or government unit about our project. In this time , we started to search for a new lab.

                        Our instructor ,Mrs. Akkaya had already  offered her lab for our experiments. However, this wasn`t enough for us. So after this search, we found a new lab in the basement of Chemistry Building. This lab was being used as storage for this building and was full of unnecessary stuff. By the time, we collected the last parts of our system and we all started to clean our new lab.

Moreover, they implemented almost all of their ideas; making a short movie, organizing a iGEM party and a picnic with the other iGEM team of Turkey:Baskent University team,going to funfair to tell people about iGEM,etc.

Because of our limited budget ,we can only place an old PCR machine named as UMUT. Then we had opened the box sent by iGEM with big excitement for the first time.

                        As a beginning of our wet lab work, we prepared lots of plates with agar medium.  It was necessary to prepare them continuously during our working period. The first preparation was so excited for every one of us; however after time passing, this part has become the most boring part of study.

                            At that night, we had our party with 300 visitors. We had lots of surprises, which introduces iGEM, for our guests. We wore our lab coats and had great fun through all night. Up to early in the morning, the music wasn`t closed. We left a great impression in our visitors?mind about iGEM competition.

ONC of the ready plates were prepared. From the parts are going it seems that the parts won`t be ready to submit :( One of the parts seems ready and we think characterization of CODH can be done at least.
