CO Converter
Kill Switch
Cell Limiter
Data for our favourite parts:
1. http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K843001 Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase generator with constitutive promoterCarbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase enzyme from Mycobacterium bovis strain BCG, containing medium small and large chains. This enzyme is able to convert carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and vice versa depending on their concentrations.
2. http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K843004 T4 lysis device regulated by IPTGWith this part any bacterial cell will go into cell lysis as long as they do not have enough IPTG in their cells.
3. http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K843007 Cell Limiter using quorum sensingThe device inhibits cell division after it reaches a critical level. For this we used MinC as the cell division inhibitor. The critical level can be changed by changing the promoter before the LuxI region.
