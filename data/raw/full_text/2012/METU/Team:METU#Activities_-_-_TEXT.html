1.Metu Orientation Days
In order to promote synthetic biology and IGEM organization, as IGEM METU team we participated the event of METU Orientation Days for newly coming students. In the organization with a specific stand for our team we explained some facts about synthetic biology with the fine presentations and the posters of our professors’ works. Also, with the great effort we tried to answer every single question about both synthetic biology and IGEM competition. http://www.metu.edu.tr/tr/odtu-tanitim-gunleri-12
 
 
2.Party time for Synthetic Biology lovers!
To draw the public attention to both the synthetic biology we thought both funny and educational way, and so we said how did we integrate human practices in our synthetic biology project? The answer was in the part of parties! As IGEM members we planned a party. In the party both we had  lots of fun and took the people attentions on IGEM competition. Actually, by that way we both gain some followers and sponsors.

3.iGEM Student Club
Moreover, we made an effort to create and official IGEM community in METU to gain more support and member. The main aim of official iGEM community is increase the synthetic biology knowledge firstly in biological sciences department then whole university, city and country.  Furthermore, this community also aims at improve practical side of the members besides the theoretical side of them.
 
4. Team Song!!!
 
I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
Transformation is my real test
Synthesizing my cause
 
I will surf across the web
For researchs far and  wide
Each plasmid to understand
The promoter that’s inside
 
E.coli DH5 alpha
It’s you and me
I know its my destiny
E.coli
 
Oo you’re my best friend
In a world we must defend
E.coli (Dh5 alpha)
A germ so true
Our knowledge will pull us through
You infect  me and I will kill you
E.coliiii!!!!
Synthesize them all!!!
 
5. BACK TO BASICS
Furthermore, to gain the attention of high school students, we just “went to basics”, we went to the high school of one of our team members and presented the competition as well as synthetic biology as a field which they can choose to study. To this voluntarily presentation, 88 students chose to participate and not only the students but also the teachers and the assistant principal which was an ex-biology teacher were amazed by the opportunities synthetic biology provides. We tried to encourage the school to participate in the HS division of iGEM, hopefully next year we will see them in this competition as well.
