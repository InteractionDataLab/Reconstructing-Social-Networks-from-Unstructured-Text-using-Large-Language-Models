I am a '12 graduate from Middle East Technical University department of Molecular Biology and Genetics. It is my second year in iGEM. I met synthetic biology and iGEM during my Erasmus year in The Netherlands, Groningen; where I immediately fell in love with the whole idea of creating genetically engineered machines that are able to do the tasks which I program them to. Believeing synthetic biology is one of the key subjects for taking biological sciences one step further and creating the lifestyle of tomorrow I started the iGEM 2012 team in METU. Through the process I learned even further and had a greater vision of synthetic biology which keeps fascinating me every single day. It is just incredible to design a biological system which can help the world get rid of the problems they normally cannot by physical means. This year I had quite a lot of fun working on the project with the most awesome team members. All together we hope to add a notch to synthetic biology in the upcoming years.
