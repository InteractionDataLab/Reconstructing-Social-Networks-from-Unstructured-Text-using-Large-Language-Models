NOTEBOOK - SEPT
Run gel of product from enzyme restriction cut (HsSRI-HsHtrI-Ectar gene) and the size of the bandings are correct, followed by gel purification.
Ligation is done and the product is being transformed to Top10 competent cells, followed by spread plate.
Pick clones from the plate containing cells that contain NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectsr gene.
Bacterial cultures of picked clones that contain NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectsr gene are being sent for sequencing.
Testing cells that contain NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectsr gene under monochromic light using 0.5% soft agar plate while another identical plate is being place in the dark for comparison.
Pick clones from the plate containing cells that contain NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar gene.
Bacterial cultures of picked clones that contain NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar gene are being sent for sequencing.
Testing cells that contain NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar gene under monochromic light using 0.5% soft agar plate while another identical plate is being place in the dark for comparison.
Pick clones from the plate containing cells that contain HsSRI-HsHtrI-Ectar gene.
Bacterial cultures of picked clones that contain HsSRI-HsHtrI-Ectar gene are being sent for sequencing.
Testing cells that contain HsSRI-HsHtrI-Ectar gene under monochromic light using 0.5% soft agar plate while another identical plate is being place in the dark for comparison.
Sequencing results shown that the sequence of plasmids containing NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectsr-standard backbone gene are correct. A new biobrick is successfully made.
Sequencing results shown that the sequence of plasmids containing NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar-standard backbone gene are correct. A new biobrick is successfully made.

Characterization of promoter Bba_J23100 using DH5α.
Characterization of promoter Bba_J23100 using TOP10.
Characterization of promoter Bba_J23100 using BL21.
Repeat characterization of promoter Bba_J23100 using DH5α.
Repeat characterization of promoter Bba_J23100 using TOP10.
Repeat characterization of promoter Bba_J23100 using BL21.
Second repeat characterization of promoter Bba_J23100 using DH5α. After three times of characterization, the result shown that DM5αis not optimal for this promoter.
Second repeat characterization of promoter Bba_J23100 using TOP10. After three times of characterization, the result shown that Top 10 can effectively expresses the protein.
Second repeat characterization of promoter Bba_J23100 using BL21. After three times of characterization, the result shown that BL21 can effectively expresses the protein.
