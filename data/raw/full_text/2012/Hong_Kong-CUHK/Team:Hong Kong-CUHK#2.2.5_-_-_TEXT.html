CH2.2.5 - NEW APPLICATION
“We're guessing that you have great ideas that nobody has ever thought about, or if they have they forgot to tell somebody else. Can you imagine an entirely new application area for biological technology?”
Example:
In the body, the enzymes are not directed to the substrates, and catalysis only occurs when they meet each other after randomly moving around.
Like shortening the distance of each working section during the industrial revolution for a higher efficiency of the entire production, the stable DNA chain can be used as an assembling line for catalysis. Each enzyme can be fused onto DNA china and line up in order, so they can carry out the catalysis one after another. This application shortens the distance and increases the efficiency of the reactions.
