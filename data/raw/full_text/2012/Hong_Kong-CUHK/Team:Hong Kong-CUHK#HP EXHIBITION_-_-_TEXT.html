FUTURE PLANS - Exhibition
ANIMATION
Time: 3 minutes long
Content:
Synthetic Biology,
Application and Examples of Synthetic Biology
Safety and Ethics Issues about Synthetic Biology
POSTERS ( Click here to see Posters )
Sizes: 3 ft X 6 ft - for posting on the wall, and 0.9m X 1.8m - the booth
Part 1.
Theme: Synthetic Biology and iGEM
Color Scheme: white
 
Content:
Central Dogma:
DNA – Genetic information for everything of an organism – Master Book
          *Transcription – converting genetic information into RNAs codes
                              – select the necessary/suitable recipe from the Masterpiece
RNA – Copy of DNA, messenger of the genetic information – Copies of Master Recipes
         *Translation – RNA codes is translate into amino acids  
                          – produce according to the selected copy of masterpiece
Ribosome – site of protein synthesis – factory, where products are produced
Protein – Function and structural product of transcription and translation – Product
Biobricks:
            A sequence of DNA = a protein that carries a function/reaction = a biobrick
→ Biobrick + Biobrick = reaction + reaction = a system
→ Biobrick + Biobrick + Biobrick + …= System + System …. = an microorganism
            Genes → Proteins → Biochemical Reaction → Pathways → Cells → Tissues and Cultures
Synthetic biology
is an emerging field of biology which specifically applies the concept of biobricks to create systems of an organism, or even modify the biobricks to invent new systems for the natural organism. It uses the fundamental information in biology to create molecules and systems for biochemical reactions and pathways, and the entire thing is a technology that we may use to invent the solution for the problems we have on Earth.
iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines):
Origin: the competition was developed from a student project during a month-long course in 2003. The students designed a system to make cells blink! More university joined the competition aft wards, and iGEM eventually become a worldwide competition in 2005. In 2011, there were 165 teams.
Foundation: Through the competition, the knowledge of synthetic biology is broadened, and
Competition: It is a synthetic biology competition for undergraduate students to design biological system by making and modifying biobricks, and more importantly, students can creatively solve problems and invent solution by applying biological technology appropriately. iGEM also aims to arouse public ‘s awareness about biological technology and engineering, so the world could be a better world with the change we make.

Part 2.
Theme: Representative iGEM Example of Each Category
Color Scheme: light red, red, and dark red
Content:
This part is to show how synthetic biology can be applied in different fields, and how the technology may affect human’s life style in the furture.
Food – Harvard 2010 – Flavor Shuffling for picky eater
Environmental – Imperial College 2011 – Auxin for Deserfication
Energy – University of Pavia (2009) – Ethanol Production from Whey
Information Processing – CUHK 2010 – Bioencryption and Bio-data storage
Technology – CUHK 2011 – Electricity Generation
Health – University of Washington 2011 – Gluten Destruction - Avoid allergy
Medicine – MIT2011 – Tissue by Design
Part 3.
Theme: Safety + Ethics
Color Scheme: Black
Content:    
Safety &Ethics
1. Why do we consider the safety?
- Biosafety and biosecurity
2. What are the regulations that we, scientists need to follow?
3. Is bioengineered cell a friend or foes?
- Risk of accidental release, risk of testing in the open environment, risk of deliberate misuse
4. How to prevent abuse and misuse of synthetic biology and protect ourselves?
- Government, scientists, public
SURVEYS- BOARD AND BOOK
Theme: CUHK iGEM 2012
Content:
A board with questions, and a book and some markers are provided for audience of the exhibition to comment. The questions are specifically about the CUHK iGEM ideas:
