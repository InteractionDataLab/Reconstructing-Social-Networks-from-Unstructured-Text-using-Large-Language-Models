CH2.2.4 - MANUFACTURING
“Have you ever heard of nanotechnology? Well, biology is a nanotechnology that already exists, and that actually works. The ribosome is a programmable nanoassembler embedded within a reproducing machine. Could we responsibly use biology to manufacture useful products, from the nanoscale (atoms) to the decascale (buildings and bridges)? What can biology be programmed to manufacture?”
Example:
BioFactory for Efficiency
The current methods for purification of biomolecule from cellular lysate are expensive and time consuming.
BioFactory are modular microfluidic chips that modified enzymes attached onto the surface of corresponding chip, and when combined in series, these chips operate as a linear biochemical pathway for continuous flow reactions. To reduce the undesired reaction and lower the costs of producing bio-pharmaceuticals in the future, E. coli was engineered with the mechanism for light-induced apoptosis, so they only flow through the through the microfluidic channels, coating them with the desired enzyme, so the traditional protocol is unnecessary.
