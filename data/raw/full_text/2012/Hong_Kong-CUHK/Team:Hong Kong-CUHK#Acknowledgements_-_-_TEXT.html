ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We, the Hong Kong – CUHK iGEM 2012 team, draw on the experience and support of many individuals and institutions, and wish to acknowledge it publicly. Their support and contribution made our project, Light of No Return, and human practise activities possible, leading to the preparation of this guidebook.   We would first like to give acknowledgement to our professors and instructors whose advice and dedication encouraged us to strive for gold. We would like to thank:
Prof. KONG Siu Kai Prof. YUNG Pun To Douglas Mr. Qin Hao University Safety Office, CUHK
The process of mutual learning which generated this guidebook also drew heavily on the support of the six institutions contributing to the Light of No Return project. We would like to thank their collective contribution of laboratory apparatus and materials to our iGEM lab. They are:
Biochemistry Programme CUGEN Limited Department of Electrical Engineering (CUHK) Eastwin Faculty of Biomedical Engineering (CUHK) Faculty of Engineering (CUHK) Faculty of Science (CUHK) Fong’s Family Foundation GenScript Master of Science in Biochemical and Biomedical Sciences (CUHK) Office of Institutional Advancement (CUHK) Tin Hang Technology Limited
