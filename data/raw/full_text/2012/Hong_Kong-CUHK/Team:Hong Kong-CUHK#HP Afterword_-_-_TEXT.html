AFTERWORD
Each team starts as a small group of people with the pure interest and little curiosity over the truth and potential of the new science. We then become determined to continue in the endless space of the game for different potential abilities. We may find ourselves immersed in challenges surrounded by questions; yet stoop deeply into where students can impossibly reach without such participation. Like the old saying goes “from small beginning come great things.” Each team turns the abstract idea into a concrete project to redefine the limitation of human in conquering difficulty, solving problems, or even dealing global issues.   We hope this book is not only the guidance but also an inspiration for the high school students, for them to experience what we have earned throughout the progress in the competition.
