CH2.2 - BRAINSTORMING
“I have formed a team, what should we do now?”
Now you have to put on your thinking caps. You can brainstorm for projects from different points of view or strategies. One ways is known as the “bottom-up” strategy where you think of a BioBrick construction and incorporate it into a potential system or device. Another tactic is the “top-down” strategy where you look for an inconvenience, inadequacy or a novel application, then you device a BioBrick to resolve the situation. Synthetic Biology has great potential for applications in different fields such as food and energy, information processing and health and medicine. Listed here are some examples of different industries, also known as tracks.
Choosing Tracks
Here are the tracks with the descriptions from iGEM criteria, and one project from previous iGEM team is given as an example for each tract.
Each tract is arranged in page as shown below:
 
             2.2.1 Food & Energy  
             2.2.2 Environment        
             2.2.3 Health & Medicine        
             2.2.4 Manufacturing    
             2.2.5 New  Application  
             2.2.6 Foundational  Advance   
             2.2.7 Information  Processing
