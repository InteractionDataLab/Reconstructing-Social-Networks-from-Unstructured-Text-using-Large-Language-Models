HUMAN PRACTICE
Human practice in the iGEM competition is about bringing Synthetic Biology to people’s lives through various ways. Using the simplest way, we decided to promote both topics through providing some educational activities for some high schools and arranging an exhibition at our university. Both ways aimed to present the basic information about iGEM and Synthetic Biology, as well as to arouse their interest toward the new field of science and encourage their involvement in iGEM competition. Moreover, surveys were conducted to investigate how students think about iGEM and Synthetic Biology and then analysed to provide suggestions or point out the suitable approaches for human practice of Synthetic Biology.
