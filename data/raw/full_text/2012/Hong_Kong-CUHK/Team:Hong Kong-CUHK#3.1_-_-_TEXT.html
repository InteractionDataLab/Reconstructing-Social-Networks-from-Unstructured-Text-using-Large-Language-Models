CH3.1 - ACQUIRE A LAB
The laboratory will be the home and witness to the progress and development of your project. Furthermore you will need to acquire a lab and register it to gain access to the BioBrick Parts Registry from which you can obtain the necessary parts for your project.
Most high schools in Hong Kong have their own laboratory facilities that simply need additional equipment. However, if yours does not, there is no need to worry. There are several ways you can acquire fully equipped laboratory facilities.
(1) The Hong Kong Science Park has fully equipped laboratory spaces and engineering services available at an hourly basis or on project basis. They can also provide equipment that tailor to your project needs.
(2) If your instructors are university students, or members of the alumni, you can request to use a university laboratory during the course of your project.
