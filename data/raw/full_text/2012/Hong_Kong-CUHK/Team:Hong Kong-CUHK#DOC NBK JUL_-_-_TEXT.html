NOTEBOOK - JULY
Miniprep of picked clones from transformed NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar-backbone cells.
Plasmids containing NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar -backbone gene were sent to sequencing.
Make plate with 0.5% soft agar with antibiotics- chloramphenicol.
Make plate with antibiotics –Ampiclin.
Overlapping PCR of NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectsr-backbone which the plasmid is responsible in repelling from blue light.
Direct transformation of NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectsr-backbone gene, follow by spread plate.
Miniprep of picked clones from transformed HsSRI-HsHtrI-Ectsr-backbone cells.
Sequencing results shown that the sequence of plasmids containing NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar-backbone gene are incorrect.
Overlapping PCR of NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar -backbone which the plasmid is responsible in attracting by blue light.
Make LB agar solution
Direct transformation of NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar-backbone gene, follow by spread plate.
No clone was being found on the plate containing transformed NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar-backbone cells.
Overlapping PCR of NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar-backbone which the plasmid is responsible in attracting by blue light.
Direct transformation of NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar-backbone gene, follow by spread plate.
Pick clones from transformed NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar-backbone cells.
Miniprep of picked clones from transformed NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar-backbone cells.
Miniprep of picked clones from transformed NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar-backbone cells and was sent for sequencing.
Sequencing results shown that the sequence of plasmids containing NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar -backbone gene is correct.
The sequenced cells which contain the NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar-backbone gene are being cultured in 0.5% soft agar plate for testing using normal light bulb with its corresponding antibiotics.
Repeat in testing cells that contain the NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectar-backbone gene are being cultured in 0.5% soft agar     plate for testing using normal light bulb with its corresponding antibiotics.
Pick clones from transformed NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectsr-backbone cells.
Plasmids containing HsSRI-HsHtrI-Ectsr -backbone gene were sent to sequencing.
Miniprep of picked clones from transformed NpSRII-NpHtrII-Ectsr-backbone cells.
