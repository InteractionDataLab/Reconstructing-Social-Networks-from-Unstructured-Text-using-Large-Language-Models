CH2.1 - FORMING A TEAM
“I am interested in creating a Synthetic Biology project, but where do I begin?”
Coming together is a beginning. To get started you first need to form a team. The structure of iGEM teams is flexible. You can choose to form a several teams with students from different grades and classes in your school. You can also choose to form a regional team and collaborate with high school students and instructors from different schools.
“Who do we need in our team and how do we find them?”
Your team will need to comprise of at least 1 student and 1 instructor, but why have only 2 people when you can make a bigger team and have more fun?  You may first consult with any of Hong Kong’s existing collegiate teams. We may offer you guidance regarding recruitment of team members.
There are various ways you can recruit students and instructors for your team such as poster advertisements and brochures around your school campus. You can also make an online forum to find students from other schools who would be interested in joining your team. Take advantage of the many social networking platforms such as Facebook.
It is recommended you find team members with from various disciplines, backgrounds, and levels of expertise. You will also need members with strengths in public speaking who are confident in giving presentations to a large audience, graphic design,
Below is a checklist of who you may ask for help with recruitment or to be part of the first iGEM HS Hong Kong team, as well as a checklist of the different positions and responsibilities different members can take within the team.
