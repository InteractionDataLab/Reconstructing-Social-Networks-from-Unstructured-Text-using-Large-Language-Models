CH2.2.6 - FOUNDATIONAL ADVANCE
“Just thirty-five years ago, scientists could not cut and paste pre-existing fragments of genetic material like we can today. The discovery and application of DNA recombination allowed us to assemble new genes. The synthetic biology community needs other enabling technologies that help to make new accomplishments possible. What are other types of basic tricks does nature use? Have you discovered and applied one that could revolutionize synthetic biology?”
Example:
In Synthetic Biology, standard parts are registered, and the information of each part is uploaded onto the iGEM websites. Synthetic biologists either modify the previous parts or create a new one, but in either ways, there are difficulties.
One way to deal with them is to create different mutants of the standard parts which have various characteristics and recorded them as a “Mutant library”. One of the mutants may be suitable for the future modification or creation with its appropriate protein-binding ability, satisfactory expression strength, and peculiar sensitivity to the chemical used.
