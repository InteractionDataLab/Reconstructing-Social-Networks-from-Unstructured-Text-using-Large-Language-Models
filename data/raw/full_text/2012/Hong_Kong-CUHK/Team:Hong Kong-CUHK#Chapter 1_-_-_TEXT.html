CH1 - WHAT'S SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY?
“I have never heard of Synthetic Biology before. What are BioBricks? What is iGEM about?”
In a city of about 7 million, there are over 500 high schools with nearly half a million students. And with only 3 out of 8 universities in Hong Kong, namely The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), The Hong Kong University (HKU), and The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), participating in iGEM, a majority of Hong Kong high school students still do not know much about Synthetic Biology, the concept of BioBricks and iGEM. This shows that more effort can be focused on promoting synthetic biology. Our previous high school outreach which included around 200 students was only the tip of the iceberg, therefore in this secondary investigation, we would like to outreach to high school students, as well as the general public, at a larger scale. Hence, the first component of this book is a brief introduction to these topics.
Synthetic Biology is the combination of systems biology, engineering, computer science and molecular biology. These are collectively applied in the redesigning and re-engineering of a living system to manufacture products that do not occur in the natural environment. Various products of synthetic biology have also contributed to improvements and discoveries in science and our everyday surroundings.
The BioBrick Part Registry is a collection of genetic parts which, like Lego parts, can be arranged in numerous ways to build synthetic biology devices and systems. The registry serves as an open source catalogue and database, making a wide array of genetic part available for synthetic biology labs, academic labs and perspective project innovators and entrepreneurs. BioBricks are the basic units and components of Synthetic Biology. Like blocks of Lego, they can be mixed and matched to obtain desired gene products as the cornerstone of a system or device.
iGEM embodies the use of BioBricks and the advancement of Synthetic Biology through hands on laboratory experience and community outreach. It also provides a platform for international convening of young aspiring scientists interested in experiencing this branch of science outside of the classroom.
