CONCLUSION
According to the 3 sets of survey analyses, iGEM and Synthetic Biology are not well-known in our community. To spread out the information effectively, exhibition should be organized asides from the educational programs. For better understanding of the high school students who can join iGEM HS, we need to modify the educational program to equip them to do wet labs and apply Synthetic Biology to create solutions. As for our fellow undergraduates, we may suggest CUHK to recruit students of different majors, so they are required to conduct active learning about Synthetic Biology. Moreover, the larger the data the more accurate the result, we could continue the same investigation on undergraduates and high school students next year to ensure today’s result or even go beyond.
 
Suggestion for CUHK iGEM 2013
Maximize popularity of iGEM and Synthetic Biology through an exhibition
Organize an educational program for high school students which includes:
- some examples related to our daily life or taught in high school
- a wet lab section for them to get ready for iGEM HS
Aim for a better team work
- Recruit members according to the survey result for potential expertise
- Compare the progress with the previous CUHK iGEM teams and improve the organization of the team
Carry on this investigation to seek the effective and suitable human practice of Synthetic Biology in our community.
