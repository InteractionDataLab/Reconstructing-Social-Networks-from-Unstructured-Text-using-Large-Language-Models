SURVEYS - Potential iGEMers from Different Fields
Afterwards we asked fellow undergraduates, including students outside the Faculty of Science and Faculty of Engineering (which have been the only two faculties the university recruits students for the iGEM member from), if they like to join the next iGEM competition. About 64.8% of our respondents showed interest in contributing their efforts.

Of these 64.8%, 7 students were from the Faculty of Arts, 13 came from the Faculty of Business Administration, 13 were from the Faculty of Engineering and 40 came from the Faculty of Science. We asked, specifically, these people which type of expertise they would like to contribute their talents, sorted them according to their majors, and we received the following responses:

From the graphs, we found that students from different fileds all want to be involved in idea and research development. Students majoring in Art showed the highest percentages among students from different majors in design. Business major students had multiple preferences. More than 70% of students from Business faculty would choose to promote iGEM and Synthetic Biology. Nearly 20% of them would like to be secretary and organize fund raising. Science majors had a percentage that is the highest among all the respondents in several options: consultation, clinical testing, risk and safety assessment, and significantly, wet lab.  More than half of the Engineering students would like to do dry lab, and some of they also think they could contribute in education.
 
Without proper promotion like the talk or workshop designed for high school students, significant percentages of undergraduates in CUHK would like to join iGEM and support the university team with their profession. As iGEM is a comprehensive competition that does not only include science or engineering knowledge but also other skills, engineering and science majors in CUHK are required to do multi-tasking to accomplish an iGEM project each year. While the fellows of other majors are interested to join us, we should consider recruitment different teammates from our diverse student body for CUHK iGEM 2013. We also summed up the useful data into a table:
