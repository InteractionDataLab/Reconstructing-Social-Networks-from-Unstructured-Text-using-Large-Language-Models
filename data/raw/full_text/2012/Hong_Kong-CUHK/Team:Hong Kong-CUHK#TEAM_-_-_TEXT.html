TEAM DESCRIPTION
This is the third year that the Chinese University of Hong Kong participates in the iGEM competition.  Our team consists of 15 undergraduate students from Science and Engineering faculties, which is instructed by several well-experienced postgraduates and professors.  We hope that through our work in our project and human practice, our team members and the public could understand more about this new branch of biology.  We wish a great success to all the participants of this year’s iGEM competition.
