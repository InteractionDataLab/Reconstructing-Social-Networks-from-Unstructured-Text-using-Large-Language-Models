CH2.2.2 - ENVIRONMENT
“Can biotechnology be used to help clean the air, provide fresh drinking water, restore or enhance soil quality, terraform a near-Earth asteroid, or protect, preserve, or enhance natural biological diversity?”
Example:
Auxin is a solution for desertification
A worldwide problem, densification causes loss of resources and lands and leads to soil erosion. Auxin was designed to accelerate plant root development via its contracted genomic system. As seeds are coated with this type of bacteria and germinate in soil, the bacteria can move toward the roots via additional chemoreceptor. Later, as they enter or taken by the root, their modified pathways leads to secretion of the hormone, auxin that promotes growth and thus prevent soil erosion. The long term vision of this project is to revitalize dry land and make soil fertile again for vegetation
Specific Human Practice of Auxin:
Gene guard is a containment device to allow nonviable transfer of incomplete genome during the horizontal gene transfer which minimizes the risk of accidental release of modified genomes to the environment.
