CH3 - WHAT DO WE NEED TO CREATE OUR PROJECT?
“We have some good project ideas, but we do not have adequate laboratory facilities”
One other major concern among students and teachers alike is that high school labs in Hong Kong are fully equipped with the necessary apparatus and tools to make BioBricks. This chapter will cover how you can acquire a laboratory, the equipment and materials you will need in your laboratory, as well as the necessary safety precautions you need to take when handling microorganisms.
     3.1 Acquire a Lab
     3.2 Laboratory Equipment Checklist
     3.3 Laboratory Safety and Useful Techniques
