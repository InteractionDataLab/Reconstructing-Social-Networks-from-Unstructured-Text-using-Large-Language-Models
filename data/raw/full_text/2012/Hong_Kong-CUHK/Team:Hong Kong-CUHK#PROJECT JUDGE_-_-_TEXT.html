JUDGING FORM
iGEM Medals for Non-Software Teams
We believe our team deserves the following medal:  ✓Bronze ✓Silver ✓Gold
Because we met the following criteria (check all that apply and provide details where needed)
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
✓Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Regional Jamboree.
✓Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2012 Judging form.
✓Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
✓Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
✓Enter information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Including:
✓Primary nucleic acid sequence Description of function
✓Authorship
✓Safety notes, if relevant.
✓Acknowledgment of sources and references
✓Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry.
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
✓Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device.
✓Enter this information and other documentation on the part's 'Main Page' section of the Registry
Part Number(s): BBa_K786001 , BBa_K786002 , BBa_K786003 , BBa_K786004 , BBa_K786010 , BBa_K786031
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal: (One or More)
✓Improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Experience Page of the Registry.
Part Number(s): BBa_J23100 , BBa_K317028
✓Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing and innovation.

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. (more...) To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
✓Best Human Practice Advance
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these three special prizes:
We did comprehensive survey to find out their response on iGEM and synthetic biology of high school and university students in Hong Kong. We analyzed the potential iGEMers among students of various majors besides science in Hong Kong,  which can help iGEM to build up a better reputation and higher impact on synthetic biology in Asia region. Also, we proposed a new biosafety approach (exploiting the natural bacterial immune defend mechanism on digestion of target engineered DNA), which can further help in higher standard of safety in synthetic biology.

Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts, please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
Best new BioBrick part (natural): None
Best new BioBrick part (engineered): BBa_K786002
Best improved part(s): None
List any other parts you would like the judges to examine: None
Please explain briefly why the judges should examine these other parts:
We make this engineered part by fusion of various biobricks with different functions to be a unit for our specific function (sense specific wavelength spectrum for cell movement)

iGEM Safety
For iGEM 2011 teams are asked to detail how they approached any issues of biological safety associated with their projects.
The iGEM judges expect that you have answered the four safety questions on your iGEM 2011 wiki.

Attributions and Contributions
For iGEM 2011 the description of each project must clearly attribute work done by the team and distinguish it from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, and instructors.
