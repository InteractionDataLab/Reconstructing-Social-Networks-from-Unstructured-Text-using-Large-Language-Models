CH2.2.3 - HEALTH & MEDICINE
“Many health and medical problems might best be addressed by improved biological technologies. What can synthetic biology do?”
Example:
There are not enough organ donor for patients with organ failure, and with the shortage, the donated organs are expensive. Organs are formed by the various combinations of 4 different kinds of tissues: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial; and they are groups of cells.
The project, Tissue-by-Design was an exploitation of this basic structure of human body. The mechanisms of the tissue and organ formation could be engineered in different aspects: cell-cell communication pathways, intracellular information processing circuits, and cell-cell adhesion, thus the undifferentiated cells are control to synthesize desire organs by the respect pattern.
