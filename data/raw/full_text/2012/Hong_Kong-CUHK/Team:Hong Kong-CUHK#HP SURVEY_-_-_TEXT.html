SURVEY ANALYSIS
Being the participants in iGEM, we can hardly see the perspectives of others who barely know sciences. The surveys were conducted to understand different perspectives of students who may have the chance to join iGEM. Our target does not only include university fellows but also high school juniors in Hong Kong as iGEM high school has been introduced. In details, they can be separated into two age groups: 15-17, and 18-25 years old. We hoped to find out the suitable approaches of human practice toward our targets. Surveys for high school students were taken as questionnaires before and after a talk or workshop, and the undergraduates took theirs online through social network.
