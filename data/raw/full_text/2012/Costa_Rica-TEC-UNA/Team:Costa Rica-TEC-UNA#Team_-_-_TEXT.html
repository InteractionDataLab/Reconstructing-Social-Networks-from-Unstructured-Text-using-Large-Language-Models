Ricardo Alvarado Meza
Also known as Richie, he is a 22 years old senior student of Biotechnology Engineering at ITCR. From Cartago, Ricardo is also considered a Professional Geek. He is interested in synthetic biology, bionanotechnology, bioinformatics, tissue engineering and pharmacogenetics, but also likes to read science fiction and fantasy books, eat, watch anime, read manga, eat, solve all kinds of puzzles, eat, try on new programs and eating. Seriously, he eats a lot with tons of lemon juice on it.
He's developed various theories, among which we can name Quantum theory of female behavior, the Unified theory on the wood, nails, thumbtacks and others and the Theory of random thinking. With lots of patience, he's a 9gagger that loves science, his computer, lemon juice and miso soup. He is also known for being a parasite that feeds from other's food... and of other people.
David García Gómez
He is a mistery. Believes in Anarchy, has extremely long hair and is known for saying 'yare-yare'. Also, he has an almost unhealthy obsession about Pennywise, the IT clown.
Jorengeth Abad Rodríguez Rodríguez
Known as Don Abad, he is a Golfito native with a degree in biology with emphasis on biotechnology from UNA Among his areas of interest we can find microbial biotechnology, production of metabolites, bioprospecting, bioinformatics and industrial production.
Likes strategy games, fishing, learning fun facts, random books, exploring, swimming y sometimes cooking. For some reason, he always seems happy.
Verónica Delgado Hernández
She is known as Vero or "La Vero", is 23 years old and comes from Heredia. A TEC graduate, has a bachelor degree in  Biotechnology engineering. Among her areas of interest there's synthetic biology, genetic engineering, molecular biology, microbial biotechnology, entrepreneurship, and finally, intellectual property.
Loves reading novels, watching movies, working out and walking, traveling, cooking and eating good food, besides thinking and thinking and memory games.
It is said she sleeps a lot, and at first glance she appears to be serious, but is also a matter of knowing her.

Likes playing basketball, the beach, the countryside, and reading under the shade of a tree.
Gets a little stressed over cleaning.
Jazmin Meza Torres
Known as Jaz, she’s 21 and lives in Cartago. Another TEC's Biotechnology Engineering student. She likes immunology, bioprocesses, microbiology and obviously synthetic biology.
Her hobbies are reading, listening to music, running, go to the gym, dancing and traveling to the mountain or the beach.
Is maybe the only vegetarian in our group (because of her appreciation to the animal life), she also likes to meditate to relax her mind and body. She is a braider master and the cosmetic supplier for the iGEM girls.

A 23rd years old Biotecnologist, as well an Industrial Chemistry student at UNA. He lives at Alajuela. His academic prefrerences are related to microbiology, enzimology, development of new substrates for bioprocessing, between others.
He likes to dance, listen to music, watch movies and spend qualitity time with his friends. He loves to taste new food dishes.
Johan Morales Sánchez
20 year old TEC's Biotechnology Engineering student and a beginner microbiology student of UCR. He comes from Naranjo and is interested on tissue engineering, genetics, microbiology and almost anything related to biomedicine.
He simple loves doing nothing, waste some time as much as he loves to eat ice cream, brownies, chocolate or any other sweet treat. When he cooks pots spontaneously fire up and electroninc devices usually get broken in his hands, specially cellphones.
He was a Boy Scout for a long time and he doesn’t like to be touched by people.
Wendy Bryan Quirós
Also known as Wen, she is 20 and is in her last year of TEC's Biotechnology Engineering career. She is from Siquirres and is interested on bioprocesses, microorganisms, bioprocesses with microorganisms and microorganisms on a bioprocess!!
She likes to read, to watch movies and TV series. She loves Benedetti and enjoys small things in life. Her favorite movies are Amelie and, Charlie and the chocolate factory even thus she doesn’t like chocolats. She doesn’t like butterflies either.
She doesn’t like people who doesn’t greet, drones nor terror histories; loves Harry Potter, cows and gnomes. She is great imitating other people.
Naizmi Valverde Porras
Her name is a little bit uncommon and hard to pronounce the first time so she's been called all kinds of "variants", including Nashville, Neshmi, Nezmi, Neizimi... but her friends usually call her Naiz. Another TEC student, and as the ones before her, also an Engineering in Biotech student. She´s 21 and is mainly interested in Microbiology, Nanotechnology, and Molecular Biology.
Loves sheep, stuffed animals, her dog Lily, videogames, anime, books, independen films, music and chess. Hates cockroaches. She says there are an internal obese person and also an internal anorexic person, both of them always causing her moral conflicts. She's continously apologizing...and did I already mentioned that she HATES cockroaches?

Silence is one of the many things that bothers her, so she's always saying random useless facts to fill the silence, and gets unreasonably nervous when it's her time to speak in front of an audience.
Most of the people think she's not a very nice person at first, because of her shyness,but after getting to know her better she's an outgoing, funny and nice person. But not when she's angry...
Asdrúbal Mayorga Lamas
Everybody calls him 'Compañero'. From Bagaces, Guanacaste, he's a 22-year-old student on TEC's Biotechnology Engineering career. His main interests are Molecular Biology, Bioprecesses, Plant Tissue Culture and Microbiology.
He enjoys swimming, running, reading, playing badminton, aviation, traveling, dogs and being on the beach with the sound of waves and the sea breeze.
