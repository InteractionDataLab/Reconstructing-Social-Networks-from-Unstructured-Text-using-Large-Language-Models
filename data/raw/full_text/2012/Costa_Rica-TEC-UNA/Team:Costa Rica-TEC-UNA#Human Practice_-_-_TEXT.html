For Human Practices we looked for the release of information from the most basic concepts of science and biology to more complex concepts of biotechnology, molecular biology, transformation, synthetic biology and what is about our project addressed to people that are not so related with the concept. Also we set out to promote for other students in high schools and other universities for them to participate with new projects for iGEM in representation of our country. To accomplish this objective we made expositions, classes and conferences of these subjects for 10th grade high school students of the Scientific High School of Cartago, for the teachers of the faculty of biology, for pharmacy students of the University of Costa Rica and for different career students, teachers and investigators in the Biology Week organized by the faculty of biology in the National University (UNA).
