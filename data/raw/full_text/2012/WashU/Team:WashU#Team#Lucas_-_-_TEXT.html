Lucas Harrington
After watching Life Aquatic at the age of 7.43, Lucas convinced his parents to convert his family's swimming pool to a sanctuary for cuttlefish. However, being from St. Louis the transport of cuttlefish from the nearest ocean resulted in the death of more than 90% of the specimens.  As a result Lucas was forced to eat cuttlefish every night, leading to its becoming his favorite food.   Now a Senior majoring in biochemistry, raising cuttlefish has transitioned to being his #2 hobby.
