Peter Zhu
Peter was accompanied by a turtle for almost ten years during his childhood. He would like to let his turtle enjoy the aroma of saffron. He is a senior with Biomedical Engineering major and Electrical Engineering minor. Possibly, he will take linguistics as his second minor. He is a pre-med. Ocean blue is his favorite color and circle is his favorite shape. He likes swimming, taking photos, playing military chess, hiking, biking and traveling. His favorite food is stir-fry and his favorite drink is coconut juice. He likes the song “Teenage Dream” by Katy Perry.
