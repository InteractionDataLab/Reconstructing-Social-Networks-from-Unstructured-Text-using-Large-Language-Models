Team:WashU/mobile/Team/Brian
From 2012.igem.org
Born under the faint glow of the moon at the end of the winter solstice, Brian was abandoned at birth and raised by an old mother wolf, leading to his current obsession with the cool canines. A rising sophomore, Brian intends to major in biology (Pre-Med, of course) at WashU. He doesn't rely on iTunes too much, but has found that he listens to a lot of Coldplay. Currently, his number 2 song on iTunes is Paradise, by Coldplay.
