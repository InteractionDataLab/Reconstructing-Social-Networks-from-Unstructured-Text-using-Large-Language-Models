We gave a PowerPoint presentation complete with videos and useful information to keep the children engaged while providing them with an understanding of concepts about DNA and basic genetic engineering. A Prezi containing most of the powerpoint to be shown can be found on the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:WashU/YLC">Overview Page</A>. The full PowerPoint can be found <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/igem.org/f/f2/YLC_Project_Presentation2.pdf">here</A> as a .pdf under 2MB on the iGEM site. A larger.pptx can be found on our <A href="http://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByOQoDVkzlgwb1J2WUw1NnhreVU/edit">Google Drive</A>.

In the lesson, we exposed the children to topics that are not found in the normal 6th to 8th grade curriculum. We first gave a brief introduction into the cell and DNA to give a background of genetic engineering is. We discussed biology in a pleasant and interactive environment with fun, interesting facts and questions along the way. We talked about how DNA holds a code for the formation of proteins that do the jobs of the cell, how the DNA in humans is very similar to many other organisms' DNA and the universal codon code, and asked questions along the way.

We covered case studies of genetic engineering research to shed realistic light on the apparent unlimited potential of genetic engineering. Our cases included: biofuels, insulin production, and GMO crops. After viewing the cases, we had groups of students brainstorm in a poster board activity in which they invented genetically engineered creations that can be as fantastical as the Mockingjay in ''The Hunger Games''.

After the YLC students presented their brainstorming ideas, we gave a brief demonstration of our project in ''Synechocystis'' and ''E. coli'' that we chose after we brainstormed ourselves and decided a project to work on. Further details about our ''Synechocystis'' project can be found under the Saffron project labels above. We gave the reasons why we believed developing a biosynthetic route for forming Saffron and allowed the students to guess at the price a pound of Saffron can currently fetch. Next, we showed what we are doing to make that goal realized and show what results we have at the time of the demonstration.

After sitting through a little lesson, we did an experiment with the students to give them a hands-on activity. Before arrival, the students' parents completed a waiver to allow for an experiment with potentially harmful materials. We provided each student with 4 vials each containing a different fluorescent protein: green (GFP) and red (RFP). These colors are the constructs that we biobricked together in our experiment phase of this project. Each student was provided gloves and two LB-amp plates to draw a design as well as applicators to transfer the cells. We stood by with spill kits to clean up any messes, keeping the area clean. After the students were done plating, we collected the plates to bring back to our incubator for two nights.

When we returned two days later, we showed the students their plates under UV in a dark box with UV glasses to minimize exposure to any damaging UV. We also photographed each of the plates to give the students since it would not be permissible to allow the students to return home with recombinant ''E. coli''. We allowed any students who wished to present their plates to the group the time to show all present.

Before leaving we answered any questions the students had about genetic engineering and the sciences and asked the students to complete a survey on their interest levels in pursuing a career in the biological sciences or engineering and to gauge interest  in our demonstration and ask for constructive criticism. The results was only used in our group and not posted publicly to ensure the privacy of the students who participated.

We would like to thank the Youth Learning Center in the Central West End in St. Louis for their commitment to &quot;the youth from underserved communities to inspire lifelong learning, social responsibility, and moral leadership&quot; as they state on their website. We would like to also thank them for their generosity in allowing us to enter their community to give our genetic engineering demonstration.
