Future Work
Washington University in Saint Louis has a history of volunteer activities at The Youth Learning Center (YLC) in the Central West End in Saint Louis. Many WashU students function as volunteer mentors, tutors, or assistants at the YLC. This year's WashU iGEM team will be traveling to the YLC to give a demonstration, lesson, experiment, and survey to a group of 6th through 8th graders.  We will end with a survey to gain knowledge of the kids' interest in the study of the sciences, how informative they found our presentation, and how it can be improved in their eyes.
