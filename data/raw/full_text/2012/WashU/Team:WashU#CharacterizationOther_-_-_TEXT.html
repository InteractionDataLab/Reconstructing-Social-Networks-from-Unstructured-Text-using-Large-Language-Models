Phase III
The purpose of Phase III is to complete the production of safranal and crocin by putting together the biobricks from Phase II.In anticipation for the final biobrick which will contain all of our genes together in one plasmid, we created a variety of standardization curves to compare yield and calculate important constants. For example, we made a standard curve of crocin in water to calculate its extinction coefficient.
Using the trendline below, by the Beer-Lambert law, the extinction coefficient of crocin in water is 15258 M-1 cm-1.
