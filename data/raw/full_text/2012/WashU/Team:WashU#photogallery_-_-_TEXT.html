Mission Statement
The ultimate goal of the University of Illinois 2012 iGEM team is to construct an RNA based protein scaffold to use in the optimization of multi-step enzymatic pathways like that involved in the production of Piceatannol from less complex molecules. We aim to improve the versatility and cost efficiency of biological production systems by use of our PUF project RNA scaffold and to prove its viability through the implementation of such a system in our PHAT project's Piceatannol production in E.Coli.
PROJECT PUF
This project is focused on creating and optimizing a construct for the production and customization of the PUM protein. In doing so, our team is looking to standardize the method in which the RNA binding protein can be used as a toolkit in Biobrick format. With a toolkit we hope to produce utility with biological parts while following the philosophies of engineering. This toolkit will then be used in various ways to further control distinct aspects of anything involving RNA. In doing so, we also seek to utilize such properties, zinc fingers, and RNA stem loops to create a protein scaffolding system based on RNA.
PROJECT PHAT
The project dubbed "PHAT" has its focus on a metabolite of the widely studied chemical, Resveratrol. The metabolite of Resveratrol, Piceatannol has recently been discovered to have unique properties which can be heavily utilized in pharmaceutical industries as it has demonstrated an ability to inhibit adipogenesis. Our team seeks to integrate the disciplines of synthetic biology with aspects of chemical engineering to find efficient ways to produce and improve upon Piceatannol production. We hope to utilize the scaffolding system we will have developed to optimize the final results of project PHAT.
