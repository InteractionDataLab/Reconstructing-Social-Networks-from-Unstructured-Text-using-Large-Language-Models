His favorite recent TV series has been Hatfields & McCoys on the History Channel. He says the best food in the world is his mom’s banana bread. His favorite color is sky blue, and most importantly, his second favorite hobby is hiking.  He chose the dolphin as his animal after being inspired by the hydroplaning dolphins found in this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6yzpe8r4xg .
