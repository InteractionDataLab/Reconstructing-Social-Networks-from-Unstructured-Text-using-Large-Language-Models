Overview
Our project consisted of three different phases.
Phase 1: Produce zeaxanthin in our two chosen organisms (E. coli and Synechocystis).
Phase 2: Overproduce the two genes needed for the conversion of zeaxanthin to crocin and safranal (ZCD and UGTCs2 proteins).
Phase 3: Synthesize crocin in vivo and characterize its production
