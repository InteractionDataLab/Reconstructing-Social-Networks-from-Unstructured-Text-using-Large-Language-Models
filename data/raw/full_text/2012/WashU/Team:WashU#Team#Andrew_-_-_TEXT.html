Andrew Ng
Andrew Ng is a sophomore majoring in Biomedical Engineering from San Diego, California. His favorite food is the California Burrito, which is a San Diegan delicacy consisting of carne asada, guacamole, cheese, and most importantly French Fries, all wrapped in a warm tortilla. He chose the manatee as his favorite animal because he too dreams of conquering the world one day, and plans to use our saffron producing bug to achieve his goal. As a soundtrack to the conquest, he plans to play Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries”. When he is not using iGEM to further his aspirations for world domination, he enjoys playing water polo for Washington University.
