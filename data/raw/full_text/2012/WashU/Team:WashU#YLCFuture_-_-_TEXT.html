Future of iGEM Outreach
In order to ensure that outreach is an integral part of future iGEM endeavors, we have established a working relationship with the Young Scientists Program (YSP) at Washington University in St. Louis. This program, run by graduate students, implements multiple activities in the local St. Louis community. This partnership with YSP will guarantee that iGEM becomes more involved in the St. Louis community, allowing the team to expand the influence of synthetic biology in Missouri.
