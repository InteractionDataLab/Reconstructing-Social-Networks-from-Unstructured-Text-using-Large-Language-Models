Phase 1
In this phase, we produced the precursor to our project, zeaxanthin, in E. coli using a biobrick submitted by the Tokyo Tech iGEM team of 2010. After successfully inserting the genes into our cells, we then characterized this biobrick by optimizing the conditions required for sufficient cell growth and expression of zeaxanthin, as seen on our characterization page .
Phase 2
To successfully produce the components of saffron - i. e. crocin and safranal - it is necessary to ensure that the genes required produce their proper proteins. To do this, we grew up cell cultures, extracted the proteins from the cultures, and then ran SDS-PAGE gels to identify the proteins produced. Using this method, we clearly identified that our genes were properly producing their proteins.
Phase 3
To finish off the project, we wanted to actually make the red crocin and safranal, and then characterize production of these components in our cells. Due to time constraints, we were unable to finish the entirety of this phase and create our final desired product, as seen on this page , but we were still able to successfully clone in and express the genes necessary to take this final step. With more time, this project could be brought to completion.
