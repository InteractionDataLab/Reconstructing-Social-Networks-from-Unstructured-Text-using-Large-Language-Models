Trypsin Digestion for LC/MS
Make, run, stain and destain SDS-PAGE gel as usual.  Note: If protein is not being overproduced, purification may be necessary to give a clear band.
Excise protein band to be investigated using a razor blade.  Following excision,  mince this band into 0.5mm cubes and place in a low-bind eppendorf tube.
Destain gel pieces by adding 200ul of 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 40% acetonitrile and incubating for 30min at 37degrees
Repeat step 3 once more.
Dry gel pieces using a speed-vac for 30min.
Add 20 μl (0.4 μg of trypsin) of rehydrated trypsin to the tube.
Add 50 μl of 40 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 9% acetonitrile to the gel sample and mix.
Incubate mixture overnight.
The peptide pieces are now in the solution is now ready analyze by LC/MS. Simply remove the liquid, carefully avoiding the gel pieces.
