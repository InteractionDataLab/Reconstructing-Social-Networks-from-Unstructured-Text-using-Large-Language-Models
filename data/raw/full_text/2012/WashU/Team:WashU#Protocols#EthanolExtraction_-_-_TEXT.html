Caroteinoid Extraction
Take the requisite volume of culture wanted for extraction. The more culture you use, the more cells you will have. Start by taking 1 ml of culture and place it into an Eppendorf tube.
Spin the culture down for 1 minute at 12,000 RPM
Remove supernatant.
Repeat steps 1 to 3 until you have pelleted the requisite amount of cells.
Now, resuspend pelleted cells in .5 mL of ethanol. Spin for 1 minute at 12,000RPM.
Save the supernatant, as it now contains the carotenoids. If the pellet is still colored, repeat step 5, saving the supernatant, until the pellet is white or until you are satisfied with the amount of carotenoids extracted.
