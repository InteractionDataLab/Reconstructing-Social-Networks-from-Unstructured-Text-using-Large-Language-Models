WashU iGEM 2012 takes gold at Americas East Jamboree!!!!!!
For all WashU students interested in joining the iGEM team of 2013, the application can be found here . We will accept applications until February 15, 2013.
Project Abstract
For over a millennium, saffron has stood as the most expensive spice in the world, mostly due to the incredible amount of work required to extract the spice from the crocus flower.
Our iGEM team aims to produce saffron in the bacterium E. coli, in order to create an inexpensive alternative to the current method of manufacturing the spice. This project, named Saffron in a Kan, will seek to first express the genes necessary for the three main components of saffron - picrocin, crocin, and safranal - and then to optimize the output of these three components.
A secondary goal for our team is to produce the above components in Synechocystis, a cyanobacterium, as well, to see if our biobrick can be used in more than one bacterium as well as to compare yield.
