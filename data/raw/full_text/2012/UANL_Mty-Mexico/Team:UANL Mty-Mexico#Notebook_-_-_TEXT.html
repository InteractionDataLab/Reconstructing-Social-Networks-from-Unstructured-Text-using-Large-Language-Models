Cloning Strategy
Fusion proteins
We used a cloning strategy similar to the Standard Assembly 21, based on the compatible restriction sites BglII and BamHI. Briefly, a scar is obtained which translation results in the benefical amino acids glicine and serine (Figure 1). In contrast with the Standar Assembly 21, the XhoI site was replaced with a SpeI site, which allows us to use the Standard Assembly 10 backbones.

For the rest of the constructs Standard Assembly 10 was used. Check our results on the "wet lab" tab.
