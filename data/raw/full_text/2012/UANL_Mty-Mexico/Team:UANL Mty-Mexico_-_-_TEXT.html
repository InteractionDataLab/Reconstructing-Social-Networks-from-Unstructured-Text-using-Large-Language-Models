Overview

We are the representative team for iGEM 2012 from Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, México.  We are at iGEM to support and perform Synthetic Biology. This is our wiki, through which you can get to know better what we do.
FEATURED
Synthetic Biology Tunnel
A project to massively inform the crowd. In about 90 minutes and across ten interactive modules, we covered topics from basic molecular biology to applications of SynBio and iGEM. More than 2000 attendees!
E.cologic
Our project, E. cologic, addresses a severe health public issue through an environmentally friendly, scalable biological device.
iGEM History Database
The database is a freely accessible iGEM compilation that can inspire new projects! This year, we collaborated with Dr. Michal Galdzicki, from University of Washington, to generate a new interface.
Math Model
Whenever possible, we will make a model in an unicellular, genetic circuit level; but usually, we'll be modeling in a population level.
Human Practices
Let us start with a great story: speeches, workshops, tunnel, courses, CIDEB-UANL, posters, TV, radio...All together, it was a once in a life-time experience!
