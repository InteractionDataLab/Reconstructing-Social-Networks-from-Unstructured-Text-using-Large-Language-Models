Modeling: genetic-circuit level approach
The second approach is divided in four modules, all of which intend to describe different parts of the E. cologic system taking into account molecular kinetic constants and gene expression models for the proteins involved.
The four modules of the genetic circuit level approach are:
Arsenic transport – this will be a model that describes the movement of arsenic across the cell membrane, which takes into account the kinetic constants of the interaction with the arsenic transporter.
Arsenic accumulation – this model will describe the sequestration of arsenic inside the cell as a result of the interaction with the proteins ArsR and the metalothionein.
Biosensor – a classical switch-like model that produces a reporter protein in direct proportion to the concentration of an input, which in this case is arsenic.
Silica binding – a model that describes the interaction between the membrane-embedded chimeric protein with the silica binding domain and the silica particles.
