Modeling
Beside the experimental work we did for our project "E.cologic", we also developed some theoretical models.
These models can be divided in two main categories:
Mathematical model (a deterministic, ODE model).
Protein structure model (simulations for the prediction of the structure of the proteins involved in our system).
