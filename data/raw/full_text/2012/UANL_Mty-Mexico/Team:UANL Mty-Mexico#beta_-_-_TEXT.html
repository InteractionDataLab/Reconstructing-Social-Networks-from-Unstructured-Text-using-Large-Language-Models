We are the representative team from Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, México.  We are at iGEM to support and perform synthetic biology. This is our wiki, trough which you can get to know better what we do.
Synthetic Biology Tunnel
Our mission: take Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology to people of all ages in a massive diffusion event.
On the radio!
We mean the "massive". We hope to inform as many people as we can, as we know education is the only way to build a founded, critic judgment.
Under construction!
Sorry that drawing is the best I could do... Anyways, our Wiki is under construction and we will soon add more content!
