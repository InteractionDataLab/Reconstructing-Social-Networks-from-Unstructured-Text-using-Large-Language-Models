Collaboration
Synthetic Rally
In order to achieve better results, we collaborated with the CIDEB-UANL_Mexico team for iGEMhs2012 while doing the Synthetic Rally activity.  Collaboration allowed us to reach better results, organization was the key for success, but above that, it was an amazing team work. We could set different teams in order to give the talks and to set and keep the logistics while the Rally was being performed.
iGEM-MX collaboration network
On August 10, 2012, all the iGEM teams from Mexico were called to make a reunion in order to talk about their projects and to discuss about common problems for iGEM teams in this country. This reunion took place in Irapuato, Gto. Mexico at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (CINVESTAV).
iGEM teams presented their main problems, above them there are troubles with customs. These teams decided to make a collaboration network in order to look for solutions to these problems and to achieve better results as teams through collaboration. Among the resolutions that were taken there are to look for institutions that could help us with customs troubles, to standardize the lab protocols among the teams and to make a database for the Registry Parts that we usually get with functional troubles, thus we can look into our parts in order to analyze if there is a general problem or not.
Construction of the Synthetic Biology Tunnel
While we were setting up the Synthetic Biology Tunnel we needed so much help, so we invited the other two teams from our University: the iGEMhs team CIDEB-UANL_Mexico and the iGEMe team UANLe_Mexico. They were helping us with the construction of all the materials needed for this project, and also they helped us while performing the Tunnel, with expositions and logistics.
Dr. Michal Galdzicki
Dr. Michal Galdzicki from the University of Washington help us to improve our iGEM project database in our Bio! Blog, so we could get a better interface, more friendly and easier to use.
