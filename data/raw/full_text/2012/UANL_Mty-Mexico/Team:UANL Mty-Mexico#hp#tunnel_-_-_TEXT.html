Synthetic Biology Tunnel
The Synthetic Biology (SynBio) Tunnel is a project to massively inform the crowd. We gave people  of all ages accurate information to understand what SynBio is and how it is carried out. In about 90 minutes and across ten interactive modules, we covered topics from basic molecular biology  to applications of SynBio and iGEM. Our objective is to educate people in the area in order to promote a founded, critic judgment. Voilà a glance at the tunnel modules:
1: DNA
Topics: -DNA as the information storage molecule in all living things. -Organization of DNA within cells. -Molecular structure of DNA -DNA structure model. Activity: Puzzle board game to learn how DNA is copied.
2: Genes
Topics: -Genes as functional units of DNA -Organization and parts of a genes -How do the genes work? -Central dogma of molecular biology.  Activity: Puzzle with multiple options to explain gene function through the central Dogma. -Use of common examples.
3: Proteins
Topics: -Proteins as carriers of most biological processes -Types of proteins -Examples of  common proteins -The genetic code  Activity: Build a protein from DNA code (translation), Protein models.
4: Genetic Engineering
Topics: -Recombinant DNA technology -Restriction enzymes, ligase and vectors -Examples.  Activity: Build a recombinant DNA molecule with colored cables  and transform a cell.
5: Synthetic Biology
Topics: -Universality, modularity and abstraction of bioparts -Synbio as the application of engineering concepts to biology -Advancements in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies. Activity:  Construct a genetic circuit on a board and estimate time and costs to build it.
6: Biobricks
Topics: -BioBricks as standard DNA parts - Parts of a BioBrick - Types of BioBricks. -Biobrick assembly -The Registry of Standard Biological Parts Activity: Put compatible bricks together.
7: Biological machine
Topics: -Imagine the possibilities -Addressing high impact problems through biomachines. -Metabolic load -Advantages of biomachines over robots. Activity: "Labyrinth of metabolism" so that the visitor knows that "parts" must be manipulated to make a organism perform certain function.
8: Applications of SynBio
Topics: -Impact of SynBio in a wide variety of areas - Examples of issues solved through SynBio (How do these projects work?)  Activity: The visitor must correlate a specific genetic circuit to its application area.
9: iGEM
Topics: iGEM as the biggest synthetic biology competition, rules, motivation, scope. - iGEM UANL 2011 and 2012 -CIDEB-UANL 2012  Activity: -Explain our 2011 project -Exhibition of the light-machine used in our project -Explain CIDEB's 2012 project
10: Ethics and Biosafety
Topics: -Ethics definition -Human quality of life -Good and ugly -Impact awareness -Acceptance of SynBio -Potential problems -Precautions taken to prevent them -Biosafety levels Activity: Dress with biosafety equipment  (lab coat, glasses, gloves…) as fast as possible!
Tunnel’s dynamic and logistics
As regards the structure and accommodation, given the name Synthetic Biology Tunnel, it had a tunnel-like structure and accommodation, making it straight off so visitors began their tour of an end and finished on the other, visiting each module alternately. Likewise, a set of semi-arches structures gave a general form of tunnel, so the visitor could easily be placed in this tunnel that was touring, also allows identify all modules that belong to the same activity.
To make this event possible it used the facilities of the School Biological Sciences at Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon.
School groups were invited; a group was coming every half hour. They were greeted, and given a talk about the tunnel, biotechnology in general and its benefits, as well as a practical demonstration of an extraction of banana’s DNA. The visitors were organized in groups of 10-12 visitors, they were guided and given an explanation of each module and asked to participate in the activities. In the end of the Tunnel the groups were guided to a second room where they can take pictures with the “signs” of the tunnel, could access to the gift shop and write in a “wall” your opinion about the Synthetic Biology Tunnel.
Diffusion and image
As for the event image, it had a “road tunnel” theme, so all information, activities, signage, broadcast and advertising was performed using the colors, shapes and patterns found in traffic signals.
This theme was used to launch and advertising campaign in different areas of the city of Monterrey, including different faculties of Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, other Universities, as well as public places like Fundidora Park and some malls. This campaign was based in attend this places with the signals, to wake curiosity of citizens, we took photos of people with the signals and shared via social networks, to reach a greater number of people. Also in the opening of the event invited press attend to the event.

Impact
* The Synthetic Biology tunnel lasted 19, 20 and 21 of September where we formed and trained about 80 students of various categories in order to perform tasks of speakers and staff.
* During the 3 day exhibition we received more than 2,000 visitors, during the first Synthetic Biology tunnel edition unprecedented in the Monterrey metropolitan area.
* Just over 15 different schools took their students to learn more about synthetic biology, among students were seen many people in middle and high schools.
* During the Tunnel, the local newspaper "El Norte" came to interview us and perform a detailed note about the event.
* The local television "Televisa" came to interview some of the SynBio Tunnel organizers to make a television report.
National Science Week
*The Synthetic Biology Tunnel was repositioned within another event in the public park Niños Heroes in  Monterrey where over 5,000 people attended.
* At the end of the Synthetic Biology  tunnel,  we received several invitations to carry out exhibitions of the same subject in two different schools, one conference, one museum and a recommendation to start moving the Synthetic Biology tunnel through different states of the Mexican Republic .
* During the National science week, the local television "Info Azteca 7" came to perform a extensive note about the event.
Surveys
In order to know basic information of the people who attended this event and their background in biology and biotechnology as well, we decided to apply a simple survey before starting the tunnel. The questions of this survey were design  to know about the age, academic grade, and the field of interest of the people who answered it.
A second survey was applied at the end of the tunnel, with questions regarding to the level of satisfaction of the visitors. These questions aimed to know some important aspects about the quality of the event, so that, it can be improved for further editions. Surveys Results Here
Guided Tours
Thanks to the good diffusion created for the tunnel in social networks, some teams and other people from around the world were interested in the event. For this reason we decided to make guided tours in different languages​​. Enjoy them!
