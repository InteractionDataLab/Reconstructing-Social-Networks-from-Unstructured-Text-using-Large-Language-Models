Results/Outreach The Synthetic Biology tunnel lasted 19, 20 and 21 of September where we formed and trained about 80 students of various categories in order to perform tasks of speakers and staff. During the 3 day exhibition we received more than 2,000 visitors, during the first Synthetic Biology tunnel edition unprecedented in the Monterrey metropolitan area. Just over 15 different schools took their students to learn more about synthetic biology, among students were seen many people in middle and high schools. National Science Week The Synthetic Biology Tunnel was repositioned within another event in the park Niños Heroes in  Monterrey where over 5,000 people attended. At the end of the Synthetic Biology  tunnel  we received several invitations to carry out exhibitions of the same subject in two different schools, one conference, one museum and a recommendation to start moving the Synthetic Biology tunnel through different states of the Mexican Republic .
