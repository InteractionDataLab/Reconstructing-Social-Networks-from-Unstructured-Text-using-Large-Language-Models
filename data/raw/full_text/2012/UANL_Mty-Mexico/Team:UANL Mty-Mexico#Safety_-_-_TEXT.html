We know biosafety measures must be inherent to any synthetic biology project. Through these questions we hope to solve any doubts concerning our project's safety:
Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of: researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
