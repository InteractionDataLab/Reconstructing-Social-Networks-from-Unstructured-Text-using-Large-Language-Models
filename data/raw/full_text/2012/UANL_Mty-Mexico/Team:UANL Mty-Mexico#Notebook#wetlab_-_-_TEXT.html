Here we present our most representative results, it includes main electrophoresis gels of the more important genetic contructions, as well as the maps of the vectors
Figure 1. This gel is a partial restriction of the bifasic switch necessary for the HuBac project (iGEM 2011 UANL Mty-Mexico).
Figure 2. Map of the S4-GFP-S1 contruction in the pSB1C3 vector, and a simulation of a digestion with EcoRI and PstI.
Figure 3. Ready for the minipreps! Here are some transformed bacteria cultures, in the right we can see the clone 1 of the 1-3A+L2 genetic construction.
Figure 4. Here's a partial digest of the construction 1-3A+L2 cutted with XhoI.
Figure 5. Positive restriction digest of 1-3A+L2 and 1-3A (pSB1C3) as control vector.
Figure 6. Maps and simulation of restriction digest of p1C3-L2 and pSB1C3, simulation with XhoI.
Figure 7. 600th, not just a regular gel, 10 tracks of Cph8 (photoreceptor), 2 tracks of 1-23L (terminator), 10 tracks of S1TT (genetic contruction of a the first part Biphasic switch and terminator) and a last track of S4-GFP (second part of the Biphasic swith) all of these used for HuBac project.

Figure 21. High-speed double digestion in a microwave at different seconds (tracks 2-4).
Figure 22. Map of pSB1C3-RFP, and a simulation of a digestion with EcoRI and PstI.
Figure 23. A little fragment in an electrophoresis gel, aaaand it's gone.
Figure 24. As you can see, this is what we mean when we say "work optimization".
