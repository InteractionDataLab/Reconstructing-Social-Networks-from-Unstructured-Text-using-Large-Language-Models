Preparation of E. coli Calcium Chloride competent cells
Inoculate a single colony into 5 mL of LB media without any antibiotics and grow overnight at 37 °C with vigorous shaking.
Inoculate 1 mL of the desired strain into 100 mL of fresh LB, use a 500 mL flask.
Incubate at 37 °C with vigorous shaking until 0.3 - 0.4 sideOD600
Put the flask on ice. Pre-chill 50 mL centrifuge tubes and the centrifuge itself at 4°C.
Centrifuge 50 mL of the culture at 8,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 °C.
Remove the supernatant and add 10 mL of cold CaCl2 0.1 M. Vortex until the pellet is resuspended.
Incubate on ice for 30 minutes, shake the tube once in a while.
Centrifuge at 8,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C. Remove the supernatant and add 2 mL of CaCl2 0.1 M. Resuspend carefully using a micropipette.  Keep always on ice.
Mix the two preparations in a tube and store on ice, or use for transformation.
Note: The competent cells can be stored on ice up to two weeks.
Preparation of E. coli Rubidium Chloride competent cells
Inoculate 5 mL of LB broth with DH5α and incubate the culture overnight at 37°C with vigorous shacking.
Use small culture to inoculate 100 mL of LB broth. Incubate at 37°C with shacking until the culture reaches an optical density (OD595) 0.4-0.6.
Transfer to two 50 mL centrifuge tubes.
Spin at maximum speed for 5 minutes at 4°C.
Remove supernatant.
Add 20 mL of TBF1 and resuspend the pellet.
Incubate on ice for 20 minutes.
Pour off supernatant.
Centrifuge 5 minutes at 8000 rpm/4°C.
Resuspend cellular pellet with 4 mL of TBF2.
Place aliquots of 100 µL at -70°C.
Heat-shock transformation of E. coli competent cells
Add 50 µL of Ca+2 competent cells to a pre-chilled centrifuge tube. Keep always on ice until step 4.
Add plasmid DNA (100 ng) or ligation (up to 5 µL) depending on DNA concentration.
Use 1 µL of a 1 ng/µL DNA sample as positive test in a separate tube. It is recommended to use a DNA-free negative test tube as well.
Chill the tube on ice for 20 - 30 minutes.
Expose the reaction mixture to a  42ºC 1 minute heat-shock.
Put the tube on ice for 2 minutes.
Add 200 µL of antibiotic-free LB media.
Incubate at 37ºC for 20 - 30 minutes.
Spread the appropriate quantity of cells (50-200 µL) on selective LB agar plates.
Incubate overnight at 37º C.
The positive plate must have around 1,000 colonies as an optimal (1X106 transformants per µg supercoiled DNA).
Notes: Until heat-shock, handle the tubes from the upper part to avoid warming the cells. Low temperature is critical for successful transformation. Avoid transforming with more than 5 µL of ligation mixture, as ligation buffer may reduce transformation efficiency.
Preparation of Electrocompetent E. coli cells
Inoculate a single colony of E. coli in 5 mL of LB media. Grow overnight or for 5 hours at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm.
Inoculate 2.5 mL of the previous culture in 200 mL of LB media in a 2 L flask. Grow at 37 °C shaking at 300 rpm until the culture reaches an OD of 0.5 - 0.7.
Chill the cells on ice for 10 - 15 minutes and then transfer the cells into a pre-chilled centrifuge bottle.
Centrifuge at 4,200 rpm for 10 minutes at 2 °C (Beckman J-6M).
Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of cold water. Add 200 mL of cold water and mix well. Centrifuge at 4,200 rpm for 10 minutes at 2 °C.
Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet by shaking gently in the remaining liquid volume.
Add 200 mL of cold water, mix well and centrifuge at 4,200 rpm for 20 minutes at 2°C.
Add 20 mL of 10% cold glycerol and mix well. Centrifuge at 4,200 rpm for 20 minutes at 2 °C.
Add 10 mL of 10% cold glycerol to each tube. Resuspend and gather all the content of the tubes in a single tube, centrifuge and remove the supernatant.
Estimate the pellet volume and add an equal volume of 10% cold glycerol. Resuspend the cells.
Divide the final volume into pre chilled tubes  (100 μl) and store at -80 °C.
Note: Pre-chill all the materials that will be in contact with the cells.
Electroporation of E. coli competent cells
Take a tube with 50 µL of electrocompetent E. coli cells, thaw on ice.

Midi preparation of plasmid DNA (AXYPREP ™ PLASMID MIDIPREP KIT)
Collect 30 of overnight LB culture for the preparation of the high-copy plasmid, or 100 mL of overnight LB culture for the preparation of the low copy-plasmid. Centrifuge at 3000X G for 8 minutes to pellet the bacteria. Discard the supernatant. Invert the centrifuge tube on a paper towel for 1 minute to drain off residual medium.
Resuspend bacterial pellet with 4.5 mL of Buffer S1.
a. Make sure that RNase A has been added into Buffer S1.
b. Incompletely resuspension will reduce lysis efficiency, plasmid yield and purity.
Add 4.5 mL of Buffer S2, and mix by gently inverting tube 6-8 times (do NOT vortex)
a. Buffer S3K must be added within 5 minutes.
b. Check the Buffer S2 for precipitation before each use. If precipitation occurs, incubate at 37°C.
Add 4.5 mL Buffer S3K pre-chilled at 4°C, invert the tube 10 times. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
Add 4.5 mL of Buffer B (pre-chilled at 4°C), gently invert the tube 10 times.
Centrifuge at 6000 G for 10 minutes.
Attach the AxyPrep Vacuum Manifold base to a vacuum pump. Position the manifold top with luer-type fittings on the manifold base. Attach a Midiprep Plasmid Column to a complimentary fitting on the manifold top. Make sure that the column is firmly seated.
Transfer supernatant from step 5 to the Midiprep Syringe Filter. Carefully insert the plunger into the syringe filter and push with a steady motion. Discharged the filtrate into the Midiprep Plasmid Column.
Switch on the vacuum source and continue to apply vacuum to the column until lysate remains. Do not turn the vacuum off.
Keep vacuum, add 7 ml of Buffer W1 and draw the solution through the Midiprep Plasmid Column.
Add 8 mL of Buffer W2, and draw through the Midiprep Plasmid Column.
a. Make sure that ethanol has been added into Buffer W2 concentrate

Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Protocol
To be Loaded:
DNA molecular size marker (λ PstI): 2 - 3 μL
Plasmid DNA: 2 - 3 μL
Enzyme restrictions: 10 μL
PCR products: 5 μL
Procedure:
Prepare an agarose gel of the desired concentration (see Agarose gels section).
Add the necessary SB 1X buffer into the electrophoresis tank to cover the gel.
Load the first well with marker, and then load the DNA samples mixed with loading buffer into the wells.
Plug in the anode and cathode cables so that the DNA samples can move through the gel toward the anode.
Run the electrophoresis at 200 volts.
Wait approximately 20 - 30 minutes or until the bromophenol blue reaches the end of the gel and stop the electrophoresis.
Note: DNA moves toward the positive electric field (anode, usually red cable) due to the negative charges.
Agarose gel
Concentration for supercoiled and plasmid DNA: 0.8%
For digestion reaction fragments over 1,000 bp: 0.8%
For digestion reaction fragments below 500 bp: 1.5%
DNA size marker (λ + PstI): Use 2 or 3 μL per gel.
Note: Not needed when running supercoiled DNA samples, like plasmid DNA.
SB buffer 20X
SB (Sodium Borate) electrophoresis buffer, 20X Stock:
In 700 mL of distilled H2O, dissolve 8 gr of NaOH.
Weight 51 of Boric Acid and dissolve ¾ parts in the NaOH solution
Dissolve the remaining Boric Acid until the buffer reach pH 8.0.
Complete to 1 L with distilled H2O and store in a sterile flask.
Note: Use SB 1X as buffer to run agarose gels up to 200 volts
Ethidium Bromide Gel Staining
Dilute the stock to 20 μg/mL in a special container with the gel buffer.
Put the gel into the container.
Let it stain for 3 - 5 minutes.
Take the gel out of the container and soak the stained gel in water for 5 minutes or more to clear background ethidium bromide from the gel.
View the gel under a UV light source or on a UV transilluminator.
Note: If you want to use ethidium bromide, confine its use to a small area of your laboratory. Wear gloves when staining, handle stained gels, and dispose of any waste.
