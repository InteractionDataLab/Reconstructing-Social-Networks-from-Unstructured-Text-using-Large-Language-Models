Daniel Roush
Dr. Mormile
The team owes a big Thank You to the Missouri S&T '''Department of Biological Sciences'''.  The department was kind enough to provide us with equipment and lab space.
Our iGEM team would also like to thank our advisors, Dr. Dave Westenberg and Dr. Katie Shannon.  Our advisors helped the team train new members and provided an endless source of advice for our team.
Finally, we would like to thank our sponsors for financing our research and making this all possible.
