BBa_K877000: Mini CipA coding region
This part codes for a portion of the scaffoldin protein (cipA) from Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome. Two regions of cipA were ligated together to form this part: three type one cohesin regions and a type two dockerin region. A signaling peptide for export of the protein out of the cell is also coded in this part. This part is unfinished; it contains 6 pst1 sites within its coding sequence.
