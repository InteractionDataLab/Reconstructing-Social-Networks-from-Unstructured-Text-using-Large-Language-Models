Attributions
A very big thanks to Dr. Melanie Mormile and Daniel Roush for allowing us to use their anaerobic equipment and showing how to properly use it! A big thanks also to Dr. Westenberg for helping the team design initial primers.
All other lab work was conducted by Missouri Miners team members in the team's lab.
All mathematical modeling of the system was done by our wonderful collaborators, BYU iGEM!
Collaboration
Thank you BYU iGEM for contacting us for collaboration and mathematically modeling our theoretical system to show the increase of efficiency of enzymes on an  extracellular scaffolding system.
