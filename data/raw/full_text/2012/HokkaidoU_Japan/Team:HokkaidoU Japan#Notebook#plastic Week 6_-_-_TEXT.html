Polymer extract
@Taguchi lab
sample1 JM109 culture from July 18th 1.4643 g , 0.0054 (tube+polymer , polymer)
sample2 JM109 culture from July 18th 1.4642 g , 0.0040
sample3 DH5a                         1.4666 g , 0.0056
Preculture
Inoculated from three different plates (Name it 1,2,3).
Cultured in media of LB 150 ul + 1.5 ul of Amp.
30C   August 6th 20:00 ~ 7th 10:00
August 7th
Liquid culture
We made 8 samples to see if Panthotenic acid is necessary for plastic growth.
Panthotenic acid (+)1.5 ml 4 samples
Panthotenic acid (+)0.7 ml 2 samples
Panthotenic acid (-)0.7 ml 2 samples
Incubated liquid culture from August 7th 11:00 until 9th 09:50.
August 9th
@Taguchi lab
Harvest
We did the protocol of harvest on 8 samples.
August 10th
Plasmid extraction
The plasmid of BBa_K342001(PhaC) was extracted by FastGene Plasmid Mini Kit(Nippon Genetics) and we got 50 ul of DNA solutions.
August 11th
Sequencing
BBa_K342001(PhaC) was seqenced.
