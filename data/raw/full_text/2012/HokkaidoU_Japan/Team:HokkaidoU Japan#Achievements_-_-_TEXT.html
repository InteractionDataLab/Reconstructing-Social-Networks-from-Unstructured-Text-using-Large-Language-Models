We had a great summer. Our achievements are shown below.
Medal Requirements
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Regional Jamboree.
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2012 Judging form.
Create and share a Description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
Plan to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Enter information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Including:
Primary nucleaic acid sequence
Description of function
Authorship
Safety notes, if relevant.
Acknowedgment of sources and references
Submit DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry.
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device.
Enter this information and other documentation on the part's 'Main Page' section of the Registry

BBa_K759001, BBa_K759003, BBa_K759004, BBa_K759005, BBa_K759006, BBa_K759007, BBa_K759008, BBa_K759009, BBa_K759010, BBa_K759011, BBa_K759012, BBa_K759013, BBa_K759014
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal: (one OR more)
Improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Experience Page of the Registry.
Part Numbers:
BBa_K342001, BBa_K156015, BBa_K156016
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system. Team:HokkaidoU_Japan/Project/Aggregation
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
Link to this information on your wiki. Team:HokkaidoU_Japan/Project/PHB_Synthesis
iGEM Prizes
Best Human Practice Advance
We are developing "Biobrick Reviews". With using it, you can screen biobricks quickly and can get information directly by other iGEMers.
Best Experimental Measurement
We characterized Ag43 in detail and searched the best condition for E. coli to aggregate each other.
Our Best Parts
Best new BioBrick part (natural):  BBa_K759004
Best new BioBrick part (engineered):  BBa_K759011
Best improved part(s):  BBa_K759005
iGEM Safety
We provide safety information: Team:HokkaidoU_Japan/Safety
