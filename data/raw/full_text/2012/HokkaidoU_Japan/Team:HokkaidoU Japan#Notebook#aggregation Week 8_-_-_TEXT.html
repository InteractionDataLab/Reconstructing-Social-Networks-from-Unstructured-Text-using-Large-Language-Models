Single colony isolation
Single colony isolation of pBAD-RBS-Ag43-dT on pSB1AK3.
Picked up one colony.
Incubated on LBK (dt,RBS,T7) and LBC(pLacI-RBS-Ag43) for 20 hours.
Colony PCR
Colony PCR to confirm that whether the pT7 and RBS was successfully ligated with pSB1C3 or not.

We used N1 (DW only) and N2 (pBAD(containing araC)-RBS on pSB1A3) as controls. Desired product is about 300~400bp.
Colony PCR result
The results showed that ligated DNA has 300 ~ 400 bp and the desired products would have 331bp if it were amplified by 100bp up primer and 200bp down primer. Thus we confirmed that pT7-RBS on pSB1C3 was successfully ligated without no.6,9,10 colonies, but these 3 solution were evaporated because of our mistake. We selected No.4 and 5 colony for liquid culture.

Aggregation check
we cultured the E. coli, which transformed pBAD-RBS-Ag43-dT on pSB1AK3 in LBK. We checked the construct by induction of L-arabinose after 16 hours incubate.
2 ml of liquid culture divided two culture. (made two 1 ml culture)
Added 1 ml LBK in one culture as a negative control.
Added 900 ul LBK and 100 ul 20% L-arabinose.
Incubated at 37C 130 rpm for 2 hrs and 30 min.
Placed tubes on the table at 30 min.
Plasmid extraction
Mni-prep of pT7-RBS on pSB1C3 of colony No. 4 and 5 selected by the result of colony PCR at August 20th. We used Plasmid extraction kit of Nippon genetics: FastGene Plasmid mini kit and finally we eluted the DNA with 20 ul of elution buffer.
File:HokkaidoU2012 120821 pT7-RBS on pSB1C3 ColonyNo. 4,5 mini-prep.jpg
Plasmid extraction result
The concentration of 20 ul of plasmid extraction products were too low to digestion or do something so we retry liquid culture of other number of colony solution: No. 1 and No. 2.
Liquid culture
Liquid culture for Ag43-dT on pSB1AK3 (and pT7-RBS on pSB1C3 colony No. 1 and 2 which were selected from the results of colony PCR).
Added 2 ml of LBA (LBC) into culture tubes.
Resuspended 2 colonies.
Incubated the tubes at 37C for 18 hours (16 hours).

plasmid extraction result
One of Ag43-dT on pSB1AK3 culture did not get muddy. And another one is only a little muddy. We tried plasmid extraction to the latter, we got the 20 ul of DNA solution. And then, we did electrophoresis the plasmid extraction products and (pBAD-RBS and pBAD) gel extract products.

We used N1 (DW only) and N2 (Ag43-dT on pSB1AK3) as controls. Desired product is about 695bp.
Colony PCR result
The results showed that desired DNA were not existed in these picked up colonies. We observed our ethanol precipitation and  electrophoresis result image of ligation products, then noticed that the concentration of each ethanol precipitation product was reversed. This means vector DNA would be self-ligated by the high ratio of molar in ligated DNA solution. We decided to try the DNA synthesis from digestion reaction of vector DNA once more time.
Digestion
Digest vector DNA: pT7-RBS on pSB1C3 by SpeI. Not to leave the plasmid DNA as plasmid DNA, we digested the DNA for 18 hrs.  pT7-RBS on pSB1C3 (SpeI)
