Product:Ag43(K346007)=3120bp and 2070bp
pT7-RBS on pSB1K3=2247bp
We confirmed there are some kinds of restriction enzyme site in K346007 (digested with SpeI, PstI), and pT7-RBS on pSB1K3 was successfully digested with EcoRI and PstI.ãBalance between d+(EcoRI) and d+(E&P:cut with EcoRI and PstI) is about 80bp.

dT(B0015) would be amplifiedãincorrectly and we couldn't get enough digestion product. So we tried another DNA amplification method: PCR then digested.

Liquid Culture
Liquid culture for single colony isolated pT7-RBS on pSB1C3 and Ag43-dT on pSB1T3.
Colonies which have Ag43-dT on pSB1T3 were closely existed so we would picked up two or more colonies.
Picked up one (or tow?) colony from single colony isolated platesãby platinum loop.
Dipped into 2 ml of LBC and LBT.
Incuvated.
July 17th
Ag43-dT on pSB1T3 and pT7-RBS on pSB1C3
Plasmid extraction
Plasmid extraction for Ag43-dT on pSB1T3 and pT7-RBS on pSB1C3 liquid culture products incuvated from yesterday(16th). We used FastGene Plasmid Mini Kit(Nippon Genetics) and got 50 ul of DNA solutions.
Electrophoresis
Electrophoresis for digestion product of K346007(Ag43) with EcoRI and SpeI as a reference to confirm SpeI cuts correct site or not and PstI didn't work correctly(in past experiments). And plasmid extraction products of Ag43-dT on pSB1T3 and pT7-RBS on pSB1C3 also migrated.
If digestion were succeeded, there are two bands would be seen: about 3120bp and 2070bp. And if ligation and transformation, plasmid extraction were succeeded, there would be existed two bands in each lanes: about 5000bp and 2000bp.
Digestion and plasmid extraction result image
From this result we confirmed Ag43 was successfully digested with EcoRI and SpeI, and there were no other extra bands which had been existed double digested with EcoRI & PstI and SpeI & PstI. would PstI not work correctly?
We planed to use dT as vector and Ag43 as Insert. A problem is if dT on pSB1AK3 is used as vector and Ag43 used as insert, we can't select correct Ag43 band in gel extraction phase because DNA bp of Ag43 is nearly same as pSB1AK3. Thus we tried to use  dT on pSB1T3 as vector and Ag43 on pSB1C3 as vector and ligate with standard assembly.
About plasmid extraction products, in Ag43-dT on pSB1T3, there were two plasmid DNA bands about 8000bp and 3000bp in one lane. We thought which means we failed single colony isolation then resuspended two another E.coli colonies another ligated DNA were transformed.  In pT7-RBS on pSB1C3, we needed about 2000bp plasmid DNA and there were about 1500bp of DNA. Plasmid DNA migrates more far than linear DNA so we thought we got correct DNA.
To confirm plasmid extraction products were really ligated correct DNA fragments, first we extracted Ag43-dT on pSB1T3(low bp band) from TBE gel and digested with EcoRI and PstI.
dT Vector plasmid change To use dT as a vector, we needed to change plasmid backbone pAB1AK3 to pSB1T3.
Digestion
Digestion to change the plasmid backbone. Used DNA solution as PCR product(did at 16th) and digestioned pSB1T3 were already exist.

Digestion result
From this digestion results,
Cut with EcoRI,PstI and E&P(EcoRI and PstI) showed different base pair bands compared with d-(digestion minus).
Cut with E&P showed two DNA bands: about 2000bp and 500~1000 bp.
All of digestion products existed lower place than correct band.Correct DNA would show about 5000bp(EcoRI and PstI), 3000bp and 2000bp (E&P).
July 18th
We decided change plasmid backbone of dT pSB1AK3 to pSB1T3.
If we cut Ag43-dT on pSB1AK3 with EcoRI and PstI  to confirm insert DNA, DNA fragment base pair resemble each other(about 3000bp), so then we can't identify them.

Liquid Culture
Liquid culture for single colony isolated(19hrs incubated) Ag43-dT on pSB1T3.
Prepared 2 ml LB.
Added Tet.
Resuspended one colony.
Incuvated 16 hrs.
We decided to start another ligation plan. First we digestion Ag43(K346007) and dT(B0015) with EcoRI&SpeI and EcoRI&XbaI then ligate. Ligation product cut with XbaI&SpeI and HindiIII. HindiIII can cut the site which is exist in pSB1AK3 then we can confirm Ag43-dT(about 3000bp) and pSB1K3(3000bp: cutting fragment will be about 1000bp). Next we digest pT7-RBS on pSB1C3 with SpeI only and ligate X-Ag43-dT-S and S-pSB1C3-pT7-RBS-S. If that go well, we can get pT7-RBS-Ag43-dT on pSB1C3 plasmid DNA which has never been digested with PstI.

Plasmid extraction
Plasmid extraction for Ag43-dT on pSB1T3 and Ag43(K346007) which is inserted in pSB1C3. We used FastGene Plasmid Mini Kit(Nippon Genetics) and got 50 ul of DNA solutions.
Electrophoresis
Electrophoresis for Ag43-dT on pSB1T3[about 5400bp] and Ag43(K346007)[about 5200bp] plasmid extraction products.
plasmid extraction result
From this plasmid extraction result, Ag43-dT on pSB1T3 showed obviously higher DNA band than we estimated. It means Ag43-dT and pSB1T3 were misligated. And Ag43(K346007), we thought Ag43(K346007) DNA band existed in correct area because this DNA has about 5200bp and plasmid DNA migrates more far than linear DNA. Additionally, one weak 10kbp band existed in Ag43(K346007) lane.
Digestion
We conducted two digestion.
Digestion for Ag43(K346007) cut with EcoRI and SpeI. This DNA is for confirmation of PstI restriction enzyme cutting site.
Digestion for Ag43(K346007) and dT(B0015) cut with EcoRI & SpeI and EcoRI & XbaI.
But we cut dT PCR product which didn't have plasmid vector so we retry digestion of dT after.

Digestion result
From this result, we confirmed Ag43(K346007) was successfully digested into two fragments and low concentration of restriction enzyme cause unperfectly cut of plasmid extraction product. But there are correct two bands in Ag43 cutting result so restriction enzyme worked. And about dT digestion, XbaI worked in halfway. We thought this is because we didn't added BSA buffer into dT digestion mix.
And we retried digestion of dT which was  plasmid extraction and gel extracted products. Recipe was same as above(E&X).

Electrophoresis
Electrophoresis for digestion and ligation products yesterday.
Digestion and Ligation results
There are three bands in ligation products(Ag43(7/20) + dT(on pSB1AK3))). Lower band would be digestion result which couldn't be ligated with dT. Middle band would be successfully ligaed DNA which have about 6k bp(Ag43 has 3.1k bp and dT on pSB1AK3 has 3.2k bp). And higher band would make something dimer, we thought.

Digestion result
From this digestion, we confirmed there is at least one PstI cutting site in Ag43 fragment because these digestion results showed same bp and same number of cutting band.
PCR
PCR to confirm how ligated Ag43 fragment(s) with dT on pSB1AK3. We used Ag43 last 700bp area as primer which had designed as sequencing primer. If three (two forward and one reverse )Ag43 were inserted, this primer can anneal to forward Ag43 as forward primer and reverse Ag43 as reverse primer then amplify about 766bp. If there are no reverse Ag43, DNA can't be amplified.
