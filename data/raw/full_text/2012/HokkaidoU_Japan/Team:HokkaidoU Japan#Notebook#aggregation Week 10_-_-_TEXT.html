We confirmed that ptet-RBS-eYFP-dT-pSB1A2 was partially digested and pSTV28 would be successfully digested we think. But we couldn't confirm whether Ag43-dT-pSB1AK3 was digested or not.  We did a gel-extraction of these digested DNA and got 50ul solution of each DNA.

Digestion
We digested plasmid extraction products (pBAD-RBS-Ag43-dT on pSB1AK3) by restriction enzyme. Because I'd like to check the size of insert and vector of getting plasmid.

We estimated the reason is attachment to hydrophobic materials. We incubated in 1 ml of LBA (one contained 1% of L-arabinose, another did not contain L-arabinose) at 37C in glass tubes.
Ethanol precipitation of ptet-RBS-eYFP-dT-pSB1A2 and pSTV28
