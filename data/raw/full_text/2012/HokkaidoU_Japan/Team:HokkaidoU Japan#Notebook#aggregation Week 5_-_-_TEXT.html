Digestion
I tried to digest the plasmid extraction products again, and after Ethanol precipitation, we did electrophoresis.

Transformation
I think that the E. coli which we used transformation is BL21(DE3)pLysS. So, the E. coli could grow on LBC plate.
I'm going to do transformation into DH5α.
Transformation plasmid DNA ligated at 25th (pT7-RBS-Ag43-dT on pSB1K3) into DH5α.
Added 2 ul of plasmid DNA to 50 ul of thawed competent cells on ice.
Incubated on ice for 30 min.
Added 200 ul of LB then incubated the cells for 2 hrs at 37C.
Prepared and Labeled two petri dishes with LBK.
Plate 200 ul of the transformation onto first dish and spread.
Added 450 ul of LB to 50 ul of the transformation and spread 200 ul of it onto second dish.
Incubated the plates at 37C for 14 hrs.
July 31st
Liquid culture
Liquid culture for pT7-RBS-Ag43-dT on pSB1K3.

Resuspended colonies.
Incubated the tubes at 37C for 18 hrs.

From this result, the bottom band was digested incorrectly and middle band was digested correctly, we thought. Was the above band something contaminated in the DNA solution?
Gel extraction
Gel extraction of middle band. We thought this band would be the exactly digested DNA fragment. We used FastGene Gel&PCR extraction kit(NipponGenetics)and got 50 ul of DNA solution.
