We used N1 (DW only) and N2 (Ag43-dt on pSB1K3) as controls. Desired product is about 800~1000bp.
Colony PCR result
From this result, N2 has about 500bp band. We use to liquid culture, No. 7,10,12.
We cultured these DNA in E. coli solution, after added 200 ul LB, at 37C for 3 hrs. Next step, we resuspended these 5 colonies and cultured (add 1800 ul LB and 2 ul Amp) for  hours at 37C.
Transformation
Transformation of BBa_I13453 (pBAD on pSB1A3) into DH5α.
Added 1 ul of plasmid DNA to 50 ul of thawed competent cells on ice.
Incubated on ice for 30 min.
Added 350 ul of LB.
Prepared and Labeled two petri dishes with LBK.
Plate 300 ul of the transformation onto first dish and spread.
Added 450 ul of LB to 50 ul of the transformation and plated 300 ul of it onto second dish and spread.
Incubated the plates at 37C for 19 hours.
Digestion
From sequencing results, we found that we failed to make pT7-RBS on pSB1K3.
So, we tried to make it again.
When the restriction enzyme digest the DNA, it is important for 3A assembry to be digested the target plasmid completely. So, we activated the restriction enzymes for 10 hours.

Ethanol precipitation
Ethanol precipitation for three digestion products.
Added 2 ul of NaoAc, 1.5 ul of glycogen and 50 ul of 100% ethanol.
Centrifuged at 14000 rpm, 30 min at 4C.
Removed supernatant and added 220 ul of 70% ethanol.
Centrifuged at 15000 rpm, 15 min at 4C.
Removed supernatant and dried out at room temperature, after that added 10 ul of DW.
Gel extraction
Before digestion of pBAD-RBS on pSB1A3 and Ag43-dT on pSB1AK3, it is necessary to refine these two DNA. We used FastGene Gel&PCR extraction kit(NipponGenetics)and got 20 ul of DNA solution from 10 ul of plasmid extraction products.
Digestion
Digested pBAD-RBS on pSB1A3 as insert and Ag43-dT on pSB1AK3 as vector with EcoRI and SpeI to make a constract, pBAD-RBS-Ag43-dT on pSB1AK3.
