We couldn't confirm insert DNA were really ligated with Vector or not. Next step, we tried confirmation of insert DNA by electrophoresis of extracted plasmids.  For plasmid extraction, we needed to incubate in liquid culture.
Incubate for plasmid extraction
Prepared 1800 ul LB solutions.
Mixed 200 ul of cultures (suspention were incubated for 2 hrs) and antibiotics(Km (pT7-rbs on pSB1K3), Amp(Ag43-dT on pSB1AK3)).
Incubated for 15 hrs and 30 min.
July 10th
Plasmid extraction
Extracted plasmids from some colonies (we selected colonies which showed more correct bands than other colonies, pT7+RBS were No. 4, 5, 9, 10 colonies and Ag43 + dT were No. 1, 2, 3, 4 colonies)incubated in LBA(Ag43 + dT) and LBK(pT7 + RBS) for 15 hrs and 30 min.
Extracted from LB culturing products by using FastGene Plasmid Mini kit(Nippon Genetics).
Electrophoresis (Used pre-migrated 1% agarose gels with 5 ul EtBr)in 30 min.

To confirm more correctly about insert DNA, we tried to digest these DNA with EcoRI and PstI.
