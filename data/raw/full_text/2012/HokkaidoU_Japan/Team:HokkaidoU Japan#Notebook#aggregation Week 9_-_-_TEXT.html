We did not do digestion of vector DNA sokution, result, because it has only too low concentration to be digested product solution.
We failed PCR again. The digestion result was confirmed that the Insert DNA was successfully digested by XbaI and SpeI. And we extracted the insert DNA digestion product from agarose gel by gel-extraction kit and got 20 ul of Insert DNA solution.
Digestion of pSB1AK3 by hindIII
The gel-extracted DNA solution contains Ag43-dT DNA and pSB1AK3 DNA because these DNA have same size of base pair and exist as same band in agarose gel. Thus we digest pSB1AK3 with HindIII to separate it from Ag43-dT.

Centrifuged at 15000 rpm, 10 min at 4C.
Removed supernatant and dried out at room temperature, after that added 10 ul of DW.

Added 1 ul of DNA to 50 ul of thawed competent cells on ice.
Incubated on ice for 30 min.
Added 350 ul of LB.
Incubated the cells for 2 hours at 37C.
Plated 300 ul of the culture onto first LBC dish and spread.
Added 450 ul of LB to 50 ul of the culture and plated 300 ul of it onto second LBC dish and spread.

Plasmid extraction of Ag43-dT-pSB1AK3 and RBS-pSB1A2
We used plasmid extraction kit of Nippon genetics and got 50 ul Ag43-dT-pSB1AK3 plasmid DNA solution.
Digestion of eCFP-pSB1A2 and RBS-pSB1A2
To make a construct of eCFP-RBS-pSB1A2, we digested eCFP-pSB1A2 by EcoRI and SpeI, and RBS-pSB1A2 with EcoRI and XbaI. And we digested pT7-RBS-pSB1C3 by XbaI as a control for confirmation of the ability to digest.

Ethanol precipitation of digestion products (eCFP and RBS-pSB1A2) and estimation of concentration
Added 5 ul of NaoAc, 1.5 ul of glycogen and 125 ul of 100% ethanol.
Centrifuged at 14000 rpm, 30 min at 4C.
Removed supernatant and added 220 ul of 70% ethanol.
Centrifuged at 15000 rpm, 15 min at 4C.
Removed supernatant and dried out at room temperature, after that added 10 ul of DW.
ethanol precipitation result
We estimated the concentration of ethanol presipitation products.The concentration of Insert DNA solution is about 20 ng/ul and Vector DNA solution is about 37 ng/ul.
Incubation of pT7-RBS-Ag43-dT-pSB1C3 transformation product
We failed to cultivation of above construct two times so we tried to incubation in LBC liquid medium.
Prepared 1.8 ml LBC into culture tubes.
Re-suspended 200 ul transformation product solution (which was mixed with LB and incubated for 3 hrs).
Incubated at 37C.
