Parts written above were incubated in 1 ml of LBA(dT,RBS,pT7) and LBC(pLacI-RBS-Ag43) for 16 hrs 30 min.
Add glycerol and Freeze at -80C
Estimation of plasmid concentration
Erectrophoresis result
Electrophoresis to estimate the concentration of plasmid extraction products(dT,RBS,pT7 and pLacI-RBS-Ag43).
Used 1% agarose gel.
Added EtBr to TBE buffer and soaked the gel by applying current.
Ran 1.2 ul of DNA solutions (1 ul is plasmid extraction product and 0.2 ul is Loading Dye) for 35 min.
Took a photograph of 1% agarose gel.

July 8th
(pT7 + RBS)
Transformation
Transformation for pT7+RBS+pSB1K3
Added DNA soltions (Ligation products) 1 ul to DH5α compitent cell.
Stood on ice for 30 min.
Added 600 ul of LB to transformed DH5α solution.
Pre-incubated for 2 hrs at 37C.
Splead 300 ul of LB&DH5α solution to LBK.
Incubated for 19 hrs.
Plasmid extraction
Plasmid extraction for Liquid culture product of K346007(Ag43)
Used FastGene Plasmid Mini Kit(Nippon Genetics)
Elutioned in 50 ul
First we eluted in collection tube. then moved in micro-centrifuge tube.
Electrophoresis
plasmid extraction result (With ligation result of pT7+RBS+pSB1K3)
Electrophoresis for plasmid extraction product(Ag43).
Prepared 1% Agalose gel and added EtBr then pre-migration for 30 min.
1 ul 1kb ladder, 1.2 ul plasmid extraction product(1 ul is DNA solution and 0.2 ul is loading dye) added then migtrated.
Glycerol stock
Made glycerol stock of K346007 (Ag43).
Parts written above were incubated in LBC.
Added glycerol and freezed at -80C

Assembling K346007(Ag43) + B0015(dT) with 2-piece assembly(Biobrisk standard assembly)
Digestion
Digested Ag43 and dT in solution by recipes Written below. Insert DNA required too much weight and volume(volume was calculated from concentration of plasmid extraction product)from our calculation. There are no insurance of succession of digestion.

Digestion result
K346007(Ag43) was 5190bp before digestion (Biobrick prefix + Ag43 + Biobrick suffix + pSB1C3).  After digestion, Ag43 and pSB1C3 was separated and became fragments about 3120bp(Ag43) and 2070bp(pSB1C3). Gel image above shows there are two fragments, one fragment is about 2000bp other fragment is 3000bp. Digestion would be succeeded. About Vector(Boo15:dT), the DNA was circular so DNA migrated more far than Linear DNA. d+ (Circular DNA) migrated little more far than d- (Linear DNA). so we think digestion was succeeded.
Ethanol precipitation
Ethanol precipitation for gel extraction products(K346007(Ag43) and B0015(dT))
Added 5 ul of NaoAc , 1.5 ul of glycogen and 125 ul of 100% ethanol to 50 ul DNA solutions.
