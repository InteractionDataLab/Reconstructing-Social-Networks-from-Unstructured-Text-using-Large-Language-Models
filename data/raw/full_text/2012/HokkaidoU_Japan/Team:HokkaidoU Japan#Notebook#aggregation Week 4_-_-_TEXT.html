Electrophoresis
Electrophoresis for Ag43(plasmid extraction at July 23rd) and Ag43 digestion results(digested with EcoRI and SpeI)
Plasmid extraction result
Digestion result
From this digestion result, we found out that one or two enzymes didn't work successfully but there are enough concentration of DNA in 3000bp band to use for digestion.
Gel extraction
Gel extraction for digestion production. We used FastGene Gel&PCR extraction kit(NipponGenetics)and got 50 ul of DNA solution.
Ethanol precipitation
Ethanol precipitation for digestion and gel extraction product.
Added 5 ul of NaoAc, 1.5 ul of glycogen and 125 ul of 100% ethanol.
Centrifuged at 15000 rpm, 10min at 4C.
Removed supernatant and added 220 ul of 70% ethanol.
Centrifuged at 15000 rpm, 10 min at 4C.
Removed supernatant and dried out at room temperature after that added 10 ul of DW.
Ethanol precipitation result
From this result, we estimated that the concentration of ethanol precipitation product is about 40 ng/ul.
Digestion

Transformation
Transformation plasmid DNA ligated at 25th (pT7-RBS-Ag43-dT on pSB1K3) into BL21.
Added 2 ul of plasmid DNA to 50 ul of thawed competent cells on ice.
Incubated on ice for 30 min.
Added 200 ul of LB then incubated the cells for 2 hrs at 37C.
Prepared and Labeled two petri dishes with LBK.
Spread 200 ul of the transformation onto first dish.
Added 450 ul of LB to 50 ul of the transformation and spread 200 ul of it onto second dish.
Incubated the plates at 37C for over 30 hrs.
There were no colony on the plates.
Electrophoresis
Electrophoresis of digestion and ligation products.
Placed TBE agarose gel in Electrophoresis chamber.
Added 1/2X TBE buffer to Electrophoresis chamber.
Added 5 ul of EtBr and ran at 100 V for 30 min.
Apply 1kb DNA ladder and each samples.
Ran at 100 V for 30 min.
Digestion and Ligation results
There are no band in the lane of ligation products. But if digestion products were not ligated, two bands of digestion products would exist in the lane.
