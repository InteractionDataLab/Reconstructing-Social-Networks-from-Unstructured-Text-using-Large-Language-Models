Digestion of eCFP-RBS-pSB1A2 and pBAD-RBS-pSB1A2
To make a construct of pBAD-RBS-eCFP-RBS-Ag43-dT-pSTV28 by 3piece ligation, we digested pBAD-RBS-eCFP-RBS-pSB1A2 by EcoRI and SpeI, Ag43-dT-pSB1AK3 (previously digested by HindIII) by XbaI and NotI, and pSTV28 by EcoRI and NotI. Then we digested pT7-RBS-pSB1C3 by XbaI and SpeI as a control for confirmation of the ability of restriction enzyme.

We used N1 (DW only) and N2(pBAD-RBS-Ag43-dT-pSB1A2)as controls. Desired product is about 542bp.
Colony PCR result
Because of mis-setting the PCR program, we failed to amplify desired DNA fragment so we retried the colony PCR in same reagent, correct PCR machine program.
Colony PCR result
We noticed that the ligated DNA contains at least Ag43-dT-BioBrick_Suffix complex. We selected No. 2,4 for incubation for plasmid extraction and No. 5,6 for Aggregation check.

We confirmed 4 bonds in the result of Inset DNA digestion. A Bond which shows the highest concentration and places about 8k ~ 10k bp area would be pBAD-RBS-eCFP-RBS-Ag43-pSTV28 construct. We considered about it bond whether remained from digestion, or at first formed dimer and separated by digestion. In either case, our target product has about 5200 bp and there is appropriate bond. We extracted the target bond from TBE gel and  went next step.

Prepared 2 ml LBA into culture tubes.
Re-suspended 2 colony mixture (No. 1 and No. 2 respectively).
Incubated at 37C for 20 hrs.
