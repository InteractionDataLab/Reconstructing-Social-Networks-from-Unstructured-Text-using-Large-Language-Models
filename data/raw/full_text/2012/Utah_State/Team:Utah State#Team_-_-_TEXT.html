Andrea Halling
Andrea is entering her sophomore year at Utah State in Biological Engineering.  She is involved in undergraduate research in Dr. Miller’s synthetic biology lab and is a first year member of iGEM. In addition to research, Andrea loves being involved with Engineers without Borders Mexico as well as the USU women’s lacrosse team.
Jamal Abdinor
Jamal is a Junior in Chemical Engineering at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. He spent the summer helping out with the iGEM team.
Thomas Harris
Thomas Harris is an undergraduate in Biological Engineering at Utah State University.
Ryan Putman
Ryan is a Biological Engineering student entering his sophomore year at Utah State. He is involved in the Biological Engineering Club and has been participating in research in Dr. Jixun Zhan’s Metabolic Engineering Lab. His interests outside of the lab include basketball, weightlifting, and he used to be largely into chess. As it is his first year with iGEM, Ryan is looking forward to learning all of the basics and contributing in any way necessary to help the team succeed.
Brian Smith
Brian is a Junior in Biological Engineering, and this is his first year participating on the iGEM team.   His personal research is centered in optimizing and reducing the cost of algal produced biodiesel.  He enjoys spending time biking, running, and rock climbing and he also enjoys spending time with his family.
Elizabeth Martinez
Elizabeth Martinez recently obtained her bachelor’s degree in Biological Engineering from Utah State University. She is now pursuing a Master’s degree in Biological Engineering doing research with wastewater and algae to design a clarifier for the city of Logan Utah. Elizabeth was very eager to be for the first time part of the iGEM team this year. She became interested in synthetic biology after working months in her senior design project which consisted in transforming a yeast (Pichia pastoris), a eukaryotic organism, to produce and excrete green fluorescent protein (GFP). Elizabeth is originally from Mexico and apart from the lab and school she likes helping people and spending time with her loved ones.
Charles Barentine
Charles Barentine is an undergraduate in Biological Engineering at Utah State University. This is his second year as part of the iGEM team, and he hopes to make this one an even more enduring experience than the previous years. Charles loves being outdoors in Logan and spends his time outside of the lab rock climbing, hiking, snowboarding and anything else that involves moving about.
Federico Rodriguez
Federico Carlos Rodriguez is starting his junior year at USU. He is a transferred student from the Dominican Republic majoring in Biological Engineering and minoring in Math. He likes playing sports, especially soccer, dancing, Latin music, and watching movies.
Kathleen Miller
Kathleen Miller is a junior at Logan High School in Logan Utah.  She has been interested in biology and engineering for several years.  This is her first year on the Utah State iGEM team.  She is helping the team by performing general laboratory duties which include various molecular biological engineering techniques.  She is an avid ski racer, All-State golfer, and is on the varsity basketball team.
Swetha Chandrasekar
Swetha is a Junior in Chemical Engineering at Cooper Union University in Manhattan, New York. She spent the summer in Logan helping out USU's iGEM team with various tasks.
Graduate Advisers
Asif Rahman
Asif is one of the graduate advisers. Currently, he is pursuing his PhD in Biological Engineering at Utah State University. His area of study is secretion based recovery of bioplastic from recombinant E.coli and scale-up of the process. Asif is from Auckland, New Zealand. He obtained his Bachelors in Chemical and Biological Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his Masters in Chemical and Material Engineering from the University of Auckland. Outside of the lab Asif plays cricket, swimming, and soccer. He also enjoys traveling.
Cody Tramp
Cody is a third-year Ph.D. student in Biological Engineering. He received a B.S. in Biology and B.S. in Biochemistry from Utah State University. His current research project focuses on expanding synthetic biological engineering techniques into cyanobacteria and developing a standardized system for manipulating the genome of these organisms. His career goals involve expanding the capacity of synthetic biological engineering to a full-genome scale. He considers himself a true lab rat, and enjoys spending the bulk of his time in the research lab. When not at the bench, he can be found in the library buried in a book or writing computer programs.
Joshua Ellis
Josh Ellis is a graduate advisor and a PhD student in Biological Engineering at USU. His dissertation research is focused on producing biogas and biofuels using methanogenic and solventogenic microbial populations respectively. Josh is from Idaho Falls, ID. He received his BS in Microbiology in 2008 and MS in Microbiology in 2010. He enjoys recreational activities, movies, books, and spending time with his family.
Cameron Copeland
Cameron Copeland is in the second year of his PhD in Biological Engineering.  He received his B.S. in Biological Engineering from Utah State. Cameron's interests includes racquetball, reading, board games and billards.  For the last two years he has taught billiards classes at Utah State and has participated in several tournaments all over the west.

About Utah State University
Cache Valley of northern Utah is the home of Utah State University.  Utah State has become nationally recognized in athletics and academics as it has grown from the small land grant Agricultural College it began as in 1888.  Its undergraduate research program is the second oldest in the nation with more than a fourth of the undergraduate students involved in their own research.   Utah State is on the cutting edge of research in engineering, and continues to excel in many disciplines.
