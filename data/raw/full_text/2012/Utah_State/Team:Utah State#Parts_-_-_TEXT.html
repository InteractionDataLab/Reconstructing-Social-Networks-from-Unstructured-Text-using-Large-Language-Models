Full List of Spider Silk BioBrick Parts
The figure below shows all 64 of the BioBrick spider silk units generated by the Utah State iGEM team. We are the first team to generate a repository of BioBrick spider silk genes.
Legend
Each block represents one BioBrick part construct
U,W,F,B - different spider silk subunits
U# - where # is the number of repeated units. e.g. U8 means there are 8 repeats
HT- Histag
P- the promoter and rbs, Part:BBa_K208010
GFP- Part:BBa_K208000
Note that * indicates that the part has been submitted to registry, all parts are available on request from the Utah_State Team.
