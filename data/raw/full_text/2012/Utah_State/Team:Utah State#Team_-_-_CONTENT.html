University. She is now pursuing a Master’s degree in Biological Engineering doing research with
wastewater and algae to design a clarifier for the city of Logan Utah. Elizabeth was very eager to be
for the first time part of the iGEM team this year. She became interested in synthetic biology after
working months in her senior design project which consisted in transforming a yeast (Pichia pastoris),
a eukaryotic organism, to produce and excrete green fluorescent protein (GFP). Elizabeth is originally
from Mexico and apart from the lab and school she likes helping people and spending time with her
loved ones.
