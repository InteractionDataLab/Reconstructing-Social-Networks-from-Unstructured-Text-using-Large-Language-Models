Modelling Performance
We have used MathWork's SimBiology software to model the performance of each of our individual models.  These models give an idealised 'in silico' picture of circuit performance which may be compared to our 'in vitro'/'in vivo' characterization results.
Please see the individual module pages for more information on these models.
