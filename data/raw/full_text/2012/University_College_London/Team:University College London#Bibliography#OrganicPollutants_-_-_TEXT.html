"Persistent organic pollutants carried by synthetic polymers in the ocean environment"
(Rios, L. M., Moore, C., & Jones, P. R., et al. Marine pollution bulletin. 2007; 54(8):1230-1237)
This paper indicates that persistant organic pollutants adsorb to the surfaces of plastic debris in the marine environment. Samples taken for this paper were from the North Pacific Gyre, consistent with the region we aim to target.
