Chalmers iGEM and Dr. Eriko Takano
Biodetection of hCG hormone
The Chalmers Gothenburg team are working to modify Saccharomyces cerevisiae to function as a biosensor for the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG). This hormone is produced in the body during pregnancy and and their idea is for their biosensor is to function as a simple pregnancy test. They also plan to introduce genes for bio-indigo production as the output signal of the pregnancy test.
Moving Biotech into a Problem-Based Field
Prof. Dr. Eriko Takano (Groningen) has an internationally leading position in the field of small signalling molecules in Streptomyces coelicolor, the model organism of the major group of commercial antibiotic producers. Her research interests include the synthetic biology of new antibiotics, the systems biology of the metabolic switch from primary to secondary metabolism, and the regulation of antibiotic production through signalling molecules.
