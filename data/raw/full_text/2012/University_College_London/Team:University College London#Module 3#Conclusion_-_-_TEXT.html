Module 3: Degradation
Description | Design | Construction | Characterisation | Modelling | Results | Conclusions
Conclusion
Through the use of a simple quantitative assay, it has been ascertained that E. coli transformed with this UCL construct has a significantly increased extracellular laccase activity when compared with a control cell line. Combined with the results from the scanning electron microscope, which indicate surface degradation of polyethylene in a relatively short timespan, we can summise that this BioBrick holds powerful potential for the break down of polyethylene.
Taking into consideration our modelling findings, we conclude that our Degradation module has the capacity to allow the degradation of polyethylene in the marine environment, able to produce laccase in sufficient quantity, a key consideration in clearing up plastic pollution in the oceans.
Future work on this module would include investigating other laccase producing organisms, especially Rhodococcus ruber C208, whose laccase has a know polyethylene degrading effect.
