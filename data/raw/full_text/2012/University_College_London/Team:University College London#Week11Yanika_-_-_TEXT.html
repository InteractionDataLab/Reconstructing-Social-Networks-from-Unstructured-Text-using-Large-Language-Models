The first digest was carried out in order to prepare the Upstream Part for ligation through an EcoRI-HF™ and SpeI preparative digest:
Ingredient
Amount
Upstream Part Plasmid
500 ng
EcoRI-HF
1 µl
Spel
1 µl
10X NEBuffer 2
5 µl
100X BSA
0.5 µl
H2O
to 50 µl
Another digest was carried out in order to prepare the downstream DNA for ligation through an XbaI/PstI preparative digest:
Ingredient
Amount
Downstream Part Plasmid
500 ng
Xbal
1 µl
Pstl
1 µl
10X NEBuffer 2
5 µl
100X BSA
0.5 µl
H2O
to 50 µl
Another digest was carried out to prepare the backbone plasmid through an EcoRI-HF/PstI preparative digest:
Ingredient
Amount
Destination Plasmid
500 ng
EcoRI-HF
1 µl
PstI
1 µl
10X NEBuffer
2.5 µl
100X BSA
0.5 µl
H2O
to 50 µl
For each of the digests above, incubate all three restriction digest reactions at 37°C for 10 minutes and then heat inactivate at 80°C for 20 minutes.
Ligate the Upstream and Downstream Parts into the digested Destination Plasmid, using the following:
Ingredient
Amount
Upstream Part digestion
2 µl
Destination Plasmid digestion
2 µl
10X T4 DNA Ligase Buffer
2 µl
T4 DNA Ligase
2 µl
H2O
11 µl
After this is prepared, incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes and then heat inactivate at 80°C for 20 minutes.
