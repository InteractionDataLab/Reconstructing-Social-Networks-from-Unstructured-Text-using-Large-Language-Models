"Curli expression of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli"
(Szabó E, Skedsmo A, Sonnevend A, et al. Microbiologica. 2005;50(1):40-46)
While the paper does not directly analyse the binding of curlis to plastics, the data generated by the paper indicates the necessity of curlis for plastic adherence. The paper correlates the expression of curlis via congo red dye, with the binding of cells to plastic.
