In order to compare growth rates of W3110 and indolifex in LB and MB media, the following steps were carried out:
1. Inoculate 10ul of W3110 glycerol stock in 10ml of LB and another 10ul of W3110 glycerol stock in 10ml of MB
2. Repeat this with an indolifex glycerol stock
3. Measure the absorbence of all four samples every hour for 12 hours. Then take a final measurement after another 12 hours. Thus, measurements span 24 hours.
