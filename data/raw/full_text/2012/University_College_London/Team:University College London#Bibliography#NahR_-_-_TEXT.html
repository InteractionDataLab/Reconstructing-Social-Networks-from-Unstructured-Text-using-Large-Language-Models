"Demonstration, characterization, and mutational analysis of NahR protein binding to nah and sal promoters"
(Schell, M. a, & Poser, E. F., et al. Journal of Bacteriology. 1989; 171(2):837-846)
This paper indicates that the NahR protein is found bound to the promoter region sal. In the absence of salicylate or a salicylate-analogue, expression is at basal level. However, in the presence of salicylate or a salicylate-analogue, a conformational change is induced in NahR, activating downstream expression.
