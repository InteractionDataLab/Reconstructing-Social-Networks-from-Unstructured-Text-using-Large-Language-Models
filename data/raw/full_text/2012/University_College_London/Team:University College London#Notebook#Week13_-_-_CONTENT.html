the laccase BioBrick and they will also be conducting preliminary curli characterisation. James and the rest of the presentation team will be improving the presentation to present to our supervisors, Darren and Eli on Friday. Erin, Aurelija and Joanne are attempting to predict the required density/mass of bacteria in terms of containment and degradation modules - this will require further experimental data for our containment module and elaboration of the Simbiology degradation model. Erin and Bethan have arranged to speak to Alan Evans, from UNCLOS about ocean regulations. Aurelija has planned to skype LMU Munich with regards metabolic flux modelling, and later she will also talking to Bielefeld about our laccase modelling collaboration. The modelling team are also drafting the metabolic flux modelling for irrE. In the lab, Aurelija is characterisation of the nuclease biobrick. Bouran, Martina and Aurelija will also prepare more competent cells, as we are doing tons of transformations, and the ligations are on fire!
