Module 4: Buoyancy

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that our module (BBa_K729008) shows an increase of GFP expression compare with BBa_K200018 due to the presence of T7 RNA polymerase and T7 promoter in the module. Moreover, computer models and experimental data have shown the same tendency where our module has higher GFP accumulation compare with GFP controlled by cstA promoter.
The improvement made suggests that any gene placed downstream T7 promoter are very likely to show high-yield protein expression, therefore in the future we would aim to use this device for other modules such as degradation (for the laccase synthesis), salt tolerance (for the IrrE expression) and aggregation (for curli expression).
Also, we would like to test the buoyancy of our cells by determining their relative density. Cells will float or sink based on their density relative to the density of the solution surrounding them. Hence, by using different concentration of salt solutions, and observing the buoyancy of cells, a quantitative gauge of cell buoyancy can be determined.
