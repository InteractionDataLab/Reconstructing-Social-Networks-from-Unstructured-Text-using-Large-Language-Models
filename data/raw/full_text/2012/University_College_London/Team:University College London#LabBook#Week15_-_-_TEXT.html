Step 3 - Addition of BioBrick: Flick contents gently and centrifuge.
Step 4 - Centrifuge:
RPM: 14000
Time: 1 minute
Temperature: 18oC
Step 5 - Digest Program: Place the samples on a thermocycler under the following conditions:
RPM: 550
Time: 2.5 hours
Temperature: 37oC
Step 6 - Denaturing Enzymes: If you are not running the samples on a gel immediately, denature the restriction enzymes by running the samples on a thermocycler under the following conditions:
RPM: 550
Time: 25 minutes
Temperature: 65oC
Step 2- We run a gel of the digests
Methods:
Electrophoresis Protocol
Preparing the Gel
Step 1: Within a conical flask, add 3ml 50X TAE, 1.5g Agarose, and 150ml RO water
Step 2: Heat for 1 min in microwave. Swirl. Heat again for 30s. If solution is clear stop. Else repeat.
Step 3: Cool solution under running cold water.
Step 4: Add 20ul ethidium bromide (normal concentration of EB solution is 500ug/ul)
Step 5: Pour into a sealed casting tray in a slow steady stream, ensuring there are no bubbles
Running a gel
Step 6: Add 1 part loading buffer to five parts of loading sample
Step 7: Position the gel in the tank and add TAE buffer, enough to cover the gel by several mm
Step 8: Add 5ul of DNA ladder to lane 1
Step 9: Add samples to the remaining wells
Step 10: Run at 100 volts for 1hour and 15 minutes
Imaging the Gel
Step 11: Place gel in GelDoc 2000 chamber
Step 12: Turn GelDoc 2000 chamber on 
Step 13: From computer: Quantity One > Scanner > Gel_Doc_Xr>Manuqal Acquire
Step 14: Alter the exposure/settings to give a clear image.
TAE - Tris-acetate-EDTA
EDTA - ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
Results:
Conclusion: The bands that we obtained on the gel did not correspond to the sizes we were expecting. For most of the samples we could clearly see a band at around 2000 which most probably is the backbone. These confusing results may be due to mistakes during the ligation or the enzyme digestion. Contamination is another possible reason for these results.

Picking Colonies
Step 1 – Creating culture media: In a sterile environment, set up X numbers of falcons, each with 5mls of media.
Step 2 - Inoculating Colonies into a Selective Broth:: Add Yul of antibiotic to reach desired antibiotic concentration.
(For Ampicillin this is 50ug/ml, For Kanamycin it is 25ug/ml, for Tetracycline it is 15ug/ml, and for Chloramphenicol  it is 25ug/ml)
Step 4 – Selecting a Colony: Select a clear, isolated colony and using an inoculation hoop scoop up a colony onto the tip. Deposit in the falcon tube
Step 5 - Culture: Culture your falcon tubes overnight at a temperature of 37 oC. Leave for no longer than 16 hours.

Aim – We would like to ligate BBa_I746909 to BBa_K729007 to obtain the following construct pCstA+RBS+T7RNAP+pT7+RBS+GFP+TT
Step 1 We minipreped  the successful ligation of the  pcstA (BBa_K118011) +RBS-T7RNAP (BBa_I712069)  ligation which is our BioBrick BBa_K729007
Method
Miniprep Protocol 1 (Qiagen)
Step 1 - Pellet Cells: Pellet 1-5ml bacterial overnight culture by centrifugation at >8000rpm (68800 x g) for 3 min at room temperature (15-25oC)
Step 2 - Resuspend Cells: Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250ul Buffer P1 and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube
Step 3 - Puncturing Cell Membrane: Add 250ul Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times until the solution becomes clear. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 min.
Step 4 - Neutralising buffer P2: Add 350ul Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times.
Step 5 - Centrifuge:
RPM: 13000
Time:10 minutes
Temperature: 18oC
Step 6 - Centrifuge: Apply the supernatant from step 5 to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting. Centrifuge for 30-60s and discard the flow-through.
Step 7 - Remove Endonucleases from Sample: Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 500ul of Buffer PB. Centrifuge for 30-60s and discard flow-through.
Step 8 - Remove salts from sample: Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 750ul of Buffer PE. Centrifuge for 3-60s and discard flow through.
Step 9 - Centrifuge:
RPM: 13000
Time:1 minute
Temperature: 18oC
Step 10 - Elute DNA: Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. To elute DNA, add 50ul Buffer EB to the centre of the spin column, let it stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.
Step 2 Ligation was performed using the BioBricks BBa_I746909 and BBa_K729007 to generate a BioBrick that contains pcstA-T7RNAP-pT7-GFP-TT.
Step 3 Transformation – we plated 4 plates; plate 1 and 2 were with the transformed BBa_I746909  biobrick and  plate 3 and 4 were transformed with our ligation (BBa_I746909+BBa_K729007).  We are going to incubate over night at 37C and colonies picking the next day.
Method:
Transformation Protocol 1
Step 1 - Addition of BioBrick: To the still frozen competent cells, add 1 - 5 µL of the resuspended DNA to the 2ml tube.
Step 4 - Incubation: Close tube and incubate the cells on ice for 45 minutes.
Step 5 - Heat Shock: Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 37ºC for 10 minutes.
Step 6 - Incubation: Incubate the cells on ice for 2 minutes.
Step 7 - Add media: Add 1.5ml of Lysogeny Broth and transfer to a falcon tube.
Step 8 - Incubation: Incubate the cells at 37ºC for 1 hour at RPM 550. 
Step 9 - Transfer: transfer the solution back into a 1.5ml Eppendorf and centrifuge
RPM: 14000
Time: 2 minutes
Temperature (18-25oC)
Step 10 - Resuspend:Remove supernatant and resuspend in 100ul LB
Step 11 - Plating: Spread the resuspended cell solution onto a selective nutrient agar plate. Place the plates in a 37°C static incubator, leave overnight (alternatively a 30°C static incubator over the weekend)

DNAse assay
For BL21 cell line that has been modified to contain nuclease:
1. Prepare 11-16 plates (DNAse - Agar + CMP)
2. Streak cells onto all plates at the same time
3. Incubate at 37°C
4. Apply HCl to the first plate before putting in the incubator (set time as zero)
5. Take a second reading after four hours, followed by six readings every 3 hours, and a final three readings every two hours.
6. When the reading is taken, observe the following: a. Diameter of the colony (once the diameter of the colony is measured, pick the colony and put it to grow in LB for nine hours) b. Diameter of the halo that is achieved once HCL is applied c. OD from a) d. Estimate of the depth of the colony on the agar plate

Tuesday (18.09.12)
Aim – We would like to determine if BBa_K729006 is functioning as intended and producing laccase.
Method:
Laccase characterisation
In order to characterise laccase, the following steps are carried out:
1) W3110 cells transformed with laccase and control W3110 cells are inoculated in 10mL of LB media, and incubated overnight at 37˚C in a 200rpm shaker
2) The O/N culture is then centrifuged at 6100g for 20 minutes, in order to extract the media containing laccase. The supernatant is retained.
3) In order to take readings, cuvettes are prepared with 2.2mL KH2PO4 buffer + 0.5mL Laccase supernatant + 0.3mL Syringaldazine, which is added immediately before readings are begun (as explained in step 4). A blank is created using 0.5mL of LB media instead of laccase supernatant.
4) The optical density at 530nm of each of the samples is measured at five minute intervals over 30 minutes.
Conclusion - Our cells are producing an elevate amount of laccase compared to the control, indicating that the BioBrick is functioning as intended.
Friday (21.09.12)
Aim – We would like to determine if our laccase producing BBa_K729006 is capable of degrading polyethylene.
1) Cells are grown overnight in 10ml of LB media at 37˚C, 200rpm.
a) BBa_K729006
b) W3110 Control
2) 1cm2 low density polyethylene squares are introduced into the media, which is incubated for 3 days. Separate LDPE squares are placed in water in this timeframe.
3) LDPE squares are removed from media, dried, mounted, and coated with gold-palladium for scanning electron microscopy
4) LDPE samples are viewed under the SEM at 100x and 10 000x magnification, observing pitting caused by laccase catalysed degradation.
Conclusion - Our laccase producing cells are degrading polyethylene, allowing our BioBrick to be utilised for this function.

Aim – We would like to determine if BBa_K729005 is functioning as intended.
1) Cells are grown overnight in 15ml of LB media at 37˚C, 200rpm.
a) BBa_K729005
b) W3110 Control
2) Shake flasks are inoculated with 5 ml of cells, with the following media (50ml):
a) LB media
b) LB media + 0.3M NaCl
c) LB media + 0.6M NaCl
3) Shake flasks are run at 37˚C, 200rpm, measuring the optical density at 600 nm for each flask each hour.
4) Optical density is measured until the cells exit the exponential growth phase
Conclusion - Our transformed cells exhibit improved growth rates, and higher cell count in high salt conditions. This indicates that our cells are producing IrrE, and that our BioBrick is functioning as intended.
