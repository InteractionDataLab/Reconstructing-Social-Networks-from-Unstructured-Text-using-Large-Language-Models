Access To the Registry
Through our in-depth collaboration with the London BioHackers, our visits and interviews with MadLab and La Paillasse and our ongoing DIYbio community survey, we have discovered a real hunger for working with Synthetic Biology and to work with BioBricks.
Opportunity
We believe that there is a great potential for Biohackers to contribute characterization data to BioBricks. It is also worth noting that many DIYbio members are from a computing background and could help transform the Registry website from its present state to a more modern, user-friendly and powerful interface.
Safety
After emailing Meagan Lizaro, it is clear that although the Registry of Parts is keen to open up the format, concerns over safety remain impediments. We believe that some kind of "licensing" for DIYbio laboratories needs to be established. These laboratories would adhere to a set of principles and guidelines and in turn the Registry could responsibly give them access to BioBricks. For Europe this might be a blessing in disguise: The tough regulations have forced Biohackers to take legal and safety issues very seriously. Soon, the first DIYbio laboratories licensed for genetic modification will open in Europe (MadLab). This is an opportunity to draft a DIYbio license in collaboration with the Registry, which we want to lobby for in the future.
London Community Lab
We have been very inspired by the collaboration with the London Biohackers and are now considering plans to take it further in a more sustainable way.
We aim to take this forward as a spin-off project
