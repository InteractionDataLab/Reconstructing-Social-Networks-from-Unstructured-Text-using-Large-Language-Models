Aim: To test how the amount of nuclease produced by W3110 E. coli cells changes over time
Methods:
Nuclease characterisation
For WNu cell line which has native secreted nuclease activity:
1. Prepare 11-16 plates (10ml DNAse - Agar + 10ul AMP + 10ul 1M IPTG). IPTG induces the lac promoter which in turn activates the transcription of nuclease.
2. Streak cells onto all plates at the same time
3. Incubate at 37°C
4. Apply hydrochloric acid (HCl) to the first plate before putting in the incubator (set time as zero)
5. Take a second reading after four hours, followed by six readings every 3 hours, and a final three readings every two hours.
6. When the reading is taken, observe the following:
a) Diameter of the colony (once the diameter of the colony is measured, pick the colony and put it to grow in LB for nine hours)
b) Diameter of the halo that is achieved once HCl is applied
c) OD from a)
d) Estimate of the depth of the colony on the agar plate
For BL21 cell line that has been modified to contain nuclease:
1. Prepare 11-16 plates (DNAse - Agar + CMP)
2. Streak cells onto all plates at the same time
3. Incubate at 37°C
4. Apply HCl to the first plate before putting in the incubator (set time as zero)
5. Take a second reading after four hours, followed by six readings every 3 hours, and a final three readings  every two hours.
6. When the reading is taken, observe the following:
a. Diameter of the colony (once the diameter of the colony is measured, pick the colony and put it to grow in LB for nine hours)
b. Diameter of the halo that is achieved once HCL is applied
c. OD from a)
d. Estimate of the depth of the colony on the agar plate
Results: The following table shows readings of the colony and halo diameters, plus the OD, taken at different times over 28 hours.

Conclusion: From the data collected, it is clear that colony size correlates with the nuclease produced, which is represented by the diameter of the halo. Readings indicated that both are proportionally related to time. The second run of the experiment will be done in the coming weeks so as to obtain data replicates in order to validate data (See Week 13).

Final extension: 72°C   5–10 minutes
Hold: 4°C
Results: The following diagram shows the results of a gel run with samples from an analytical digest in order to confirm plasmid identity of Curli and Laccase after PCR clean-up, with each well having 3ul of PCR purified product. In addition the table on the bottom right shows the concentration of the purified products. The samples in bold below represent the PCR reactions which where considered successful, and hence taken forward for ligation.
The following table shows a gel run with sampled of the purified IrrE gene. As can be seen from the gel, the purified material remained in the well, indicating that PCR clean-up was not successful.
Conclusion: Since PCR was unsuccessful, this was repetead  (See Week 12)

For each of the digests above, incubate all three restriction digest reactions at 37°C for 10 minutes and then heat inactivate at 80°C for 20 minutes.
Ligate the Upstream and Downstream Parts into the digested Destination Plasmid, using the following:

After this is prepared, incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes and then heat inactivate at 80°C for 20 minutes.
Step 2 - Aim: To carry out a ligation of cobalt curli and the terminator sequence and another ligation of the nuclease and terminator sequence, in preparation of further ligations. This was done by ligating the terminator sequence to the curli cluster of genes through an EcoRI-PstI ligation, and another ligation of the terminator to nuclease through an EcoRI-PstI ligation.
Once success of ligation is confirmed, two subsequent ligations will be carried out to attach the ligated sequences to the promoter and RBS, and eventually the backbone.
Methods:
T4 DNA ligase protocol
1. Set up the following reaction in a microcentrifuge tube on ice. (T4 DNA Ligase should be added last. Note that the table shows a ligation using a molar ratio of 1:3 vector to insert.)
COMPONENT

10X T4 DNA Ligase Buffer

Insert DNA (1 kb
50 ng (0.076 pmol)

to 20 μl
T4 DNA Ligase
1 μl
2. The T4 DNA Ligase Buffer should be thawed and resuspended at room temperature.
3. Gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down and microfuge briefly.
4. For cohesive (sticky) ends, incubate at 16°C overnight or room temperature for 10 minutes.
5. For blunt ends or single base overhangs, incubate at 16°C overnight or room temperature for 2 hours (alternatively, high concentration T4 DNA Ligase can be used in a 10 minute ligation).
6. Chill on ice and transform 1-5 μl of the reaction into 50 μl competent cells.
Step 3 - Aim: To transform W3110 cells with the ligated sequences from above.
Methods: Please refer to previous runs
The following table shows the number of plates with 10ul and 90ul of transformation product:
Ligation
Number of plates with 10ul volume of transformation product

Nuclease + terminator

In addition, three controls were used; one  agar plate with no antibiotic to act as a positive control, one agar plate with ampicillin instead of nuclease to act as a negative control and a final agar plate with chloramphenicol instead of curli to act as a negative control.
Thursday 23.08
Step 1 - Aim: To check whether transformation carried out using ligated sequences was successful.
Results: A large number of clear, isolated colonies were observed on all transformation plates. The positive control showed extensive growth, while the negative controls remained clear, indicating a successful transformation..
Conclusion: Since growth was as expected, colonies were picked for inoculation, as will be explained in the next step
Step 2 - Aim: To inoculate colonies from the transformation plates in preparation for purification and use in further ligations.
Methods: The following table shows the number of colonies picked:
Transformed ligation products
Number of colonies
Curli + terminator
4
Nuclease + terminator

In addition, three controls were used. One consisted of LB, another of LB + Amp and a third of LB + CMP.
Friday 24.08
Step 1 - Aim: To purify ligated gene+terminator DNA using inoculated colonies from the ligation transformation plates
Results: No growth was noted in the falcon tubes inoculated with colonies.
Conclusion: The purification protocol was not followed, and instead, a repeat of the transformation was carried out as will be explained next.
Step 2 - Aim: To repeat the transformation using the ligation samples.
Methods: Please refer to previous runs
