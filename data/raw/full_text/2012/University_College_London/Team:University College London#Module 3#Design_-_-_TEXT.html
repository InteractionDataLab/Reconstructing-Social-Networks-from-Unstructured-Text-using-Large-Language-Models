Module 3: Degradation
Description | Design | Construction | Characterisation | Modelling | Results | Conclusions
Design
We identified one requirement for this system, and have designed the module to meet it.
Requirement: The bacteria should carry a system capable of degrading polythelene
Laccase, an oxidoreductive enzyme, is important in bioremediation. Laccase from Rhodococcus ruber C208 has been found to be involved in polyethylene biodegradation. The Laccase mechanism involves the generation of free radicals which encourages degradation of polyethylene. As Rhodococcus strains are presently unavailable to us, our system includes CueO, a laccase/multi-copper oxidase from E. coli.
