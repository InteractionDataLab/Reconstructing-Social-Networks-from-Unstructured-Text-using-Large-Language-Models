Module 2: Aggregation

Conclusion
By removing the cobalt inducible promoter of BBa_K540000, we have created a more versatile BioBrick for the Parts Registry. Our congo red agar assay proves that the cells are producing the desired curli fibrins. From the data that we have obtained, we have proven that curliated biofilms exhibit greater shear resistance, allowing them be utilised in a greater number of environments and projects.
With respect to our own project, this new curli BioBrick will allow our Aggregation module to function in the marine environment, resisting the shear forces in the ocean, and allowing our cells to bind to plastics and cause aggregation.
In addition to this our model is able to predict the amount of curli fibrils synthesised over time. In the future this could be used to predict aggregation of different amounts of plastic.
