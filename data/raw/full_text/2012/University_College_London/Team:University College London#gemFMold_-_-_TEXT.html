GemFM - Episode 1 by Gemfm on Mixcloud
The hottest new radio show in town featuring international iGEM teams and synthetic biology experts.
News
Our first episode interviewing Chalmers Gothenburg and Eriko Takano is now available!
You can listen to the full episode on MixCloud , or just the interview parts on Soundcloud : Chalmers Part 1 (about the project) and Part 2 (about the competition) , and our expert interview with Dr. Eriko Takano.
Overview
Our aim is to raise awareness of the breadth of projects synthetic biology offers, and offer a platform for iGEM teams to share project news. The interviews will be archived by the iGEM HQ Alumni Association.

Biodetection of hCG hormone Aug 3rd
Chalmers Gothenburg, Sweden and Dr. Eriko Takano
The Chalmers Gothenburg team are working to modify Saccharomyces cerevisiae to function as a biosensor for the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG). This hormone is produced in the body during pregnancy and and their idea is for their biosensor is to function as a simple pregnancy test. They also plan to introduce genes for bio-indigo production as the output signal of the pregnancy test.
Prof. Dr. Eriko Takano (Groningen) has an internationally leading position in the field of small signalling molecules in Streptomyces coelicolor, the model organism of the major group of commercial antibiotic producers. Her research interests include the synthetic biology of new antibiotics, the systems biology of the metabolic switch from primary to secondary metabolism, and the regulation of antibiotic production through signalling molecules.
ChimeriQ Aug 13th
Queens, Canada and Dr Jay Keasling
The Queens team are making chimeric bacteria flagella. By making insertions in the variable domain of the bacterial flagellin, Queens aim to incorporate metal binding proteins, enzymes, adhesive proteins as well as scaffolding proteins to further extend the possible applications. Inspired by Dr. John Bohannon and the Dance Your PhD Contest, Queens are also developing dance as a unique alternative for explaining scientific concepts.
Dr Jay Keasling (Berkeley) is working on a replacement for jet fuel and diesel, following his success creating anti-malarial drugs from yeast. Biofuels are liquid fuels derived from the solar energy stored in plant biomass. His research team aim to engineer new microbes as an alternative to yeast that can quickly and efficiently ferment complex sugars derived from starch-based biomass into biofuels.
