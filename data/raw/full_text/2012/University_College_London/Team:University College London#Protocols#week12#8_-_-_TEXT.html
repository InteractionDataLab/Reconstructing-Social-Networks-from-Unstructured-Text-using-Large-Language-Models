Ligations for nuclease, curli and laccase
Digestions:
PSB1C3 with E + P PCR amplified Laccase with E + P  PCR amplified Curli with E+ P  Nuclease in Puc57 with E + P
Constitutive promoter + RBS construct with E + S  PCR amplified Laccase X + P PCR amplified Laccase X + P  Nuclease in puc57 with X + P
Digestion protocol:
250ng vector: xuL  Enzyme 1: 1uL  Enzyme 2: 1uL  NEB buffer 2: 2uL  BSA: 0.5 uL dH2O: made up to 20uL
Incubated at 37C for 30mins and heat inactivated at 80C for 20mins.
The following ligations were then  preformed:
Ligations were preformed using NEB quick ligase.
50ng of vector, 4uL,  Combined in a (3:1) molar ratio with insert 10uL 2X Quick ligation buffer  1uL quick ligase
Incubate at room temperature at 5mins  Transform immediately or store at -20
