class="mw-headline" id="Aims_For_This_Week">Aims For This Week</SPAN></H2><P>After last weeks training week we hope to finally begin construction. There are still a few hurdles: Our genetic circuits need our supervisor's approval and we might need to order some additional parts. 
One of the human practice events we're most excited about is collaborating with the DIYbio community. We want to finalize the concept and find a space for it, as well as apply for funding. Hopefully we also have a much nicer and more complete wiki by the end of this...
Also, we will be creating our &quot;project trailer&quot; this week, which we'll use for a very exciting Kickstarter campaign...

A Crowdfunder Campaign involves designing a short, quirky video to capture peoples attention about out project. This can be posted on www.sponsume.com to recruit for funding from wider audiences - most notably the wider UCL. <B>Outcome</B>: Decided on a stop-motion style of video and produced a rough storyboard  </DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Friday_22nd_June">Friday 22nd June </SPAN></H2><DIV class="notebook-training"><B>Wet Lab Training</B>- We continued training our other team members where we performed gel electrophoresis of our enzyme digest products.

Philipp suggested the idea of using google mapâs interface from which we could plant our plastic islands onto from which members of the public interested in donating could do so by purchasing âplasticâ land. So taking the colour scheme of google-maps I started drawing our islands. The shape of these islands took on the form of discard plastic bottles; keeping with our plastic theme! Thus, Plastic Republic is born: <A href="http://plasticrepublic.org/" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://plasticrepublic.org/</A></DIV><DIV class="notebook-sponsor"><B>Sponsorship - Creating the Crowdfunder Campaign</B> - Numerous team members met over the weekend to put together the stop-motion video for our Crowdfunder Campaign. The created over 500 photos of various scenes, with different team members moving, and therefore 'animating' different parts of the scene. These were collated to form a a short film.<B> Outcome:</B> Our Crowdfunder Campaign </DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Reflection"> Reflection </SPAN></H2><P>We are feeling optimistic after this week â many of the plans for construction and characterisation have been finalised, and we have a provisional schedule of completion dates for our modules. We are especially pleased with the progress made in human practice. After the training, we have a much better idea of how to engage certain audiences, and we have met with several parties about fundraising for our events. Now we are all really keen to complete training and preparation, and move forward with our plans.
</P><DIV class="notebook-success"><B>Success of the Week: Creating our Crowdfunder Video</B></DIV><DIV class="notebook-fail"><B>Fail of the Week: The colony which we inoculated for training that produced no cells was due to the use of the wrong antibiotic.
