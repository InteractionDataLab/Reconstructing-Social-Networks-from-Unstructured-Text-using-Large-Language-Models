Aim:
To repeat the DNAse/Nuclease Halo experiment in order to check whether results are repeatable. This included collecting data of halo diameters and colony diameters over 28 hour, and to determine how the nuclease production increases overtime.
Methods:
In order to be able to characterise cells, the following protocol was used:
Nuclease characterisation
For WNu cell line which has native secreted nuclease activity:
1. Prepare 11-16 plates (10ml DNAse - Agar + 10ul AMP + 10ul 1M IPTG). IPTG induces the lac promoter which in turn activates the transcription of nuclease.
2. Streak cells onto all plates at the same time
3. Incubate at 37°C
4. Apply hydrochloric acid (HCl) to the first plate before putting in the incubator (set time as zero)
5. Take a second reading after four hours, followed by six readings every 3 hours, and a final three readings every two hours.
6. When the reading is taken, observe the following:
a) Diameter of the colony (once the diameter of the colony is measured, pick the colony and put it to grow in LB for nine hours)
b) Diameter of the halo that is achieved once HCl is applied
c) OD from a)
d) Estimate of the depth of the colony on the agar plate
For BL21 cell line that has been modified to contain nuclease:
1. Prepare 11-16 plates (DNAse - Agar + CMP)
2. Streak cells onto all plates at the same time
3. Incubate at 37°C
4. Apply HCl to the first plate before putting in the incubator (set time as zero)
5. Take a second reading after four hours, followed by six readings every 3 hours, and a final three readings  every two hours.
6. When the reading is taken, observe the following:
a. Diameter of the colony (once the diameter of the colony is measured, pick the colony and put it to grow in LB for nine hours)
b. Diameter of the halo that is achieved once HCL is applied
c. OD from a)
d. Estimate of the depth of the colony on the agar plate
Results:
The following images show the results of the DNase assay with the left column showing the plates before HCL and the right column showing growth on plates after HCL:

Conclusion:
We have obtained data consistent with the previous DNase assay conducted, and thereby conclude that a linear correlation exists between colony size and halo diameter.
Tuesday 04/09
Aim:
To pick colonies from all the ligation transformation plates, prepared in Week 12. This included the ligations of curli, laccase and nuclease to the linker and the pb. This was done in order to purify the DNA and use it in subsequent ligations. This was done because gels from Week 12 showed unexpected bands. Hence, it was necessary to check whether this was due to unsuccessful purification and analytical digest, or due to unsuccessful ligation.
Methods:
Colony Picking
Step 1 – Creating culture media: In a sterile environment, set up X numbers of falcons, each with 5mls of media.
Step 2 - Inoculating Colonies into a Selective Broth:: Add Yul of antibiotic to reach desired antibiotic concentration.
(For Ampicillin this is 50ug/ml, For Kanamycin it is 25ug/ml, for Tetracycline it is 15ug/ml, and for Chloramphenicol  it is 25ug/ml)
Step 4 – Selecting a Colony: Select a clear, isolated colony and using an inoculation hoop scoop up a colony onto the tip. Deposit in the falcon tube
Step 5 - Culture: Culture your falcon tubes overnight at a temperature of 37 oC. Leave for no longer than 16 hours.
Wednesday 05/09
Step 1 - Aim:
To carry out a miniprep of the inoculations from the ligation transformation plates.  After this, an analytical digest is prepared and run on a gel in order to confirm DNA identity
Method:
In order to carry out a miniprep, the following protocol was used:
MiniPrep
Step 1 - Pellet Cells: Pellet 1.5-5ml bacterial culture containing the plasmid by centrifugation  g = 6000
Time = 2 min

Thursday 06/09
Aim:
To check whether transformations using ligation product on the previous day were successful.
Results & Conclusion:
No colonies were visible on the plates. Hence, the transformation was considered to be unsuccessful and needs to be repeated.
Wednesday 05/09
Aim:
To characterise the two strains of laccase obtained from the laccase ligation.
Method:
Laccase characterisation
In order to characterise laccase, the following steps are carried out:
1) W3110 cells transformed with laccase and control W3110 cells are inoculated in 10mL of LB media, and incubated overnight at 37˚C in a 200rpm shaker
2) The O/N culture is then centrifuged at 6100g for 20 minutes, in order to extract the media containing laccase. The supernatant is retained.
3) In order to take readings, cuvettes are prepared with 2.2mL KH2PO4 buffer + 0.5mL Laccase supernatant + 0.3mL Syringaldazine, which is added immediately before readings are begun (as explained in step 4). A blank is created using 0.5mL of LB media instead of laccase supernatant.
4) The optical density at 530nm of each of the samples is measured at five minute intervals over 30 minutes.
Result:
Not shown
Conclusion:
We have determined that laccase strain 2 is a better laccase producing strain. Furthermore, we have proven the function of our BioBrick, as the oxidation activity of both laccase stratins was significantly higher than that of the control W3110 strain.
Thursday 06/09
Aim:
To compare the difference in growth of Indoli and E. coli growth in LB & MB media
Methods:
Growth rate characterisation
In order to compare growth rates of W3110 and indolifex in LB and MB media, the following steps were carried out:
1. Inoculate 10ul of W3110 glycerol stock in 10ml of LB and another 10ul of W3110 glycerol stock in 10ml of MB
2. Repeat this with an indolifex glycerol stock
3. Measure the absorbence of all four samples every hour for 12 hours. Then take a final measurement after another 12 hours. Thus, measurements span 24 hours.
Results:
The following graphs show growth of the different strains and different media. The flasks were placed in a 370C shaker at 200rpm.
Conclusion:
From the above graphs, it can be seen that marine bacteria grows better in MB, irrespective of the temperature used.
