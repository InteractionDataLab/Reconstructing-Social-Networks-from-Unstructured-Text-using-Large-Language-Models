is an international competition, to promote research into new uses of synthetic biology. Teams from Universities and High Schools from all over the world meet to compare research, and receive awards for success in particular categories. 
</P><P>We are the 4th team from UCL to enter this competition, and we are hoping to build upon the success of previous teams. Like many iGEM teams, we come from diverse courses - computer science, biochemistry, medical sciences and biochemical engineering. We are also collaborating with student filmmakers and architects. The purpose of this wiki is to ‘show-off’ what this team has achieved. We realise iGEM wikis have a lot of content, so if you are new to iGEM you may find the following guide useful.   
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="What_is_Synthetic_Biology.3F">What is Synthetic Biology?</SPAN></H2><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Tour_of_the_UCL_2012_Wiki">Tour of the UCL 2012 Wiki</SPAN></H2><P>After the <A href="/Team:University_College_London" title="Team:University College London">HOMEPAGE</A>, the <A href="/Team:University_College_London/Team" title="Team:University College London/Team">TEAM</A> page is a good first-stop on the wiki. Visit here for an introduction to the team members and a better breakdown of their roles in the project.
</P><P>If you are ready to learn more about our scientific work, be sure to visit our <A href="/Team:University_College_London/Research" title="Team:University College London/Research">RESEARCH</A> page. Eventually, you will find all the details of our research here, but as this is a ‘work in progress’ we will briefly outline the concepts here. Our research goal is to construct an island from plastic waste. Essentially, by engineering bacteria to bind and aggregate plastic waste – which is found in huge abundance in many of the world’s oceans – we will be able to turn this waste into a valuable resource. Realistically, these plastic islands could be collected and re-cycled, but our team are also promoting the idea of a ‘Plastic Republic’ – a habitable island formed from the aggregated plastic waste.  
</P><P>As part of the <A href="/Team:University_College_London/Research" title="Team:University College London/Research">RESEARCH</A>, we generate both experimental and computational data. For the experimental data, the Biochemists, Engineers and Medical Scientists design the experiments, and all of the team members pitch in to produce the data. However, most iGEM teams also have a contingent of Computer Scientists (Erin, Joanne, Phillipp and Tom) who use software to model the unpredictable aspects of the project. We rely heavily on predictions made by this computational data, which guide the experimental science. 
</P><P>A whole section of our wiki will be devoted to <A href="/Team:University_College_London/HumanPractice" title="Team:University College London/HumanPractice">HUMAN PRACTICE</A>, which is another key aspect of iGEM. Beyond the lab work and computer modelling, iGEMers go out into the community and demonstrate their research.  This is a vital to promote understanding of our research – to individuals who are not necessarily involved in science - and to gain valuable insight into how they perceive our research. This is usually a very interesting page as many teams, UCL 2012 included, chose controversial research projects that raise important questions.  
</P><P>The  <A href="/Team:University_College_London/Notebook" title="Team:University College London/Notebook" class="mw-redirect">NOTEBOOK</A> page of our wiki documents, day-by-day, the above activities of our team members, or if you visit the  <A href="/Team:University_College_London/Achievements" title="Team:University College London/Achievements">ACHIEVEMENTS</A>  page of our wiki you will find a summary of our main <A href="/Team:University_College_London/Research" title="Team:University College London/Research">RESEARCH</A> and <A href="/Team:University_College_London/HumanPractice" title="Team:University College London/HumanPractice">HUMAN PRACTICE</A> successes.
