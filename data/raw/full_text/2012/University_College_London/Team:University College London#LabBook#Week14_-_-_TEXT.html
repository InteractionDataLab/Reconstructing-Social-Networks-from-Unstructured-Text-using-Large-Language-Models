Aim:
To characterise nuclease activity BL21 cells
Method:
Nuclease characterisation
For BL21 cell line which has inserted nuclease the following steps were followed:
1. Prepare 11-16 plates (10ml LBAgar+10ul CMP )
2. Streak cells onto all plates at the same time
3. Incubate at 37°C
4. Apply hydrochloric acid (HCL) to the first plate before putting them in the incubator (set time as zero)
5. Take a second reading after four hours, followed by six readings every 3 hours, and a final three readings every two hours. When the reading is taken, observe the following:
a) Diameter of the colony (once the diameter of the colony is measured, pick the colony and put it to grow in    LB for nine hours)
b) Diameter of the halo that is achieved once HCL is applied
c) OD from a)
d) Estimate of the depth of the colony on the agar plate
Results:
The following table shows readings of the diameters and OD at different time points:
Date
Time
Colony diameter/mm
Halo diameter/mm

The average depth of the colonies was noted to be  0.5 - 1mm
Conclusion:
It can be seen that nuclease works as expected in BL21 cells. However, nuclease activity is less efficient when compared to nuclease activity in WNu cells. This is in line with expectations, since nuclease is found naturally in WNu cells but not in BL21 cells.
