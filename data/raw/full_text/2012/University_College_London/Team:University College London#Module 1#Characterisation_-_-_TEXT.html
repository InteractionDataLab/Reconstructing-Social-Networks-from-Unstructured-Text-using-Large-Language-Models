Module 1: Detection

Characterisation
As the detection system is only useful in its relationship with the aggregation system, and both systems are linked, we will be characterising both systems in conjunction with one and other. Thus, we will be investigating the function of the detection system via the expression of curlis. This will be done using a Congo Red Agar assay, which causes cells expressing curlis to turn red.
