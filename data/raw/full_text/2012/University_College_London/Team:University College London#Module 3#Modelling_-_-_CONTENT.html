With this model we aimed to have an idea of how much plastic we could expect our system to degrade. This would then be used in further <A href="/Team:University_College_London/Modelling/DensityPredictions" title="Team:University College London/Modelling/DensityPredictions">predictive modelling</A> to calculate the amount of bacteria needed for the construction of Plastic Republic. The following diagram shows the degradation system, with each reaction R<SUB>i</SUB> and each DNA species explained below. 
</P><P>Our cell model was made in SimBiology, which is a MATLAB extension used to run simulations of the reactions in a specified system. It shows the following reactions taking place in three 'compartments', with each DNA species and reaction explained in further detail below:
</P><P>
1. <B>Outside1:</B> in this compartment we see the association, adherence, and dissociation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from polyethylene (PE) (R1).  We rely on the POPs to induce our degradation system, increasing from 10<SUP>5</SUP> to 10<SUP>6</SUP> the specificity to our system.
</P><P>
2. <B>Cell:</B> NahR is a constitutively produced mRNA product (R9). When POP diffuses into the cell (R2), it forms a complex with NahR (R3) which then binds to the pSal promoter (R4) to induce production of laccase (R5, R6).  Around 20% of this laccase diffuses outside of the cell (R7), the rest degrades (R10).
</P><P>
3.<B> Outside2:</B> in this compartment, the external laccase degrades PE (R9).  Some of this external laccase is degraded (R11).

In the first second of laccase production, we see polyethylene degradation beginning from around 0.6 sec:
</P><P>
After 10 seconds, the first few molecules have been degraded.  The constant diffusion of POPs into the cell is essential for the continuing degradation:
</P><P>At 100 seconds, the rate of degradation has risen to almost 1 PE molecule per second and we can assume that this will continue as long as the supply of POPs remains constant:
</P><P>
From these results, we can see that our bacteria will degrade polyethylene linearly after an initial non-linear increase in degradation. However, these graphs do not indicate which factors, such as initial concentrations, parameter values and environmental conditions are affecting degradation.  For this reason, we decided to run a sensitivity analysis on our model to test the robustness of the model.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Sensitivity_analysis"> Sensitivity analysis </SPAN></H2><P>We used SimBiology's sensitivity analysis tool to compute the sensitivity of the cell to variations in each model parameter and the initial amount of each DNA species. The aim was to find out how each of these impacts on the final concentrations of degraded PE and laccase. 
</P><P>
The results show that the amount of PE degraded is dependent on the kinetics of the laccase reaction (see the paramters labelled R8.k17 and R8.k19 in the upper bars in the diagram below, which correspond to the Vm and Km values  of laccase respectively). On the other hand, the amount of laccase degraded outside the cell is most dependent on the translation rate of laccase (see the parameter R6.k20 in the lower bars of the diagram). In addition, it also moderately affected by the rate of diffusion of laccase outside of the cell (see R7.p10) and therefore on the amount of laccase which ends up outside of the cell (Lexdegp).
</P><P>
The original aim in the development of the degradation model was to analyse the effect of POP, which acts as an environmental factor, on PE degradation. However, through the use of sensitivity analysis, it was deduced that there are more important parameter considerations (such as enzyme activity and translation rates) to take into account. It is reasonable to assume that POP levels are present in constant amounts, hence allowing for degradation of PE which varies with the translation rates and enzyme activity.  
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Impact_on_experimental_work"> Impact on experimental work </SPAN></H2><P>We initially believed that it was the amount of POPs present in the environment, rather than the specific activity of the enzyme used and the laccase translation rates, which would have the greatest effect on the amount of polyethylene degraded.  Thus, although we had initially identified <I>Rhodococcus ruber</I> C208 laccase strain<SUP>13</SUP> to use in the degradation of polyethylene, we now decided to use a laccase which was easier to obtain (<I>E. coli</I>).
</P><P>
Following the results of the sensitivity analysis, we realised that using a laccase with greater specific activity on PE would have a measurable impact on the amount of plastic our system can degrade. Hence, future modifications to our system will use <I>R. ruber</I> C208 laccase.
