"IrrE, a global regulator of extreme radiation resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans, enhances salt tolerance in Escherichia coli and Brassica napus.(Pan, J., Wang, J., Zhou, Z.(2009)PloS one, 4(2), e4422.)
This paper indicates that IrrE, a gene from Deinococcus Radiodurans, protects E. Coli from several abiotic stresses, including salt shock. We intend to utilise this protective property of the gene in our system, to allow the cells to endure ocean salinity.
