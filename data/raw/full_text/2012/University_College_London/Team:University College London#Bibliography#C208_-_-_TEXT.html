"The role of the copper-binding enzyme – laccase – in the biodegradation of polyethylene by the actinomycete Rhodococcus ruber"
(Santo, M., Weitsman, R., & Sivan, A, et al. International Biodeterioration & Biodegradation. 2012; 208:1-7)
This paper summarises the discovery that laccase produced by Rhodococcus Ruber C208 has been found to have polyethylene degrading properties. It suggests that laccase catalyses the oxidation of polyethylene, leading to its degradation.
