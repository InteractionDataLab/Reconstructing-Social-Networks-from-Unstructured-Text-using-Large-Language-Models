Miniprep Protocol 2 - ANACHEM
Step 1 - Pellet Cells: Pellet 1.5-5ml bacterial culture containing the plasmid by centrifugation  g = 6000
Time = 2 min
Temperature = (15-25oC)
Step 2 - Resuspend Cells: Add 250ul S1 to the pellet and resuspend the cells completely by vortexing or pipetting. Transfer the suspension to a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube.
Step 3 - Puncturing Cell Membrane: Add 250ul S2 gently mix by inverting the tube 4-6 times to obtain a clear lysate. Incubate on ice or at room temperature for NOT longer than 5 min.
Step 4 - Neutralising S2: Add 400ul Buffer NB and gently mix by inverting the tube 6-10 times, until a white precipitate forms.
Step 5 - Centrifuge:
g: 14000
Time:10 minutes
Temperature: (15-25oC)
Step 6 - Centrifuge: Transfer the supernatant into a column assembled in a clean collection tube (provided. Centrifuge:
g = 10,000
Time: 1 minute
Temperature: (15-25oC)
Step 7 - Wash Column: Discard the flow-through and wash the spin column by adding 700ul of Wash Buffer. Centrifuge:
g - 10,000
Time - 1 minute
Temperature: (15-25oC)
Step 8 - Remove residual ethanol: Centrifuge:
g - 10,000
Time - 1 minute
Temperature: (15-25oC)
Step 9 - Elute DNA: Place the column into a clean microcentrifuge tube. Add 50-100ul of Elution Buffer, TE buffer or sterile water directly onto column membrane and stand for 1 min. Centrifuge:
g - 10,000
Time - 1 minute
Temperature: (15-25oC)
Step 10 - Storage: Store DNA at 4oC or -20oC
