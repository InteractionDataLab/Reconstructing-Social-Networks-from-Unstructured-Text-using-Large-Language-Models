Our Models
The ocean model and density predictions shown here aim to predict how our system as a whole might function in the ocean.  The 'bigger picture' presented by these models will guide us in fine-tuning each individual module.  However, the bulk of our modelling looks at the performance of each module as a separate unit.  For these models, please see the 'Modelling' tab on the individual module pages, which starts here with our cell model for detection.
