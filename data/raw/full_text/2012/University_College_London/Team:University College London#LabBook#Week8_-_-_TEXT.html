Results:The image below shows a 3.5% Agarose Gel of an Analytical Restriction Enzyme Digest for Expt 7.3. The high agarose concentration of the gel was intended to slow the progression of DNA fragments to enable us to detect the small inserts of BBa_J23119 and BBa_B0034. The table below indicates the expected sizes of BioBricks and Plasmid Backbones. Accordingly, we used a the smallest available ladder, with fragments ranging from 25bp to 500bp. At the top of the gel it is possible to see the large fragments we detected on a 1000bp gel in Expt 7.3 Week 7. However, we had expected this gel to also demonstrate the BBa_J23119 insert (35bp) corresponding to letter A in Lane 1, and the BBa_B0034 insert, corresponding to letter B in Lane 3. No product was found. As expected, there was no product measurable against the 25bp ladder for the uncut plasmids in Lane 2 and Lane 4.

Conclusion:No product was detected for either BioBrick insert. However, we do no feel this necessarily proves the transformation failed, especially as we detected the correct plasmid backbone for each in week 7 (Expt 7.3). The modest nanodrop concentration obtained last week suggests that the concentration was not high enough to allow such a small fragment to be visualised. We are considering alternatives such as running a polyacrylamide gel, which is more sensitive to small fragments, or amplifying the fragment using PCR
Monday 30.7.12
Aim - Picking colonies: Colonies were picked for BBa_I750016, which demonstrated colony formation in Expt 7.4 on Friday 27.7.12.
Picking Colonies
Step 1 – Creating culture media: In a sterile environment, set up X numbers of falcons, each with 5mls of media.
Step 2 - Inoculating Colonies into a Selective Broth:: Add Yul of antibiotic to reach desired antibiotic concentration.
(For Ampicillin this is 50ug/ml, For Kanamycin it is 25ug/ml, for Tetracycline it is 15ug/ml, and for Chloramphenicol  it is 25ug/ml)
Step 4 – Selecting a Colony: Select a clear, isolated colony and using an inoculation hoop scoop up a colony onto the tip. Deposit in the falcon tube
Step 5 - Culture: Culture your falcon tubes overnight at a temperature of 37 oC. Leave for no longer than 16 hours.
Step 2 – Inoculating Colonies into a Selective Broth: The table below indicates the volume of broth and the concentration of antibiotic required for each BioBrick.

Monday 30.7.12
Aim - Transformation of previously failed BioBricks: BBa_C0040 was transformed in Expt 7.4, but appeared to be contaminated. BBa_R0040, as part of the same experiment, did not form colonies at all after transformation. Therefore both were reattempted.

Step 4 - Incubation: Close tube and incubate the cells on ice for 45 minutes.
Step 5 - Heat Shock: Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 37ºC for 10 minutes.
Step 6 - Incubation: Incubate the cells on ice for 2 minutes.
Step 7 - Add media: Add 1.5ml of Lysogeny Broth and transfer to a falcon tube.
Step 8 - Incubation: Incubate the cells at 37ºC for 1 hour at RPM 550. 
Step 9 - Transfer: transfer the solution back into a 1.5ml Eppendorf and centrifuge
RPM: 14000

Aim: In order to set up our salt tolerance characterisation we must grow up 10ml of W3110 and Salt Tolerance (BBa_K398108) transformed W3110 overnight
Wednesday 1.8.12
Aim: Today we commence the protocols for characterising salt tolerance.
Results: Our results demonstrate that out transformed cells are salt tolerant, compared to the untransformed W3110 cells.Our results reflect those of TU Delft 2010 who characterised the same BioBrick. However they did not show their results beyond the exponential phase, which we have included.
Conclusions: Growth rate during exponential phase is greater in the K398108 transformed E.coli W3110 than in the untransformed (same conclusion as drawn by TU Delft 2010).  Increase in growth rates significantly lower than original at highest salt concentration – could be explained by use of different E.coli strains i.e. higher growth rate of the non-transformed strain. We plan to repeat to strengthen conclusions.
Wednesday 1.8.12
Aim: Start 3A assembly to ligate the first (BBa_J23119+BBa_B0034), and second (plasmid backbone PSB1K3 and Pcst starvation promoter) constructs.
Method
Thursday 2.8.12
Aim: Evaluation of the plates from 3A ligation. This should inform us as to whether we can proceed and do the colony picking of both A (J23119+BB0034) and B (Pcst + BB0034) constructs.
Result: Observations showed that 3A was successful for the construct A, as shown in the image below. However there was no growth assembled pCST+BBa_B0034 (construct B). The following table summarises the results.
Conclusion: Colony picking was carried out for the first construct (BBa_J23119+BBa_B0034), but not from the second construct (plasmid backbone PSB1K3 and Pcst starvation promoter).
Method
Picking Colonies Protocol
Step 1 – Creating culture media: In a sterile environment, set up X numbers of falcons, each with 5mls of media.
Step 2 - Inoculating Colonies into a Selective Broth:: Add Yul of antibiotic to reach desired antibiotic concentration.
(For Ampicillin this is 50ug/ml, For Kanamycin it is 25ug/ml, for Tetracycline it is 15ug/ml, and for Chloramphenicol  it is 25ug/ml)
Step 4 – Selecting a Colony: Select a clear, isolated colony and using an inoculation hoop scoop up a colony onto the tip. Deposit in the falcon tube
Step 5 - Culture: Culture your falcon tubes overnight at a temperature of 37 oC. Leave for no longer than 16 hours.
Friday 3.8.12
Aim:Check the results of colony picking.
Results: There was growth. Next we can proceed to run a gel and a nanodrop to detect the presence of the correct bands, and whether we have a useable concentration.
Thursday 2.8.12
Aim - Transformation of alternative BioBricks: We have colony picked the BBa_J23119 constitutive promoter and the BBa_B0034 Ribosome Binding Site twice (Expt 6.3 & Expt 7,3), and gained a reasonable plasmid concentration. However the concentration was not high enough to be able to detect the product on the gel. This concerns us, because although we have detected the correct plasmid backbone, we are worried that we lack evidence that the transformation was successful. One option is to attempt several other BioBricks with the same function, in order to increase the chances of generating a product on the gel - and confirming that we definitely have a BioBricks with the required function.It would also increase the chance of generating successful ligations if we can reach a higher concentration of plasmid. We will also be reattempting the transformation of BBa_I750016 which failed several attempts at colony picking.

Conclusion: We had growth for all of our BioBricks, but also for the negative control which indicates there was contamination. Given we have had several issues with negative control recently, we decided we would not let the contamination delay the project. We will risk colony picking with the hope that we have some correctly transformed colonies. This will be commenced next week. It is worth noting that for Constitutive Promoter BBa_J23106 and for the Gas Vesicle Cluster BBa_I750016 there was a continuous film of growth. This suggests to us that the agar was not selective enough.
