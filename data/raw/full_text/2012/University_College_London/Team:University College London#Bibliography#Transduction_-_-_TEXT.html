"Gene transfer by transduction in the marine environment"
(Jiang, S. C., & Paul, J. H., et al. Applied and environmental microbiology. 1998; 64(8):2780-2787
This paper highlights the importance of transduction as a mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in the marine environment. It suggest that this is due the the high population of bacteriophages in the ocean that can mediate transduction.
