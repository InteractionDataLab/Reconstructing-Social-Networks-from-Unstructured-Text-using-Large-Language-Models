Characterisation
IrrE is deduced to globally regulate gene expression in E. coli, and to date, no specific assay allows for the convenient determination of IrrE expression. As such, the expression of IrrE will be determined indirectly by determining the increased salt tolerance of our cells. In order to confirm this, we will be conducting growth experiments in shake flasks. This will allow us to determine if our cells grow to a higher density in high salinity, and also whether their exponential growth rate is increased when compared to the untransformed cells.
As we will be using Lyon 2010 iGEM team's BBa_K540000 salt tolerance BioBrick for comparison, we will also attempt to replicate their results via growth rate experiments.
