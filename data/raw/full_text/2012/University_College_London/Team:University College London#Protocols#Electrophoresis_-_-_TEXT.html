Preparing the Gel
Step 1: Within a conical flask, add 3ml 50X TAE, 1.5g Agarose, and 150ml RO water
Step 2: Heat for 1 min in microwave. Swirl. Heat again for 30s. If solution is clear stop. Else repeat.
Step 3: Cool solution under running cold water.
Step 4: Add 20ul ethidium bromide (normal concentration of EB solution is 500ug/ul)
Step 5: Pour into a sealed casting tray in a slow steady stream, ensuring there are no bubbles
Running a gel
Step 6: Add 1 part loading buffer to five parts of loading sample
Step 7: Position the gel in the tank and add TAE buffer, enough to cover the gel by several mm
Step 8: Add 5ul of DNA ladder to lane 1
Step 9: Add samples to the remaining wells
Step 10: Run at 100 volts for 1hour and 15 minutes
Imaging the Gel
Step 11: Place gel in GelDoc 2000 chamber
Step 12: Turn GelDoc 2000 chamber on 
Step 13: From computer: Quantity One > Scanner > Gel_Doc_Xr>Manuqal Acquire
Step 14: Alter the exposure/settings to give a clear image.
TAE - Tris-acetate-EDTA
EDTA - ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
