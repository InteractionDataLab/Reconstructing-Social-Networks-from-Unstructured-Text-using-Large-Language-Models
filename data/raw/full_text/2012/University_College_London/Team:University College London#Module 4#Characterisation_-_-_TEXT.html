Characterisation
Starvation induction of E. coli transformed with this module will be done using minimal M9 media supplemented with different glucose concentrations (0%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 3.0% and 5.0%). Quantification of the reporter output (GFP) from the samples taken will be measured using Tecan Zafire2 microplate detection system to quantify fluorescence intensity (485 nm for excitation, 520 nm for emission).
