In lane 1 we expected a product equivalent to the combined size of the BBa_K540000 insert and pSB1C3 backbone (uncut plasmid). The position of this is shown by A, which corresponds to 5193 bp. In Lane 2 and Lane 3, there are no products, though we had expected to see a band corresponding to the size of the BBa_K540000 insert (3123bp) as shown by B and a band corresponding to the size of the pSB1C3 backbone (2070bp) as shown by C. In Lane 4, there should be a product corresponding to the combined size of the BBa_I13522 insert and pSB1A3 backbone (3092bp) which is indicated by D. This is absent. In lane 5, there are numerous products, but none corresponding to the size of the BBa_I13522 insert (937bp) as indicated by E, or the pSB1A3 backbone (2155bp) as indicated by F.

</P><P><B>Results:</B> The image below shows a 1% Agarose Gel of an Analytical Restriction Enzyme Digest for Expt 4.1. Lane 1 displays the products of a single cut reaction, which for the plasmid carrying BBa_K540000 should produce a product of 5193 bp â the sum of the plasmid backbone pSB1C3 and the BBa_K540000 insert. A very faint band corresponding to this size is indicated by A, but the presence of more prominant bands of incorrect size suggests this reaction failed. Lane 2 displays a product of the size corresponding to the BBa_K540000 insert (3123bp) as shown by B, and a product corresponding the pSB1C3 backbone (2070 bp) as shown by C. The larger product, labelled D, could be excess uncut plasmid, as it corresponds approximately to the correct size (5193bp). Lane 3 shows the products of a single cut reaction for BBa_I13522. A product corresponding to the combined size of BBa_I13522 insert and pSB1A3 plasmid backbone is present (3092bp) as indicated by E, but presence of other bands is concerning. Lane 4 shows an absence of the correct size insert (937 bp) as indicated by G, and an absence of plasmid backbone pSB1A3 (2155bp), as indicated by F. 
</P><P><B>Conclusion:</B> This gel would indicate that the BBa_K540000 transformation was a success, but there is some concern about the presence of extra bands in Lanes 1 and 2. For this reason we will repeat this gel when possible (See Expt 7.2). The BBa_I13522 transformation appears to be unsuccessful â there is not band corresponding to the insert. The digest will be repeated to be certain (See Expt 7.2).

</P><P><B>Step 3 - Addition of BioBrick:</B> Add 1 - 2 ÂµL of the resuspended DNA to the 2ml tube. Pipette up and down a few times, gently. Make sure to keep the competent cells on ice.
</P><P><B>Step 4 - Incubation:</B> Close tube and incubate the cells on ice for 30 minutes.
</P><P><B>Step 5 - Heat Shock:</B> Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 42ÂºC for 60 seconds.
</P><P><B>Step 6 - Incubation:</B> Incubate the cells on ice for 5 minutes.
</P><P><B>Step 7 - Add media:</B> Add 200 Î¼l of SOC media or LB broth
</P><P><B>Step 8 - Incubation:</B> Incubate the cells at 37ÂºC for 2 hours while the tubes are rotating or shaking.Â 
</P><P><B>Step 9 - Label plates:</B> Label two petri dishes with LB agar and the appropriate antibiotic(s) with the part number, plasmid backbone, and antibiotic resistance. Plate 20 Âµl and 200 Âµl of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread. This helps ensure that you will be able to pick out a single colony.
</P><P><B>Step 10 - Culture:</B>Incubate the plate at 37ÂºC for 12-14 hours, making sure the agar side of the plate is up. If incubated for too long the antibiotics start to break down and un-transformed cells will begin to grow. This is especially true for ampicillin - because the resistance enzyme is excreted by the bacteria, and inactivates the antibiotic outside of the bacteria.
</P><P><B>Step 11 - Colony Picking:</B> You can pick a single colony, make a glycerol stock, grow up a cell culture andÂ miniprep.
</P></DIV><P><B>Step 1 â Thawing Cells:</B> Use W3110 cell line created in Week 2 (Expt 2.1)

In Lane 3 and 4 we would expect a product for the BBa_K398108 insert (844bp) as indicated by B, and a product for the pSB1C3 plasmid backbone (2070bp) as indicated by C.  Both products are absent, further supporting the failure of the transformation.

We are currently in the process of attempting a âreinvigorationâ of this cell line, but decided we should also do a formal test of the competency of the original W3110 cell line. To do so we will attempt to transform our W3110 cells with a plasmid (pTop) available from the lab, with a known concentration of 297ng/ul. At such a high concentration, transformation should be relatively easy. 
</P><P>If the transformation is successful, it could be the concentration of certain BioBricks (which is unknown) that is affecting the ability of the W3110s to undergo transformation. However, if transformation with pTop is not successful, it would suggest our cells are not competent.

</P><P><B>Step 3 - Addition of BioBrick:</B> Add 1 - 2 ÂµL of the resuspended DNA to the 2ml tube. Pipette up and down a few times, gently. Make sure to keep the competent cells on ice.
</P><P><B>Step 4 - Incubation:</B> Close tube and incubate the cells on ice for 30 minutes.
</P><P><B>Step 5 - Heat Shock:</B> Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 42ÂºC for 60 seconds.
</P><P><B>Step 6 - Incubation:</B> Incubate the cells on ice for 5 minutes.
</P><P><B>Step 7 - Add media:</B> Add 200 Î¼l of SOC media or LB broth
</P><P><B>Step 8 - Incubation:</B> Incubate the cells at 37ÂºC for 2 hours while the tubes are rotating or shaking.Â 
</P><P><B>Step 9 - Label plates:</B> Label two petri dishes with LB agar and the appropriate antibiotic(s) with the part number, plasmid backbone, and antibiotic resistance. Plate 20 Âµl and 200 Âµl of the transformation onto the dishes, and spread. This helps ensure that you will be able to pick out a single colony.
</P><P><B>Step 10 - Culture:</B>Incubate the plate at 37ÂºC for 12-14 hours, making sure the agar side of the plate is up. If incubated for too long the antibiotics start to break down and un-transformed cells will begin to grow. This is especially true for ampicillin - because the resistance enzyme is excreted by the bacteria, and inactivates the antibiotic outside of the bacteria.
