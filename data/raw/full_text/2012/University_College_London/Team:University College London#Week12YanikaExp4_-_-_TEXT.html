In order to prepare the Deinococcus radiodurans template for PCR, a colony was picked off a plate (supplied by Prof. John Ward), resuspended in 10uL dH2O and added to boiling water in a screw top vial. This was left to return to ambient room temperature.
The primers used are listed in the table below. All primers were ordered from MWG operon and were prepared to a working concentration of 1pmol/uL from 100pmol/uL stocks.
