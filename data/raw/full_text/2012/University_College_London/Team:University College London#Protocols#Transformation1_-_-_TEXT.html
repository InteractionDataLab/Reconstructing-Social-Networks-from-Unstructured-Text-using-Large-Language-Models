Transformation Protocol 1
Step 1 - Addition of BioBrick: To the still frozen competent cells, add 1 - 5 µL of the resuspended DNA to the 2ml tube.
Step 4 - Incubation: Close tube and incubate the cells on ice for 45 minutes.
Step 5 - Heat Shock: Heat shock the cells by immersion in a pre-heated water bath at 37ºC for 10 minutes.
Step 6 - Incubation: Incubate the cells on ice for 2 minutes.
Step 7 - Add media: Add 1.5ml of Lysogeny Broth and transfer to a falcon tube.
Step 8 - Incubation: Incubate the cells at 37ºC for 1 hour at RPM 550. 
Step 9 - Transfer: transfer the solution back into a 1.5ml Eppendorf and centrifuge
RPM: 14000
Time: 2 minutes
Temperature (18-25oC)
Step 10 - Resuspend:Remove supernatant and resuspend in 100ul LB
Step 11 - Plating: Spread the resuspended cell solution onto a selective nutrient agar plate. Place the plates in a 37°C static incubator, leave overnight (alternatively a 30°C static incubator over the weekend)
