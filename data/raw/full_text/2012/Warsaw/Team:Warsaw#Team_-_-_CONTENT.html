I am studying biology and psychology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences . So far I was researching mutations in POLG1 human gene, but this year I am beginning my adventure with embryology. Aside from science, I like traveling and taking photographs. I am also enthusiastic rock climber :)
<P><B>Krzysztof Szczepaniak</B></P>
I'm finishing my studies at the College of Interfaculty Individual
Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences but I'm going to stay in
Science business;) Beside biology, I like computer programming and I
try to develop my skills in this field. Outside the lab I am a scout
leader, I'm interested in foreign languages, astronomy and I love
everything connected with science-fiction and fantasy.<P><B>Magda Ghanim</B></P>
I'm studying biotechnology and chemistry at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Warsaw. My main areas of scientific interest are Genetics, Molecular Biology, and Analytic Chemistry. My B. Sc. thesis will investigate mutations of mitochondrial DNA after chemotherapy in leukemia patients. Aside from science, I love classical literature, ancient history, traveling, animals (I have two cute kitties and a guinea pig) and mountain hiking.<P><B>Monika Szewczyk</B></P>
I come from Przychojec, the most beautiful  village in south-east Poland. I am a student of chemistry and biotechnology at the College of Interfaculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Warsaw. My scientific interests include biophysical chemistry and molecular biology. I love traveling, meeting new people and cycling.<P><B>Elżbieta Jankowska</B></P>
I'm a fifth year student of Biotechnology, which means I'm going to spend next year working on my Masters thesis. My area of scientific interest includes ancient DNA, molecular phylogenetics, synthetic biology (of course:p) and anything I find interesting at the moment. Apart from that I like travelling, singing and sci-fi &amp; fantasy. <P><B>Weronika Krzynowek</B></P><CENTER><P>Weronika Krzynowek is twenty-one years old 
She's polite and always does as she's told 
For a girl her age, she's considerate and nice 
But she wants to be just like she's throwing the dice 

She doesn't mind living with her sister, dog, and cats
Though she'd rather share a home with spiders and bats
There she could reflect on the horrors she has invented 
and wander dark hallways alone and tormented 

But imagines dipping her in wax for his wax museum
He likes to experiment on her dog Abocrombie 
In the hopes of creating a horrible zombie 
So that he and her horrible zombie dog 
could go searching for victims in the London fog  

Her thoughts aren't only of ghoulish crime 
He likes to paint and read to pass some of the time
While other kids read books like &quot;Go Jane Go&quot;
Weronika's favorite author is Edgar Allen Poe.</P></CENTER><P><B>Anna Misiukiewicz</B></P>
I’m a last year student of biotechnology at the University of Warsaw. My Bachelor thesis was done at the Department of Applied Microbiology, so does Master. Usually, my lab partner is <I>Yersinia enterocolitica</I> but this summer I decided to make an exception and befriend <I>Bacillus subtilis</I>. I can’t imagine my life without a cup of black tea, weather forecast and visiting my hometown – Białystok. I dream of spending my holiday walking and taking some pictures with my old Zenit camera, but this year my fondness of bacteria turns out to be stronger ;)
<P><B>Nikodem Latocha</B></P>Hi, my name is Nikodem. I do my research in the Department of Immunology at the Medical University of Warsaw. I`m interested in sports, computers and science of course ;) I think iGEM is a great
opportunity to learn about synthetic biology and take part in a relatively young area of science.<P><B>INSTRUCTORS</B></P><P><B>prof. dr hab. Jacek Bielecki</B></P>Education: MSc, University of Warsaw, 1975 ;PhD, University of Warsaw, 1981 ;Associated professor, Warsaw University, 1995; Professor at University of Warsaw, 1996 ;Vice Dean of Faculty of Biology, 1996 - 1999, and 1999-2002
Research interests:
Molecular mechanisms of virulence of bacteria <I>Listeria monocytogenes</I>, especially the role of a hemolysin, listeriolysin O (LLO).
<P><B>dr. Radosław Stachowiak</B></P>
My adventure with biology and biotechnology dates back to 1995 when I became a biotechnology student at the University of Warsaw. In the year 2000 I completed my MSc thesis and I guess I couldn’t stop there so I immidiately started PhD studies. Now I’m done with studying and my job is to take care of students and introduce them into science. Still, I like being involved in crazy projects so characteristic of Sudents’ Societies. The more crazy and incredible project the better. I guess this is the case so here I am.
<P><B>dr. Takao Ishikawa</B></P>
Born in Tokyo, working and living in Warsaw, I am interested in
protein-protein interactions. In my research, I employ in silico
modeling of protein complexes and theirs verification by molecular
biology methods. I am not only fascinated by life science, but also
being in love with popularization of science. Giving lectures for
students, teachers, and children give me a lot of fun!</DIV><DIV id="sponsors" style="margin-right:10px;margin-left:10px"><CENTER>                                              </CENTER>  </DIV><DIV id="acknowledgements"><P><B>OUR SINCERE THANKS GO TO:</B></P>

Also, we send our heartfelt thanks to <B><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Slovenia">Slovenia Team</A></B> for sending us the CMV promoter.</DIV><DIV id="attribution"><P><B>Attribution</B></P><P>We had an ambitious project and very little time; therefore, we adopted a shift based work system in the wet lab. Some team members used to come early in the morning and after dinner their experiments were passed to others, who like working late.</P><P><B><I>Bacillus subtilis</I> construct</B></P>
The parts for <I> Bacillus subtilis</I> were designed by Elżbieta Jankowska, Krzysztof Szczepaniak, and Nikodem Latocha. The whole team helped in the lab work, which was mainly supervised by Ania Misiukiewicz, our chief microbiologist, whose skills and patience were crucial in this part of the project.<P><B>Mammalian construct</B></P>
The work was designed and performed mainly by Kaja Sabat. The whole team helped wherever they could. <P><B>Shuttle vector </B></P>

The work was mainly designed by Kaja. The whole team helped wherever they could.<P><B>Human practice</B></P>
Kaja, Krzysztof and Elżbieta went to the conference 'Numbers, Computers, Life', where Ela and Krzysztof gave a presentation, and all three of them presented a poster about last year's iGEM project. There they met Weronika Krzynowek, who joined our team in the summer.
The whole team ran the stand on the Biologists' Night at the Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw.
Dr. Radosław Stachowiak, our instructor, performed a presentation on the 2nd International Scientific Seminar &quot;Science-Society-Didactics&quot; on synthetic biology.<P><B>Wiki</B></P>
The website was coded by Weronika, our codemaster. The graphics and pictures were made by Elżbieta, our homemade artist. Kaja wrote the &quot;steps&quot; part. The whole team contributed to our wiki, which was corrected and edited by Magda Ghanim, the grammar nazi.<P><B>Fundrising</B></P>
Monika Szewczyk did a great job acquiring sponsors and rising funds. During the summer, Magda contributed to the organization of funds and invoices. Krzysztof helped in acquiring all the stamps we needed.</DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
