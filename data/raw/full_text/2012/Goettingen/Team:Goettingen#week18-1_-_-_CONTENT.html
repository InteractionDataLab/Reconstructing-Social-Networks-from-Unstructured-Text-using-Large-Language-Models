In addition, the following combinations with antibiotics were tested: with ampicillin (amp), with chloramphenicol (cm), with methionine, with methionine + amp and with methionine + cm. The experiment was performed in three technical replicates. </LI><LI>Observation &amp; Results: The strain Δtar_18C_tar has a resistance against chloramphenicol due to the biobrick plasmid pSB1C3. The strain Δtar_18C_rfp has a resistance against ampicillin due to the plasmid J62100. Both strains did not grow on any of the M9 plates at all. In contrast, both strains displayed growth and swimming on tryptone plates after 1 day. Also chemotaxis was observed. Methione had no influence on swimming or chemotaxis on the tryptone plates.</LI></UL><B>V_08_27_2 Test of chemical chemotaxis with BL21 tar library</B><UL><LI>Experiment: Tested attractants in Whatman paper: caffeine, D-aspartate, geraniol, 2-ethyl-hexanol, vanillin, sodium cyclamate, L-aspartate-4-benzyl. For full description of stocksolutions, look in the materials section. All attractants were used on tryptone and M9 swimming plates with and without chloramphenicol. The library was grown over night. In the morning, the culture was centrifuged 10 min for 1,5k X g. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in the remaining 100 µl LB-medium. 5 µl were dropped on 12 cm petridishes with the different swimming agar. The plates were incubated at 33°C overnight. The experiment was performed in three technical replicates. </LI><LI>Observation &amp; Results: Swimming was observed for tryptone swimming agar with and without chloramphenicol. M9 plates did not show swimming. Sodium cyclamate, 2-ethyl-hexanol and L-aspartate-4-benzyl showed the highest chemotactic behaviour. Overall chemotaxis was higher on tryptone swimming plates without chloramphenicol. </LI></UL></B></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE cellpadding="20 px" border="1" bordercolor="black" valign="top"><TBODY><TR bordercolor="black" valign="top"><TD width="900" bordercolor="black" valign="top"><B><H2>V08_28 </H2><B>V_08_28_1 Selection assay</B><UL><LI>Experiment: Continuation of experiment V_08_27_2.

- The agar was cut out at three different positions using a to the first mark shortened yellow Eppendorf tip respectively 
- The first section was cut out at the swimming front (I), and the next two (II, III) in a line behind the first one
- The tips with the agar pieces were inserted into a glas tube filled with 1 ml LB media, respectively
- The cultures war incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with approx. 180 rpm
- a 10^<SUP>-1</SUP> to 10^<SUP>-4</SUP> dilution series was prepared
- 100 µl of the 10^<SUP>-2</SUP> and the 10^<SUP>-4</SUP> dilution was plated on LB agar plates containing either ampicillin or chloramphenicol respecvtively
- the plates were incubated in an 33 °C incubator over night</LI><LI>Observation: The next day the colnies could be counted: 
CM containing plates <DIV style="text-indent:20px;">I: 10^-4: 7 colonies</DIV><DIV style="text-indent:20px;">II: 10^-4: 320 colonies</DIV><DIV style="text-indent:20px;">I: 10^-4: 330 colonies</DIV>
