V05_29
Insertion of tar into pUC18
Experiment:
Double digest of tar and pUC18 using EcoRI, PstI and Orange buffer (ThermoScientific) according to protocol . Gel extraction and purification of pUC18 and tar using peqGOLD Gel Extraction Kit (Peqlab). Ligation of tar into pUC18 using T4 DNA Ligase (Thermo Scientific).
V05_30
Transformation of DH10B with pUC18_TAR construct
Experiment:
Transformation was carried out according to protocol . Transformed DH10B were plated on LB-Amp plates (see here for recipe ). Transformation was successful.
V05_31
Preparation of pUC18_TAR
Experiment:
Inocculation of overnight cultures of 10 supposedly positive clones in liquid LB-Amp ( recipe ).
V06_01
Changing the XbaI site in the tar sequence via QuikChange
Experiment:
DNA was prepped using peqGOLD Miniprep Kit (Peqlab). A DNA test digest with EcoRI and XbaI was performed according to protocol and analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. Test digest showed 8 out of 10 clones contained the construct pUC18_TAR. QuikChange PCR was performed using designed primers and Pfu Turbo polymerase (see QuikChange protocol here ). Resulting construct was labeled pUC18_TAR_QC.
V06_02
Changing the XbaI site in the tar sequence via QuikChange
Experiment:
DpnI digest of QuikChange PCR product to get rid of the parent plasmid.
