University of Göttingen
Also known as Georgia Augusta, the University of Göttingen (german: Georg-August-Universität Göttingen) was named after the English King Georg the second and was founded in the year 1737. This year the University celebrates its 275th anniversary! As it is one of the oldest Universities in Germany, it has quite a lot of famous alumni that played a great role in the political and cultural history of Germany, e.g. Otto von Bismarck or the Brothers Grimm. They, together with five other professors, are known as the "Göttinger Sieben" ("Göttingen Seven"), who lost their offices after protesting against sovereignty of the kings of Hanover in 1837. Soon gaining in popularity and prestige, it is nowadays one of the highest-ranked universities in Germany, being associated with 44 Nobel laureates. According to the World University Rankings 2011/2012 of the Times Higher Education the Georg-August-University is ranked on place 69 and thus is the second best university in Germany. It was supported by the German "Initiative of Excellence" from 2007-2012.
Today 24,000 students are enrolled, more than 2,500 professors and other academics and a technical and administrative staff counting 10,000 members are employed. It has a broad spectrum of study courses reaching from medicine over horse sciences to law and philosophy.
