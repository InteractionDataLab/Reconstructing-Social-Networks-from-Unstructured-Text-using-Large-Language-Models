Amplification of flhDC gene
Experiment:
Using the isolated genomic DNA of E. coli (DH10B) as template, the gene flhDC was amplified by pfu polymerase according to the following protocol .
V05_10
Separation of flhDC
Experiment:
The amplicon was analysed and separated via application on an 1% agarose gel. As standard, Gene Ruler 1kb ladder (ThermoScientific) was used.
Observations & Results:
The gel featured a clear band at about 900 kb. The amplification of flhDC was successful.
V05_11
Purificaton of flhDC
Experiment:
The PCR product was purified using peqGOLD Gel Extraction Kit (Peqlab) according to the manual.
