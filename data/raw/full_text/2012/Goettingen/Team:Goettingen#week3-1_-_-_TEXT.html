V05_18: UV-mutation experiments with DH10B strain (E. coli)
Experiment:
In this experiment we want to mutate the DH10B strain with UV-light. Afterwards we want to screen for speed-mutations.
Observations & Results:
No colonies are grown. Maybe the drying phase after dropping the colonie was too long.
