V05_22
Preparation of plates, solutions
Experiment:
Preparation of 0.1 M IPTG solution. Preparation of LB-Amp-Xgal/IPTG agar plates.
V05_23
Amplifcation of the tar gene
Experiment:
PCR was performed with isolated genomic DNA from DH10B, forward and reverse primers of tar and using Pfu polymerase. Clean up with peqGOLD Gel Extraction Kit (Peqlab). A band at about 1.6 kb was detected. Amplification of tar was succhesfull.
V05_25
Preparation of chemocompetent cells, LB-media and agarplates. Transformation of BioBrick promoters
Experiment:
Chemocompetent cells and media were prepared like described here . For transformation of BioBrick promoters see Labbook group #2.
V05_27
Preparation of DH10B with promoter constructs
Experiment:
Over-night culture of DH10B cells. DNA was prepped using peqGOLD Miniprep Kit (Peqlab).
