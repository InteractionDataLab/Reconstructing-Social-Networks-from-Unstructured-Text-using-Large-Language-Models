Improved flagella shall boost bacteria Twelve students of the Master´s program “Biochemistry and Microbiology” of the University Göttingen took on a big task. This autumn, they plan to assert themselves with the results of their own research project at the European „international Genetically Engineered Machine Competition“ (iGEM) in Amsterdam.
Jan Erik Schliep, who became acquainted with iGEM already during his Bachelor studies at the Technical University Munich, quickly found allies amongst his fellow students when planning to participate in the competition. The competition, hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since 2003, awards a prize to persuasive student research projects in the field of synthetic biology. "This involves the application of biological knowledge strongly inspired by engineering", declares Schliep. Standardized biological components, partially modularly assembled, are specifically used in an entirely new context. Before the experimental work could start the usual steps, that are performed if a scientific project is set up, had to be run through. In the professors Heinz Neumann and Jörg Stülke proponents from the scientific field were found easily. The university supports the first iGEM Team of Göttingen with equipment laboratory workspaces. For the financing of consumables sponsors could be gained.
Flagella enable “Swimming”
Once all structures were established, six further students joined the team so that three subprojects could be processed. On the one hand the isolation of strains of the intestinal bacterium E. coli that can move preferably fast is intended. The already mentioned “Swimming” is enabled by the so-called flagella. At laboratory strains the flagella are often degenerated due to the profuse food availability of the nutrient media. “One of our groups develops a selection system for the fast strains”, explains team member Jan Kampf. A second group is supposed to modify one of the so-called chemoreceptors. With these plainest sensory organs E. coli can detect particular nutritive substances such as dextrose and single protein building blocks to move subsequently towards the location of higher substance concentration. These receptors are aimed to be altered in a way that they can specifically perceive other substances. In this project they are supposed to “learn” to trace substances that are released in the human body during inflammations. “If we succeed, these strains could be further advanced so that they accumulate for instance during chronic intestinal inflammations”, states Schliep. Thus, inflammations of the intestine could be displayed without eteroscopy. The third group develops das selections system for E. coli strains with altered chemoreceptors. Ideally we receive bacteria in the end that can, due to their improved flagella, move very fast towards the substance of desire.
Twelve team members
Since March the twelve team mebers work in the laboratory, each about one or two days per week. Once a week the results are discussed and the tasks for the following week defined, suppoted by Professor Neumann. “During summer holidays the amount of work will arise considerably”, comments Schliep. Besides the three subproject teams there are also people in authority for certain overlapping duties. These include purchasing as well as the documentation and putting online of the results on the iGEM website. The website can be edited till the end of September, then the jury commence operations. “Of those who may present their projects at the European Jamboree on 2nd October in Amsterdam, about 30 to 40 percent will go to the international finals in Boston a month later”, declares Kampf. The iGEM team of Göttingen has then left five months in the laboratory.

Congress of the strategy process "biotechnology 2020+"
On the 28th of June, 2012 the third annual congress of the strategy process "biotechnology 2020+" took place in Berlin, Café Moskau. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research started the initiative in the year 2010 to promote the next generation of biotechnological processes. The strategy congress was initiated to give experts from different fields the possibility to exchange ideas for new methods or applications concerning Biotechnology. Be it in medicine, the industry or in environmental sectors everybody is searching for new ideas that offer environmentally friendly, more efficient and lower-cost processes and biotechnology has an unknown potential that could eventually answer open questions. During the congress still existing problems and new ideas were discussed in workshops and presented at the end of the day. Nearly 200 researchers from the industry, science and politics gathered for the congress and among them undergraduate students from all over Germany. Why did the students participate and what did they have in common? All of them were members of one of the eleven German iGEM teams.
Thus the “Biotechnology 2020+” did not only serve as an exchange and communication platform for German researchers but also as the first meeting of the German iGEM teams. Each team was represented by at least three team members and presented a poster describing their project. The remaining time was used quite efficient: new ideas supporting Synthetic Biology were gathered, common problems were discussed and most importantly ties were established between the teams, in order to enable future cooperation. One of the main questions of the discussion was: “How can we bring Synthetic Biology closer to the general society?” This question occupied all of them for it is always important to consider how a project could have an impact on people´s life or the environment. Within the framework of their meeting they agreed to conduct a collective “Synthetic Biology Day” on the 25th of August in order to inform the public about Synthetic Biology and help to dispel existing doubts.
After the conference an article was published on "Biotechnologie.de" a homepage of the federal ministry of education and science. Click here to be redirected to the article!

Open letter concerning “Biotechnology in our day’s society“
Dear members of parliament, dear Dr. Schavan,
Dear members of the country council, dear Mrs. Wanka,
We are 12 junior scientists attending the master program “Microbiology and Biochemistry” at the University of Göttingen. We take part in this year’s iGEM competition and as part of our work we interviewed people about their perception and opinion of Synthetic Biology and genetic engineering in general. To this end, we generated a survey that has been answered by over 300 participants. The survey’s results were later presented and discussed at an information evening together with experts from science, journalism, bioethics and industry.
Firstly, we wanted to know how well the public is acquainted with the fields Synthetic Biology and genetic engineering. Furthermore, we were interested in society’s attitude towards these topics and trust in science. Through asking selective questions we aimed to assess the amount of previous knowledge. Thereupon we were able to evaluate our further questions in relation to the corresponding level of information.
The survey shows that the majority of interviewees can place biological terms correctly. However, most of them felt like they were not informed on scientific topics as well as they could have been. The results suggested that the internet represent the primary source of information. As a neutral source, the internet platform “biotechnologie.de” (Initiative of “Federal Ministry of Education and Research”) is already established; however our experience shows that it is widely unknown. Introducing impartial information sources that are accessible throughout the general public would possibly take the edge off of current topics like “Danger from genes” in the food industry. We discussed at length whether the responsibility of spreading info on the subject lies with politics, the industry or even educational institutions like universities or schools. We came to the conclusion that scientists and students, which are arguably at the primary stage of information generation, may be able to inform the public with governmental support in an objective way. One could, for example, organize information booths and meetings as all German iGEM teams have done on the “Synthetic Biology Day”. Financial support and a central organization could help realize those projects.
Now coming to the next big issue, trust in science, which is generally there, but there are differences concerning genetic engineering in food, dependent on age groups. As may have been expected there is a significant difference between the younger and older generations with respect to dealing with genetic engineering in everyday life. Generally speaking, younger participants are better informed and more prone to accepting and using genetically engineered products. Moreover, our survey clearly indicates that education and acceptance of genetic engineering correlate!
Lastly, one big point of discussion was whether or not a labeling of genetically engineered food or other products that are produced via biotechnological processes makes sense or not. The majority of interviewees come down in favor of a labeling of these products. From our point of view, an impartial education is able to take away fear of scientifically unfounded risks.
With this letter we aim to show the public attitude towards Synthetic Biology and genetic engineering and, more importantly, where we see chances and possibilities to put these topics into focus.
We have tried to contribute to public relations by organizing our own information meeting. Feel free to visit our homepage https://2012.igem.org/Team:Goettingen . Additionally, you can find out more about this year’s iGEM competition here: https://2012.igem.org/Main_Page .
Sincerely,
