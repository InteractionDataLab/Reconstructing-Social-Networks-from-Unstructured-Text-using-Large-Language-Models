Hi everybody! My name is Alicia and I am a member of the iGEM team Göttingen. I just earned my Bachelor's degree of Biological Sciences at the University of Bonn where I majored
in Microbiology and Biotechnology. I am currently attending the Master's program Microbiology and
Biochemistry at the University of Göttingen specializing in Molecular Genetics, Microbial Cell Biology
and Biochemistry. This will be my first iGEM participation and I am eagerly looking forward to working

Hello my name is Anna and I am a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Master in Göttingen, as well.
First a short story about how I decided to become a biologist: When I was in school, we had a practical week of genetics
with a professor from an university. Since this laboratory experience, I decided to study biology and to become a scientist!
I did my bachelor thesis in the department of Molecular Structural Biology in Göttingen, where I became a fan of proteins.
Participating the iGEM team means very much to me because I am looking forward to work independently and I like to develop new ideas

Osnabrück and currently I am planning to further specialize in the field of Microbiology and Genetics. I decided to
participate in the iGEM competition because of the possibility to plan a complete project and to work independently
in a group with further students. Of course, I hope to learn a lot and meet interesting new people at the jamborees! <B>Focus Group: <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Goettingen/Focus_Groups#group1">#1 - Selection / Swimming</A></B><B>Additional jobs:</B> Human Practice, Homepage content</P></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE><TBODY><TR valign="top" align="left"><TD style="padding: 0pt 20px 0pt 0pt;" width="650 px"><FONT face="Verdana" size="+1"><B>Bianca Genenncher</B></FONT><FONT face="Verdana" size="-1"><P align="justify" style="line-height:1.6em">
Hello everybody. My name is Bianca Genenncher and it is my second year of the Biochemistry and Microbiology Master
of the University of Göttingen. During my Bachelor studies in Göttingen my main focus pointed towards the Molecular Plant
Biology examining the plant´s molecular reaction to invading pathogens. Last year, I was studying in Scotland at the
University of Aberdeen. I really enjoyed my time abroad working together with students from other countries
with interesting cultural backgrounds, but I also admire the beautiful nature of course.
This is my first iGEM participation and I like being a part of the first iGEM team of the University of Göttingen.
I am highly motivated to start doing the experiments and gain the first
experience designing own experiments. Another reason for me to participate is the internationality of this
competition. I am looking forward to have rewarding discussions about the results or different ways to
reach the aim with my team members.<B>Focus Group: <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Goettingen/Focus_Groups#group3">#3 - Chemoreceptor Library</A></B><B>Additional jobs:</B> Organization Team, Human Practice, Homepage content, BioBrick Annotation

I received my Bachelor of Science in the field of Molecular Biology 2011 also at this University. Last year after my Bachelor, I was doing an

us are very motivated and we have a lot of fun doing our experiments. I think that iGEM offers the possibility to work independently and to learn

As well as all the others around, I am a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry master´s program at the University of Göttingen. Currently, I am in my second semester. I finished my bachelor in August 2011 at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in the field of Molecular Biotechnology after six semesters of study. During my time in Munich, I heard of iGEM for the first time. Some of my former fellow students participated in an iGEM Team for the TUM in 2011. Their stories stunned me very much and I wanted to join a team by myself as fast as possible. I worked for my Bachelor's thesis at the Chair of Proteomics of Prof. Küster at the Faculty of Life Science (TUM), where I had a lot planning and working on my own. By doing this, I had a lot of fun and I think to re-experience this during our iGEM project.

Hello everybody, my name is Jan Kampf and I am pursuing also the MSc/PhD program in
&quot;Microbiology and Biochemistry&quot; at the Georg-August University of Göttingen.
I received my Bachelor of Science in the field of Molecular Biology in 2011 at
the Faculty of Biology of the University of Göttingen as well. For my bachelor
thesis &quot;Insights into Mammalian SIRT6 Function in Cellular Stress Response&quot; I
worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen. During
my time as a bachelor's student in the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry
I had the opportunity to work in an environment with people from various countries
raised in different and diverse cultures. It was a great time for me and motivated
me to spend a period of time working again on a project, which allows earning
experience in autonomous efforts and planning of our project. So I am really looking
forward to our iGEM project for the opportunity to work independently in a team of
young students as well as the opportunity to present our work and the results to a
multicultural audience and the exchange of experiences during the time of the iGEM
project of the other teams.

Hello, my name is Leo and I am also a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Masters
program at the University of Göttingen. I chose this Master program because I liked the
combination and variety of the special emphasis. In 2011, I finished my Bachelor with a

very proud to be a part of the first iGEM team of Göttingen. I think the participation

Hello everybody, my name is Nikolas Rakebrandt and I am currently studying in the second semester of the MSc &quot;Microbiology and Biochemistry&quot; program in Göttingen. Before my career as a scientist, I made a little detour and hold
a BSc in Business Administration and Economics from the University of Passau. After this, I acquired
my Biology BSc in Göttingen with a thesis about effector proteins of plant pathogenic fungi. I am
really looking forward to iGEM because it will be &quot;our&quot; project and we will be able to work and plan
on this autonomously. I think this will be very challenging and fun, not to mention that we will probably
learn a great deal!

When I am not busy with PCRs, cloning or studying I am very much into sports like football, surfing or basketball.
Also, I like travelling whenever there is time (and money) or just being outside.<B>Focus Group: <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Goettingen/Focus_Groups#group2">#2 - Speed Improvement</A></B><B>Additional jobs:</B> Organization Team, BioBrick Annotation

Hello everybody!
I am Patrick and also student of the Masters program &quot;Microbiology and Biochemistry&quot; at
the Georg-August University in Göttingen.
I earned my Bachelor of science at the Leibniz University in Hannover. I was member of
the Schierwater-workgroup
in the Institute of ecology and evolution of the Stiftung Tierärtzliche Hochschule Hannover
for over 2 years. My workfield was
taxis-behaviour and potential early-evolution neuro-systems on <I>Trichoplax adhaerens</I>.
I gathered many experiences in the workfield of genetics and experimental biology.
Within my Master I want to complement this experiences with detailed biochemical knowledge.
In the beginning of this year fellow students told me that they want to participate
at the iGEM competition. The interesting Project catched me so I joined the team immediately.
I think this Project is also a good first experience of scientific projectmanagement and
financing.

Also, my speed is a huge help since the lab is located on the &quot;Faßberg&quot; aka the little brother of Mount Everest, and the students are only equipped with bikes.
