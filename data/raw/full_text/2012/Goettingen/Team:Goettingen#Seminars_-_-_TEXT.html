Weekly Seminars
The iGEM Team Göttingen meets once a week for information exchange on current topics concerning officialism but also to discuss the results of the experiments and to find new solutions for upcoming problems. Moreover, papers on diverse topics related to synthetic biology are presented by the students. Presentations are given in English.
