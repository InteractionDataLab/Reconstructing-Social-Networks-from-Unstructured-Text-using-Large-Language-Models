V08_06
V08_06_1 2nd round: Ethanol precipitation of mutated plasmids
Experiment:
The ethanol precipitation was performed according to protocol .
V08_06_2 2nd round: Transformation of electrocompetent cells with the mutant plasmid mixture
Experiment:
Electrocompetent cells were prepared according to protocol . The transformation was performed according to the established protocol .
V08_07
V08_07_1 2nd round: Analysis of transforamtion V08_06
Experiment:
Plates and liquid culture were investigated.
Observations & Results:
Neither the plates nor the liquid culture exhibited bacterial growth. A test gel of the ethano precipitated ligation revealed that, again, our DNA material was lost during the process.
V08_07_2 2nd round: Mutagenesis PCR was set up again, 1000 µL
Experiment:
PCR according to protocol .
V08_08
V08_08_1 2nd round: PCR purification
Experiment:
The purification was carried out with the peqGOLD Gel extraction Kit (PeqLab) following the user manual. Elution in 100 µL EB.
Observations & Results:
Again, we lost a significant amount of DNA material. The subsequent steps (digestion, ligation, transformation) were not carried through because the diversity could not be reached!!
V08_08_2 2nd round: Mutagenesis PCR was set up again, 1000 µL
Experiment:
PCR according to protocol .
V08_09
V08_09_1 2nd round: PCR purification of V08_08_2
Experiment:
The purification was performed using the peqGOLD Gel extraction Kit (PeqLab) following the user manual. Elution in 100 µL EB.
Observations & Results:
Again, we lost a significant amount of DNA material. The subsequent steps (digestion, ligation, transformation) were not carried through because the diversity could not be reached!! We decided to do a test PCR to see whether our protocol worked for the second mutagenesis round.
V08_10
V08_10 2nd round: Test-PCR
Experiment:
The PCR was performed according to the established protocol in a volume of 16 µL.
Observations & Results:
The corresponding agarose gel showed a band of the expected size. This indicated that our PCR worked well!
