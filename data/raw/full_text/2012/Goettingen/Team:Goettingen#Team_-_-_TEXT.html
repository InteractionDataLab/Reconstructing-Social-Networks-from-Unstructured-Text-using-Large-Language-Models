Alicia Illen
Hi everybody! My name is Alicia and I am a member of the iGEM team Göttingen. I just earned my Bachelor's degree of Biological Sciences at the University of Bonn where I majored in Microbiology and Biotechnology. I am currently attending the Master's program Microbiology and Biochemistry at the University of Göttingen specializing in Molecular Genetics, Microbial Cell Biology and Biochemistry. This will be my first iGEM participation and I am eagerly looking forward to working on our project. It will be an opportunity to work independently and on our own responsibility and I hope I will be able to  learn a lot about lab work in general. I am looking forward to take part in the international competition to gain valuable experiences that will broaden my horizon.

Anna Maria Köhler
Hello my name is Anna and I am a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Master in Göttingen, as well. First a short story about how I decided to become a biologist: When I was in school, we had a practical week of genetics with a professor from an university. Since this laboratory experience, I decided to study biology and to become a scientist! I did my bachelor thesis in the department of Molecular Structural Biology in Göttingen, where I became a fan of proteins. Participating the iGEM team means very much to me because I am looking forward to work independently and I like to develop new ideas in a group of students.

Berit Haßing
My name is Berit Haßing and I am a member of the iGEM team of the Georg-August University Göttingen. As most of the other team members I am currently in the second semester of the Master study course “Microbiology and Biochemistry” and I really enjoy studying here in Göttingen! Last year, I gained my Bachelor´s degree in the Department of Microbiology of the University of Osnabrück and currently I am planning to further specialize in the field of Microbiology and Genetics. I decided to participate in the iGEM competition because of the possibility to plan a complete project and to work independently in a group with further students. Of course, I hope to learn a lot and meet interesting new people at the jamborees!

Bianca Genenncher
Hello everybody. My name is Bianca Genenncher and it is my second year of the Biochemistry and Microbiology Master of the University of Göttingen. During my Bachelor studies in Göttingen my main focus pointed towards the Molecular Plant Biology examining the plant´s molecular reaction to invading pathogens. Last year, I was studying in Scotland at the University of Aberdeen. I really enjoyed my time abroad working together with students from other countries with interesting cultural backgrounds, but I also admire the beautiful nature of course. This is my first iGEM participation and I like being a part of the first iGEM team of the University of Göttingen. I am highly motivated to start doing the experiments and gain the first experience designing own experiments. Another reason for me to participate is the internationality of this competition. I am looking forward to have rewarding discussions about the results or different ways to reach the aim with my team members.

Corinna Krüger
Hello, my name is Corinna Krüger and I am currently in the second semester of the Biochemistry and Microbiology Master at the University of Göttingen. I received my Bachelor of Science in the field of Molecular Biology 2011 also at this University. Last year after my Bachelor, I was doing an internship at the University of Göteborg, Sweden. This is my first iGEM participation and I am really glad being a member of the team. All of us are very motivated and we have a lot of fun doing our experiments. I think that iGEM offers the possibility to work independently and to learn organizing experiments. I am really looking forward to the jamboree in Amsterdam. I hope to get to know other teams from different countries and that we can exchange our experiments in lab work.

Jan Erik Schliep
As well as all the others around, I am a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry master´s program at the University of Göttingen. Currently, I am in my second semester. I finished my bachelor in August 2011 at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in the field of Molecular Biotechnology after six semesters of study. During my time in Munich, I heard of iGEM for the first time. Some of my former fellow students participated in an iGEM Team for the TUM in 2011. Their stories stunned me very much and I wanted to join a team by myself as fast as possible. I worked for my Bachelor's thesis at the Chair of Proteomics of Prof. Küster at the Faculty of Life Science (TUM), where I had a lot planning and working on my own. By doing this, I had a lot of fun and I think to re-experience this during our iGEM project.

Jan Kampf
Hello everybody, my name is Jan Kampf and I am pursuing also the MSc/PhD program in "Microbiology and Biochemistry" at the Georg-August University of Göttingen. I received my Bachelor of Science in the field of Molecular Biology in 2011 at the Faculty of Biology of the University of Göttingen as well. For my bachelor thesis "Insights into Mammalian SIRT6 Function in Cellular Stress Response" I worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen. During my time as a bachelor's student in the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry I had the opportunity to work in an environment with people from various countries raised in different and diverse cultures. It was a great time for me and motivated me to spend a period of time working again on a project, which allows earning experience in autonomous efforts and planning of our project. So I am really looking forward to our iGEM project for the opportunity to work independently in a team of young students as well as the opportunity to present our work and the results to a multicultural audience and the exchange of experiences during the time of the iGEM project of the other teams.

Leonhard Nagel
Hello, my name is Leo and I am also a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Masters program at the University of Göttingen. I chose this Master program because I liked the combination and variety of the special emphasis. In 2011, I finished my Bachelor with a special focus on Genomic and Applied Microbiology at the University of Göttingen. I am very proud to be a part of the first iGEM team of Göttingen. I think the participation in the iGEM competition will improve my lab skills and will prepare me also for my following scientific career. Furthermore, I hope our project will be successful and enables us to take part in the regional and international jamboree.

Nikolas Rakebrandt
Hello everybody, my name is Nikolas Rakebrandt and I am currently studying in the second semester of the MSc "Microbiology and Biochemistry" program in Göttingen. Before my career as a scientist, I made a little detour and hold a BSc in Business Administration and Economics from the University of Passau. After this, I acquired my Biology BSc in Göttingen with a thesis about effector proteins of plant pathogenic fungi. I am really looking forward to iGEM because it will be "our" project and we will be able to work and plan on this autonomously. I think this will be very challenging and fun, not to mention that we will probably learn a great deal!
When I am not busy with PCRs, cloning or studying I am very much into sports like football, surfing or basketball. Also, I like travelling whenever there is time (and money) or just being outside.

Patrick Reinke
Hello everybody! I am Patrick and also student of the Masters program "Microbiology and Biochemistry" at the Georg-August University in Göttingen. I earned my Bachelor of science at the Leibniz University in Hannover. I was member of the Schierwater-workgroup in the Institute of ecology and evolution of the Stiftung Tierärtzliche Hochschule Hannover for over 2 years. My workfield was taxis-behaviour and potential early-evolution neuro-systems on Trichoplax adhaerens. I gathered many experiences in the workfield of genetics and experimental biology. Within my Master I want to complement this experiences with detailed biochemical knowledge. In the beginning of this year fellow students told me that they want to participate at the iGEM competition. The interesting Project catched me so I joined the team immediately. I think this Project is also a good first experience of scientific projectmanagement and financing.

Simon Uhse
My name is Simon, I am currently studying in the Biochemistry and Microbiology Master´s programme at the University of Göttingen. Last year, I finished my Bachelor with an emphasis on Molecular Biology at the University of Göttingen. Next to the university courses I really enjoy to play tablesoccer in my freetime. I am a member of a club which competes with other teams in a German wide national league. This year, I joined the iGEM team to participate in an interesting competition as well as to improve my lab skills. I am eager to organize and develop a project together with other students and just like to have a fun time with them. Hopefully, we are able to get to the international jamboree in Boston and meet lots of other students with worthwhile ideas and projects.

Flash Coli
Hey everybody! My name is Flash Coli and I am known as the fastest gut bacterium on earth. There are many rumors on how I was born but I can assure you some of them are hughely exaggerated and not very pleasant! This summer I supported the Team Göttingen during their work for iGEM. As a big fancier of cloning, growing cultures and BioBrick design I am the perfect addition to this team. Also, my speed is a huge help since the lab is located on the "Faßberg" aka the little brother of Mount Everest, and the students are only equipped with bikes. Therefore, I can easily take all kinds of equipment from the university buildings to our lab at the MPI.
I am looking forward to meet all the other European teams in Amsterdam. Stay Coli!
Focus Group: Can work in all groups simultaneously.
Additional jobs: Being faster than a flash.
