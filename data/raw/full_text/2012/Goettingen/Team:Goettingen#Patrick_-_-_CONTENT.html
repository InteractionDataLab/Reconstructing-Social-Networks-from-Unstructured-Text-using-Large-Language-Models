I just earned my Bachelor's degree of Biological Sciences at the University of Bonn where I majored
in Microbiology and Biotechnology. I am currently attending the Master's program Microbiology and
Biochemistry at the University of Göttingen specializing in Molecular Genetics, Microbial Cell Biology
and Biochemistry. This will be my first iGEM participation and I am eagerly looking forward to working
on our project. It will be an opportunity to work independently and on our own responsibility and to
learn a lot about lab work in general. I am looking forward to take part in the international competition
to gain valuable experiences that will broaden my horizon.

Hello my name is Anna and I'm a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Master in Göttingen as well.
When I was in school, we had a practical week with a professor from an university. Since this laboratory
experience, I decided to study biology and to become a scientist! I did my bachelor thesis in structural
biochemistry in Göttingen, where I became a fan of proteins. Participating the iGEM Team means very much
to me, because I'm looking forward to work independently and I like to develop new ideas in a group of students.

Hello everybody! Welcome on our home page!
My name is Berit Haßing and I am a member of the iGEM team of the Georg-August University Göttingen. As most of the other team members I am currently in the second semester of the master study course “microbiology and biochemistry” and I really enjoy studying here in Göttingen! Last year I gained my bachelor degree in the department of microbiology of the University of Osnabrück and currently I am planning to further specialize in the field of microbiology and genetics.  I decided to participate in the iGEM competition because of the possibility plan a complete project and to work independently in a group with further students. Of course I hope to learn a lot and meet interesting new people at the jamborees! 
Greetings
Berit

Hello everybody and welcome to our wiki. My name is Bianca Genenncher and I am a member of the first iGEM team of
the University of Göttingen. It is my second year of the Biochemistry and Microbiology Master in Göttingen and I
just finished my first lab rotation in the microbe-plant interaction department of Prof. Schirawski. During my
Bachelor studies in Göttingen my main focus pointed towards the molecular plant biology examining the plant´s
reaction on invading pathogens. Last year, I was studying in Scotland at the University of Aberdeen. I really
enjoyed my time abroad working together with students from other countries with interesting cultural backgrounds.
This is my first iGEM participation. I am highly motivated to start doing the experiments and gain the first
experience designing own experiments. Another reason for me to participate is the internationality of this
competition. I am also looking forward to have rewarding discussions about the results or different ways to
reach the aim with my kind team members.

As well as all of the others, I'm a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Masters
program at the University of Göttingen and I'm currently in my first semester. I finished
my Bachelor in August 2011 at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in the field of
Molecular Biotechnology after six semesters of study. During my time in Munich, I heard
of iGEM for the first time. Some of my former fellow students participated in an iGEM
Team for the TUM and their stories stunned my very much and I wanted to join a team by
myself. I worked for my Bachelor's Thesis at the Chair of Proteomics of Prof. Küster at
the Faculty of Life Science at the TUM, were I had a lot to work on my own and plan my
work. By doing this, I had a lot of fun and I think to re-experience this during our iGEM
project.

Hello everybody, my name is Jan Kampf and I am pursuing also the MSc/PhD program in
&quot;Microbiology and Biochemistry&quot; at the Georg-August University of Goettingen.
I received my Bachelor of Science in the field of Molecular Biology in 2011 at
the Faculty of Biology of the University of Goettingen as well. For my bachelor
 thesis &quot;Insights into Mammalian SIRT6 Function in Cellular Stress Response&quot; I
 worked at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Goettingen. During
 my time as a bachelor's student in the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry
  I had the opportunity to work in an environment with people from various countries
  raised in different and diverse cultures. It was a great time for me and motivated
  me to spend a period of time working again on a project, which allows earning
  experience in autonomous efforts and planning of our project. So I am really looking
  forward to our iGEM project for the opportunity to work independently in a team of
  young students as well  as the opportunity to present our work and the results to a
  multicultural audience and the exchange of experiences during the time of the iGEM
  project of the other teams.</P></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE><TBODY><TR valign="top" align="left"><TD style="padding: 0pt 20px 0pt 0pt;" width="650 px"><FONT face="Verdana" size="-1"><H2><B><A name="Leon">Leonhard Nagel</A></B></H2><P align="justify" style="line-height:1.6em">
Hello, my name is Leo and I am also a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Masters
program at the University of Göttingen.  I chose this Master program because I liked the
combination and variety of the special emphasis. In 2011 I finished my Bachelor with a
special focus on genomic and applied microbiology at the University of Göttingen. I am
very proud to be a part of the first iGEM team of Göttingen. I think the participation
in the iGEM competition will improve my lab skills and will prepare me also for my
following scientific career. Furthermore, I hope our project will be successful and
enables us to take part in the regional and international Jamboree.</P></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE><TBODY><TR valign="top" align="left"><TD style="padding: 0pt 20px 0pt 0pt;" width="650px"><FONT face="Verdana" size="-1"><H2><B><A name="Niko">Nikolas Rakebrandt</A></B></H2><P align="justify" style="line-height:1.6em">
My name is Nikolas Rakebrandt and I am currently in the first semester of the MSc &quot;Microbiology and
Biochemistry&quot; program in Göttingen. Before my career as a scientist, I made a little detour and hold
 a BSc in Business Administration and Economics from the University of Passau. After this, I acquired
  my Biology BSc in Göttingen with a thesis about effector proteins of plant pathogenic fungi. I am
  really looking forward to iGEM because it will be &quot;our&quot; project and we will be able to work and plan
  on this autonomously. I think this will be very challenging and fun, not to mention that we will probably
  learn a great deal!

When I am not busy with PCRs, cloning or studying I am very much into sports like football, surfing or basketball.
 Also I like travelling whenever there is time (and money) or just being outside.

As a big fancier of genetics, microbiology and biochemistry, I recently started to study Microbiology and

academic degree of bachelor of science in biology at the Humboldt University of Berlin. During these
studies I also specialized on the already mentioned fields. This year is the first I participate in iGEM

enjoy to play tablesoccer in my freetime. I am a member of a club which competes with other

an interesting competition as well as improve my lab skills. I am eager to organize and
develop a project together with other students and just like to have a fun time with them.
Hopefully, we are able to get to the jamboree in europe and meet lots of other students with
worthwhile ideas and projects.
