For Parts K777000 - K777008 the plasmid maps were constructed in ApE. Within the maps you will find annotated features, as well. To gain more information about the parts submitted by the iGEM team Göttingen 2012 click here .
Moreover, the parts were completely sequenced (except for K777000) and aligned. The original data and the reviewed data are provided in the respective Zip- files.

Characterization of constitutive promoters by qrtPCR
CP (crossing point) values and relative reinforcments of promoters from the Anderson Family :J23100, J23104, J23105, J23106, J23109, J23112, J23113, J23114
The CP values ​​of the reference housekeeping genes (hkg) are reduced by the value of 3.32 for the dilution which have been used for the reference cDNA in the experiment. For detailed information of generation of data and data analyzes click here .
