#1 Selection / Swimming - 8th Week
Back to overview
V06_18
V-Gradiant agar plates (Variation of V06_14)
Experiment:
This time, the plates were poured in three steps. This should result in a more directed, triangular gradient. Furthermore, the bacteria were dropped on random spots, to identify the best dropping position.
V06_21
Swimmimg assay with M9-agar and Whatman-paper
Experiment:
"M9 agar plates" (4 mL 100% glycerol, 80 mL 5x M9 salt solution, 400 µL CaCl2*2H20 [20 mg/mL], 400 µL MgSO4 [0.12 g/mL], 0.3% agar, add 400 mL H2O) were produced and used for swimming assays, as explained in methods. The Whatman papers was incorporated with 100 µL of a 50 mM aspartate solution.
Observations & Results:
After about 15h were no swimming visible. The only exception was the BL21 strain, which showed a little swimming.
