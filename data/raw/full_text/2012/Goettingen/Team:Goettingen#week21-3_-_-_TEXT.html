V09_17
Synthesis of cDNA and qrtPCR
Experiment:
cDNA synthesis of RNA from V09_16 was performed using Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen).
qrtPCR with promoter constructs was performed, for a detailed protocol click here .
Observations & Results:
CP-values of triplets showed values in a range which were useful for analysis via the 2–ΔΔCT (Livak) method of expression rates.
V09_17-23
Generation of BioBrick pSB1C3_TAR_QC without promoter
Experiment:
TAR_QC was cloned into pSB1C3 without the promoter constructs.
Observations & Results:
This part is now ready to be send in as BioBrick (see our submitted parts ).
