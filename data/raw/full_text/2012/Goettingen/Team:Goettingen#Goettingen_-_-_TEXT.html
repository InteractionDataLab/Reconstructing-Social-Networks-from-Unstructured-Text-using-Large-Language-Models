Göttingen
The city of Göttingen has approximately 120.000 residents and is located in the heart of Germany, Lower Saxony. It was first mentioned in the year 953, achieved city rights in 1230 and is now the sixth greatest city in the Lower Saxony. Göttingen is surrounded by a beautiful and interesting landscape. It is located in the middle of numerous forestlands and two national parks are situated in close vicinity. Moreover, a mountain range called "Harz" is just a short drive away and provides various leisure activities. Bigger cities, for instance Hannover or Kassel, can be reached easily by train or car. Göttingen offers a great variety of cultural events, for example theaters and musicals, classical and modern concerts and city fairs. Furthermore, Göttingen has to offer a beautiful historic village. Numerous ancient half-timber houses contribute to the old town's medieval charm.
With approximately 20 % of the residents being students, Göttingen is a typical historic university city and nearly everybody is somehow connected to the university; be it through work, friends or family. Due to its student-like flair, Göttingen has developed its own little tradition. For a doctoral candidate, it is common to climb the landmark of Göttingen, the "Gänseliesel" (engl. "Goose girl") and to bring flowers and kiss the statue. This makes the "Gänseliesel" the most kissed girl in Germany!
