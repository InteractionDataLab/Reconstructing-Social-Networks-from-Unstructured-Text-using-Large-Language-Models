#3 Chemoreceptor Library - 13th Week
Back to overview
V07_24
2nd round: Analysis of plates and liquid culture V07_20
Experiment:
14 clones were transferred to a 5 mL liquid culture (LB + CM) and incubated over night at 37 °C, 180 rpm. The liquid culture was centrifuged at 4800 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min. The pellet was stored at -20 °C.
Observations & Results:
Both the liquid culture and the plates exhibited bacterial growth.
V07_25
V07_25_1 2nd round: Plasmid preparation of clones 1-14 for subsequent sequencing
Experiment:
Plasmid preparation was performd with peqGOLD Plasmid Miniprep Kit (PeqLab) following the user manual. DNA concentrations were determined via nanodrop for subsequent sequencing.
V07_25_2 2nd round: Saturated mutagenesis PCR 200 µL (repeat) and clean-up
Experiment:
The PCR was set up following the protocol from week 10 . Elution in 2 x 50 µL.
Observations & Results:
The corresponding agarose gel showed bands of the expected sizes. However, we apparently did lose DNA material. Later analysis suggested that we used the wrong Kit (peqGOLD Gel extraction Kit (PeqLab)) for this clean-up.
V07_26
V07_26_1 2nd round: Digestion DpnI/BsaI, 100 µL and subsequent clean-up
Experiment:
The digestion was performed following the established protocol from week 10 .
Observations & Results:
The corresponding agarose gel showed bands of the expected sizes. However, we apparently did lose DNA material. Later analysis suggested that we used the wrong Kit (peqGOLD Gel extraction Kit (PeqLab)instead of peqGOLD Cycle-pure Kit (PeqLab)) for this clean-up. Continuous bug beginning V07_25!
V07_26_2 2nd round: Ligation, 200 µL
Experiment:
The ligation was performed following the established protocol from week 10 . Incubation over night at 16 °C.
V07_27
V07_27_1 2nd round: Ethanol precipitation of ligation V07_26
Experiment:
The ethanol precipitaion was performed following the established protocol from week 10 .
Observations & Results:
The corresponding agarose gel did not show any bands, meaning that we lost our DNA material. We could not determine where we went wrong, the transformation was carried out anyhow.
V07_27_2 2nd round: Transformation of electrocompetent cells with mutant plasmid mixture
Experiment:
The preparation of electrocompetent cells and subsequent transformation were performed following the established protocol from week 10 .
V07_27_3 2nd round: Sequencing of isolated mutant plasmids V07_25
Experiment:
For the sequencing reactions (clones 1-14) we used primer VF2. Again, we wanted to check whether our method had introduced a bias.
Observations & Results:
We could confirm that a bias was not introduced.
