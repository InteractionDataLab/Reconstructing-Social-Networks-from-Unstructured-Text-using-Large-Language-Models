#3 Chemoreceptor Library - 17th Week
Back to overview
V08_20
V08_20_1 Attempt b: increasing the library diversity!
Experiment:
A PCR (1000 µL) using the 2nd round primers (Tar6973 for and Tar6973 rev) and the liquid culture pellet Miniprep that was used at V07_25 as template was performed. Protocol according to week 10 . By doing this and later combine the products, the diversity can be increased. Purification was carried our using the peqGOLD Cycle-pure Kit (PeqLab) with Miniprep Kit columns following the user manual.
Observations & Results:
The corresponding agarose gel showed a band of the expected size.
V08_20_2 2nd round: Plasmid preparation from pellets #1-#4 V08_17
Experiment:
peqGOLD Xchange Plasmid Midi Kit (PeqLab) was used following the user manual. Elution in 100 µL H2O. Stored at -20 °C.
Observations & Results:
DNA concentrations were determined as follows using nanodrop:
#1 - 521 ng/µL
#2 - 1035 ng/µL
#3 - 2145 ng/µL
#4 - 1103 ng/µL
V08_21
V08_21_1 Attempt b: DpnI/BsaI digest and subsequent purification
Experiment:
The digest and purification was performed following the protocol from week 10 .
Observations & Results:
The corresponding agarose gel showed a band of the expected size.
V08_21_2 Attempt b: Ligation, 2000 µL
Experiment:
The ligation was performed according to the protocol from week 10 .
V08_22
V08_22_1 Attempt b: Purification of ligation V08_21
Experiment:
The purification was performed following the protocol from week 10 .
Observations & Results:
The corresponding agarose gel showed a band of the expected size.
V08_22_2 Attempt b: Transformation of electrocompetent cells with mutant plasmid mixture
Experiment:
The preparation of electrocompetent cells was carried out according to protocol . The subsequent transformation was performed according to the protocol form week 10 .
V08_23
V08_23_1 Attempt b: Analysis of transformation plates and liquid culture V08_22
Experiment:
Investigation of transformation.
Observations & Results:
Worked.
V08_23_2 Transformation of E. coli BL21 and E. coli MG1655 with mutant library!
Experiment:
Electrocompetent cells of E. coli BL21 and E. coli MG1655 were prepared according to protocol .
V08_24
V08_24_1 Analysis of transformation plates V08_23
Experiment:
Investigation of transformation.
Observations & Results:
Worked. We have now successfully generated a mutant library consisting of 2x105 different mutants. For more information on the method and other results, please visit our "results" page. The members of group #3 now helped the other focus groups with their projects.
V08_24_2 Preparation of glycerol stocks
Experiment:
Glycerol stocks (30 %) of E. coli BL21 and E. coli MG1655 were prepared according to protocol .
