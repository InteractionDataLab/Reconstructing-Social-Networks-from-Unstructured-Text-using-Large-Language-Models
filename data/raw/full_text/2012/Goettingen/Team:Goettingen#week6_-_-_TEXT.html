V06_04
Chemical retransformation of the flhDC-promoter constructs into E. coli (DH10B)
Experiment:
For the chemical retransformation the standard protocol for transformation was followed. The following constructs were transformed into E. coli:
20E - #2
20E - #3
18M - #2
18M - #3
18C - #1
18C - #2
Observations & Results:
The retransformation was successful since all plates showed numeours colonies except the negative control.

V06_05_1 Preparative double digestion of flhDC and plasmids containing further promoters
Experiment:
In order to clone flhDC behind further promoters, the purified PCR product was digested with XbaI and PstI, whereas the BioBrick plasmids were cut with SpeI and PstI. The digestion was performed as described in the protocol l. This time the follwing promoters were used:
J23113 - 20G - x21
J23109  - 2G - x106
J23114 - 20I - x256
J23106 - 18O - x1185
J23104 - 18K - x 1831
V06_05_2  Insertion of flhDC into the BioBrick plamids
Experiment:
The ligation of the digested flhDC with the BioBrick plasmids was conducted as described in the protocol .
V06_06
Chemical transformation of the flhDC-promoter constructs into E. coli (DH10B)
Experiment:
For the chemical transformation the standard protocol was followed.
Observations & Results:
The transformation was successful since all plates showed numeours colonies except the negative control. However, on the plastes with 18K and 18O few red colonies could be observed. These were again rejected.
V06_07
Preparation of over night cultures
Experiment:
Over night cultures were prepapred of three colonies of each constructs in order to isolate the plasmids.
V06_08
V06_08_1 Miniprep of the new flhDC-promoter constructs
Experiment:
Minipreps were conducted with PeqGOLD MiniPrep Kit (Peqlab) according to the user manual.
V06_08_2  Test digestion of the new flhDC-promoter constructs
Experiment:
In order to prove correct insertion of flhDC a test digestion was performed using SpeI and XbaI according to the protocol .
Observations & Results:
For each construct two to three clones hosting the correctly inserted gene in the plasmid could be obtained. Those colonies still containing the rfp gene and were thus rejected.
