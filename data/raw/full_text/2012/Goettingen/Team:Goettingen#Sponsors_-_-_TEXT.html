Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen
The MPI for Biophysical Chemistry supported us in many different ways e.g. in providing us labspace by allowing us to utilize the S1 Demolab. In this case, Dr. Steffen Frey from the Görlich Lab needs to be emphasized because he is responsible for the Demolab and as well the first contact person regarding the lab. Additionally, the employees of the Görlich Lab and the Eichele Lab supported us by cleaning and autoclaving our necessary material.

Dept. of Synthetic Biology, Georg-August-University of Göttingen
The Group of Prof. Neumann provided our team with all their knowledge, help and lab space they could afford. Not all techniques that were needed are realizable in the S1 Demolab of the MPI. Therefore, some team members worked in the laboratory of Prof. Neumann's group. Beside the people assisting us directly (named in "Advisors") with our task, all remaining employees welcomed and helped us out.

Faculty of Biology, Georg-August-University of Göttingen
The faculty of biology, represented by Prof. Dr. Heineke (dean of study affairs) and Dr. Herbst-Gaebel (study advisor) supported our team by paying the registration fee and accrediting this project. Both is very important, because it gives us the opportunity to fully concentrate on the iGEM project during the summer term with less other courses.

Göttingen Genomics Laboratory, Georg-August-University of Göttingen
Göttingen Genomics Laboratory is an internationally renowned centre for the sequencing and annotation of microbial genomes and metagenomes. Its work also covers the processing of sequence data used for functional genome analysis. Methods for determining the size of microbial genomes, for producing plasmid libraries with defined insert sizes and for generating cosmid, fosmid and cDNA libraries are as similarly well established as is high-throughput microbial genome sequencing. The G2L provided our team with free sequencing approaches and helped us with all their knowledge.

Center for Molecular Bioscience, Göttingen (GZMB)
The Göttingen Center for Molecular Biosciences (GZMB) is a joint initiative of more than 30 research groups, affiliated with the Faculty of Biology, the Medical School (University Medicine), Faculty of Chemistry Faculty, the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, and the Faculty of Forest Sciences at the Georg August University Göttingen. All of these research groups work in the field of molecular biology. In 2003, a new laboratory building was finished that houses six different groups of the Medical Faculty and the Biology Faculty. Five of these six groups are novel appointments. Regularly, the GZMB and its members are host for a lot of scientific symposiums and colloquiums. With their know how they helped our team in the organization of the Synthetic Biology Day and the panel discussion .

Deuerlich, Göttingen
Deuerlich was founded in 1807 in Göttingen by Rudolf Deuerlich. For about 100 years the book store was operated by his family. In 1920, the store changed his owner and now the Ruprecht family was its manager. Followed by many years of modernization, enlargement and restructuration, the store was bought by Weiland. Weiland, as well as Deuerlich, is a family-held book store company. Finally, in 2007, the Weiland head company was acquired by the DBH Buchhandelsgesellschaft, which is the biggest book store company in Germany. Deuerlich provided our team with prizes, that were raffled out under the participants of our survey!
