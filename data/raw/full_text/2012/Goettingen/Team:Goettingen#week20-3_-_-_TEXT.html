Inoculation of LB-media for qrtPCR of different promoter constructs
Experiment:
5 mL of LB-media with 50 µg/mL chloramphenicol were inoculated with E. coli strain BL21 haboring the vector pSB1C3 with following combinations of promoters and Tar receptor constructs:
- Tar receptor under the control of constitutive promoter J23100
- Tar receptor under the control of constitutive promoter J23104
- Tar receptor under the control of constitutive promoter J23105
- Tar receptor under the control of constitutive promoter J23106
- Tar receptor under the control of constitutive promoter J23109
- Tar receptor under the control of constitutive promoter J23112
- Tar receptor under the control of constitutive promoter J23113
- Tar receptor under the control of constitutive promoter J23114

Cultures were incubated overnight at 37 °C, shaking.
