S1 Demo Lab
The Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry cooperates closely with the University of Göttingen and the Institute for Medicine. A lot of different courses are hosted cooperatively.
In order to provide lab space for these courses the Demo Lab was built. Here, you can find actual working space and the equipment for small seminars or lectures. Seeing as no laboratory in the buildings of the University of Göttingen had the capacity to provide space for the iGEM Team Göttingen, Prof. Neumann turned to the Max-Planck-Institute whereupon they offered us to use the Demo Lab.
To enable work with genetically modified organisms, the essential point of the iGEM contest, the Demo Lab was upgraded to the S1 security status and furnished with additional equipment, e.g. a microwave, incubators, centrifuges, thermo mixers etc.
The iGEM Team Göttingen is incredibly thankful for the granted lab space and the given support in all respects. Even though it is always very hard work to reach the MPI campus by bike, in retrospective we could not have found a better place to realize our project. For here, we are able to work without disturbing other researchers and truly have to organize the whole lab work flow as well as purchase all the necessary materials by ourselves.
