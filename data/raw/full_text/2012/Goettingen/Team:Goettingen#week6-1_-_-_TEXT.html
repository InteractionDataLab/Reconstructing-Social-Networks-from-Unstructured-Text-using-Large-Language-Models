#1 Selection / Swimming - 6th Week
Back to overview
V06_04
V06_04_1: preparation of swimming cultures and LB-swimming plates to perform swimming assay
Experiment:
LB-Agar plates, composed of concentrations of 0.5% or 0.3% in addition to the standard LB-components were produced. Afterwards, 1 µL of DH10B-strains with P1-18C and P1-18M constructs were dropped onto plates.
V06_05
V06_05_1: Different promotor strengths were tested on different agar compositions.
Experiment:
1 µL, 2 µL, and 5 µL of transformed strains (plasmids used: P1-18C-K3, P1-20E-K3, P1-18M-K2, P1-18M-K1, P1-18C-K2, P1-20E-K2) were tested on two different swimming agars, each. The agar was composed of: 1) 0.3% agar, 0.5% glucose, 1% yeast extract; 2) 0.3% agar, 0.5% glucose, 0,33% beef extract.
Observations & Results:
The best swimming/growing conditions that could be identified were agar 1), no swimming at agar 2) and 5 µL of dropped baceria solution. The plates with 1 µL and 2 µL did not show any swimming/growth.
