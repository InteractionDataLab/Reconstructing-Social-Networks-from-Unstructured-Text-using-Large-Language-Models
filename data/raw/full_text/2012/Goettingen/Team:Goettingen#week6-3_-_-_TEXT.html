V06_04
Preparation of pUC18_TAR_QC
Experiment:
1% agarose gel was performed to analyze DpnI digest. Gel extraction was performed as described before with peqGOLD Gel extraction kit (Peqlab). Samples were stored at -20 °C.
V06_05
Transforamtion of DH10B with pUC18_TAR_QC
Experiment:
Transformation was performed according to protocol .
V06_06
Preparation of Miniprep cultures
Experiment:
Preparation of overnight cultures for Miniprep of pUC18_TAR_QC.
V06_07
V06_07_1 Preparation of chemocompetent cells of Δtar
Experiment:
Chemocompetent cells were prepared as described in this protocol . ON cultures from 06.06. were used.
V06_07_2 Miniprep of pUC18_TAR_QC
Experiment:
Minipreps were done with peqGOLD Miniprep Kit (Peqlab) according to the user manual. A test digestion was performed using XbaI and the expected fragment of 4342 bp was observed on the corresponding gel. Minipreps were stored at -20 °C.
V06_08
V06_08_1 Preparative double digest of pUC18_TAR_QC
Experiment:
Digest was performd with XbaI and PstI (according to BioBrick standard) according to protocol . A gelelectrophoresis of the digest was performed which showed the expected bands at 2662 bp and 1680 bp. The insert TAR_QC (1680 bp) was cut from the gel and a gel extraction was performed as described before. Stored at -20 °C.
V06_08_2 Sequencing of pUC18_TAR_QC
Experiment:
Sequencing reactions were done by Prof. Daniels Laboratory (University of Göttingen), Göttingen Genomics Lab and set up according to their protocol . Primers used: pUC18_M13 for, pUC18_M13 rev, pUC18_TAR_Seqfor01, pUC18_TAR_Seqfor02. Dilutions 100 μM, 10 μM, 5 pmol.
