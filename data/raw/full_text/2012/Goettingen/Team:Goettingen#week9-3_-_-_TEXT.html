V06_25
Ligation of promoterX_TAR_QC constructs into pSB1C3
Experiment:
8 different promoter_TAR_QC constructs (for details see here ) were ligated into the vector pSB1C3 according to protocol . Subsequently E. coliΔtar were transformed with the generated constructs, plated on CM plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight.

V06_28_1 Preparation of pSB1C3_TAR_QC
Experiment:
The vector pSB1C3 was prepped using the peqGOLD Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Peqlab) following the user maual. Elution in 50 µL elution buffer.
V06_28_2 Test digest of pSB1C3_TAR_QC
Experiment:
A test digest of prepped pSB1C3_TAR_QC was performed according to protocol using XbaI and PstI. This should verify that the insertion of promoterX_TAR_QC into pSB1C3 has actually succeeded.
Observations & Results:
The corresponding Agarose gel showed bands at the expected fragment sizes (1721 bp for TAR_QC and 2048 bp for the vector backbone). Plasmids were labeled:
