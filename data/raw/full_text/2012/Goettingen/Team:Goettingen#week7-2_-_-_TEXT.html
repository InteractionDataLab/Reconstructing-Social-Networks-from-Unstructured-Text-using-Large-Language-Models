V06_11
V06_11_1 Miniprep of the new flhDC-promoter constructs
Experiment:
Minipreps were conducted with PeqGOLD MiniPrep Kit (Peqlab) according to the user manual.
V06_11_2 Chemical retransformation of the new flhDC-promoter constructs into E. coli (DH10B)
Experiment:
For the chemical retransformation the standard protocol was followed. The following constructs were transformed into E. coli:
20G - #1
20G - #2
2G - #1
2G - #2
2G - #3
20I - #2
20I - #3
18O - #2
18O - #3
18K - #1
18K - #2
18K - #3
Observations & Results:
The retransformation was successful since all plates showed numeours colonies except the negative control.
V06_12
Preparation of over night cultures
Experiment:
In order to gain further plasmid material over night cultures of one colonie of all eight flhDC-promoter constructs were prepared for subsequent plasmid isolation.
- 20E - #2
- 20G - #1
- 2G - #1
- 20I - #2
- 18M - #2
- 18O - #2
- 18K - #1
- 18C - #2
V06_13
V06_13_1 Miniprep of the new flhDC-promoter constructs
Experiment:
Minipreps were conducted with PeqGOLD MiniPrep Kit (Peqlab) according to the user manual.
V06_13_2 Chemical transformation of pBAD-sfGFP into E. coli (DH10B)
Experiment:
For the chemical transformation the standard protocol was followed.
Observations & Results:
The transformation was successful since all plates showed numeours colonies except the negative control.
V06_14
Preparation of over night cultures
Experiment:
Over night cultures of the pBAD-sfGFP clones were prepared in order to isolate the plasmids.
V06_15
Miniprep of pBAD-sfGFP
Experiment:
Minipreps were conducted with PeqGOLD MiniPrep Kit (Peqlab) according to the user manual.
