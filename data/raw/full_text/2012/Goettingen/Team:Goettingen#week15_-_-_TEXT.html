#2 Speed Improvement - 15th week

V08_06
Preparation of over night cultures
Experiment:
In order to test new agar compositions for the swimming assay over night cultures of E.coli MG1655 and RP437 were prepared.
V08_07
Performance of motility assay
Experiment:
LB medium was inoculated with the over night culture and shaken until an optical density of 0.8 was reached. This time three different compositions were produced:
- M9 agar with tryptone solution soaked Whatman Filter Paper
- M9 agar with methionine solution soaked Whatman Filter Paper
- Agar containing 1% tryptone and 0,5% NaCl with additional tryptone solution soaked Whatman Filter Paper
The cultures were dropped on the agar at a distance of 1 cm to the paper. Also this time each plate was prepared in duplicates.
Observations & Results:
The day after (8th of August) the strongest motility could be observed for MG1655 on M9 agar with tryptone as attractant. However it does not seem to be directed. RP437 did also show motility, but in a more moderate manner. Also here no chemotaxis was noticed.
On the M9 plates with methionine as attractant no motility could be observed at all for either strain.
On the tryptone containing agar plates a similar outcome could be examined. MG1655 swims, but does not feature chemotaxis. RP437 in contrast did neither show any swimming nor chemotaxis.
V08_08
Chemical transformation of tar-18C in E .coli DH10B Δtar
Experiment:
For the chemical transformation the standard protocol was followed. Additionally to tar-18C, RFP-18C was transformed into Δtar to gain a reference strain.
Observations & Results:
The transformation was successful since numerous colonies were obtained except for the negative control.
