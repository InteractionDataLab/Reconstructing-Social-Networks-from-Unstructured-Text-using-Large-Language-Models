#1 Selection / Swimming - 5th Week
Back to overview
V05_31
V05_31_1: Chemotaxis of flhDC-upregulated E.coli on beef-extract plates with different Agar/Trypton concentrations
Experiment: Agar preparation: 0.5% Trypton and 1.0% Trypton are tested with 0.3% and 0.4% agar. Additional the agar contained 1,0% NaCl and 0.3% beef extract
V06_01
V06_01_1: Swimming assay with P1-18C3-DH10B
Experiment: Different cell concentrations were tested on different agar compositions
Observations & Results: Most of the bacteria drops did not move at all after 20.5h of incubation at 30°C.
V06_02
V06_02_1: Swimming plates were exposed to UV light, which may induce random speed-enhancing mutations
Experiment: Different plates were exposed for different time periods (1, 2, 5, and 10 min) to UV light. Afterwards, the plates were incubated at 30°C to identify cells with improved swimming later on.
Observations & Results: No improved or enhanced swimming was detectable. Therefore it can be assumed that no benefitial mutations have occured.
