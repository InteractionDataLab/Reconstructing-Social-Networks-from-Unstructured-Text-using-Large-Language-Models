#1 Selection / Swimming - 9th Week
Back to overview
V06_26
Separation assay
Experiment:
Similar to V06_13, strains with different promotor were mixed 1:1 and dropped onto the plates
V06_27
Whatman paper assay
Experiment:
Cultures of ∆tar with different promotor (empty, 20E, 18C, and 18M) strengths are dropped onto M9 agar plates and Whatman paper is used as attractant (1. Whatman paper incorporated with 0.5% trypton solution; 2. Whatman paper incorporated with 50 mM aspartate solution)
Observations & Results:
Chemotaxis was mainly visible on the plates with trypton-soaked Whatman paper. The strains with 18C, 18m and 20E showed good swimming and some chemotaxis. The strain containing the empty vector showed neither of both. Furthermore, the plates with aspartate soaked Whatman paper showed only swimming which was not directed (= no chemotaxis).
V06_28
∆tar strains with different promotors (see V06_27_1) were tested for swimming on trypton plates (0.5% trypton, 0.3% agar, 0.5% NaCl)
Experiment:
All straines showed swimming. The strain with promotor 18C showed the best swimming abilities.
V07_01
Over night cultures
Experiment:
A lot of strains with a variety of containing plasmids was incolulated for over night cultures, acording to the standard methode.
