#3 Chemoreceptor Library - 14th Week
Back to overview
V07_30
V07_30_1 2nd round: Analysis of the transformation V07_27
Experiment:
The plates and liquid culture were analyzed.
Observations & Results:
Neither the liquid culture nor the plates exhibited bacterial growth.
V07_30_2 2nd round: Saturated mutagenesis PCR, 1000 µL
Experiment:
The PCR was set up again, seeing as we lost our DNA material during the ethanol precipitation the previous week.
V07_31
V07_31_1 2nd round: PCR clean-up
Experiment:
The PCR clean-up was performed according to the established protocol form week 10 .
Observations & Results:
The corresponding agarose gel showed a band of the expected size.
V07_31_2 2nd round: DpnI/BsaI digestion and purification
Experiment:
The digestion was performed with a total volume of 300 µL according to protocol of week 10 . The purification was now again performed using the peqGOLD Cycle-pure Kit (PeqLab). This should stop the loss of DNA material throughout the purification steps!
Observations & Results:
The corresponding agarose gel showed a band of the expected size.
V07_31_3 2nd round: Ligation
Experiment:
The ligation was set up in a 100 µL batch according to protocol . Incubation over night at 16 °C.
V08_01
V08_01_1 2nd round: Ethanol precipitation if ligation V07_31
Experiment:
The ethanol precipitation was performed according to the established protocol form week 10 .
Observations & Results:
The corresponding agarose gel showed a band of the expected size.
V08_01_2 2nd round: Transformation of electrocompetent cells with mutant plasmid mixture
Experiment:
Electrocompetent cells were prepared according to protocol . The transformation was performed according to protocol of week 10 .
V08_02
V08_02_1 2nd round: Analysis of transformation V08_01
Experiment:
Plates and liquid culture were checked for successful transformation.
Observations & Results:
No bacterial growth on neither plates nor in liquid culture. Again, our DNA material was presumably lost during the ethanol precipitation. Confirmation see V08__02_2!
V08_02_2 2nd round: Test digestion of the ethanol precipitation samples
Experiment:
A test digestion with EcoRI and PstI was performed on the samples from V08_01_1.
Observations & Results:
The corresponding agarose gel did not show any bands! There was no DNA material present in the ethanol precipitated samples.
V08_02_3 2nd round: mutagenesis PCR from V07_30 repeated
Experiment:
The PCR was performed according to the established protocol from week 10 .
V08_03
V08_03_1 2st round: PCR clean-up
Experiment:
The clean-up was performed using peqGOLD Gel extraction Kit (PeqLab) following the user manual. 100 µL of elution buffer was used.
Observations & Results:
The corresponding gel showed a band of the expected size.
V08_03_2 2nd round: DpnI/BsaI digestion
Experiment:
The digestion was performed with a total volume of 200 µL according to protocol .
V08_03_3 2nd round: Digestion clean-up
Experiment:
The clean-up was performed using peqGOLD Gel extraction Kit (PeqLab) with an EB volume of 100 µL.
Observations & Results:
The corresponding gel showed a band of the expected size.
V08_05
2nd round: Ligation
Experiment:
The ligation was set up in a 2000 µL batch according to protocol . Incubation over night at 16 °C.
