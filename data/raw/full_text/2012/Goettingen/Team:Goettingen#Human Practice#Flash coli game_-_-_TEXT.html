Flash Coli - the game (beta 1.03)
Welcome to the Flash Coli computer game! Flash Coli swims through your gut and is attacked by deadly phages. Fortunately Flash Coli can defend himself by shooting proteases. Try to kill as many phages as possible.
Information: Viruses that attack bacteria are called phages (or bacteriophages). In this game the phages are of the same size as Flash Coli but in real life phages are much smaller! Flash Coli is like an average Escherichia coli about 2 µm tall (0.002 mm), the phages to the contrary are only 200 nanometer small (0.0002 mm). Because it is so hard to aim at this small targets we made the ingame phages 10 times larger.
