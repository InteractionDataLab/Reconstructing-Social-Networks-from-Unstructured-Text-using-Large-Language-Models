V06_18
Isolation of vector backbone pSB1C3 from BioBrick distribution kit
Experiment:
The vector pSB1C3 is used as the standard vector for BioBricks in this year's iGEM competition. We transformed E. coli DH10B with pSB1C3 according to protocol and streaked these out on Chloramphenicol (CM) plates.
V06_22
V06_22_1 Preparative digest of promoter_TAR_QC constructs and pSB1C3
Experiment:
All 8 promoter constructs + TAR_QC in J61002 were digested with XbaI and PstI and the BioBrick vector pSB1C3 with SpeI and PstI according to protocol.
Observations & Results:
The transformation of DH10B with pSB1C3 (see V06_18) worked well. pSB1C3 contained RFP which is now cut out.
V06_22_2 Preparation of glycerol stocks
Experiment:
Glycerol stocks (30 %) of 2 clones E. coli DH10B with pSB1C3 were prepared and stored at -80 °C.
