V05_02
V05_02: Motility of E. coli on different agar concentrations
Experiment:
Agar-media (1% LB) with different Agar concentrations (0.150% to 0.975%, in 0.075% steps) were used. The Δtar-strain were used.
Observations & Results:
>0.45% agar: no migration is visible; 0.375% agar: ~3 mm corona is visible. Only little movement; 0.3% agar: strong movement. About 7 mm corona is visible; >0.225% agar: bacteria in whole medium. Obviously too little agar concentrations; 0.3% agar: bright  corona (2.5 cm) is visible; 0.45% agar: now a corona is visible. A side colony runs faster than the rest of the corona. Potential speed mutation.

V05_04_1: E. coli movement-dependence of EDTA concentrations
Experiment:
Beef(0.3 %)-Trypton-agar with the concentrations 0.5 % and 1.0 % Trypton were made with and without 10^-6 M EDTA.
Observations & Results:
All colonies show a small halo. Only the experiment without EDTA and 1% Trypton shows a big corona. The EDTA only got a negative influence to the swarming.
V05_04_2: Comparison of movement-speed of Δtar strain and potential speed-mutation (see V05_02)
Experiment:
0.3 % agar LB-medium were made. Original ΔTar strain and possible speed mutant were tested.
Observations & Results:
The original ΔTar strain shows a bigger corona as the potential speed mutant.
