Synthetic Biology and to reduce distrust. So we thought about how we could reach many people and how we could encourage an open discussion
about Synthetic Biology. The first question was of cause: how much does the public know about that topic? That is why we decided to prepare
a survey and hand it out in Göttingen as well as distribute it through the internet.
</P><P>Additionally we decided to organize a “Synthetic Biology information evening” on the 7th of September which should give general
information as well as opposed opinions in order to reduce opposed sentiments and enable a forming of an objective view on that topic.
But for an information evening of cause we need experts on the field of Synthetic Biology willing to present themselves, state their opinion
and participate in a discussion.
</P><P>Thus we started to invite experts with different fields of studies to be able to present a broad diversity of opinions and we are very
glad that three speakers accepted our invitation!

Göttingen. On Friday, the 7th of September they will present their project and debate synthetic biology, bioethics, biotechnology and genetic engineering under the title “Legoland for natural scientists”. In the central lecture hall building of the university, room 103, starting 16 o’ clock you can listen to: Prof. Michael Bölker, Marburg; Dr. Anna Deplazes-Zemp, Zürich; science journalist Sascha Karberg, Berlin and Dr. Günter Strittmatter, Einbeck.</BLOCKQUOTE><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Panel_Discussion_R.C3.A9sum.C3.A9"> Panel Discussion Résumé </SPAN></H2><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">The protocol of the panel discussion. <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2012/f/f7/Protocol_of_Panel_Discussion.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Download it here!</A></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>On 7th of September at 4 pm the lecture hall in the central lecture hall building of the University of Göttingen was filled
with interested visitors. They came to listen to our informative event about Synthetic Biology &quot;Legoland for Scientists&quot;. 
Several weeks before, we were very busy organizing the information event. The first idea was to evaluate the survey.
But to complete the planned event, we decided to invite some experts from different categories like politics, economy,
ethics, journalism and science to discuss the survey results together. To win some experts over was more difficult than
expected. First of all, it was holiday time in Germany and most people we invited had been on vacations. The second point
was that we wanted to invite the experts by our own without any help of our advisors. Because we are actually not well known,
it was difficult to contact them. In the end, we were happy to welcome four experts: Prof. Dr. Michael Bölker (Biologist and
Advisor of the iGEM Team Marburg), Sascha Karberg (Scientific Journalist), Dr. Anna Deplazes-Zemp (Biomedical Ethics) and Dr.
Günter Strittmatter (Representative for economy; Leader of the institute for plant breeding of KWS). 
The event starts with a warm welcome given by Bianca and a short introduction into the iGEM competition, BioBricks and our
project by Anna. This presentation was given in a manner that every citizen could follow. Afterwards Bianca introduced the
experts to the audience. The first talk was given by Prof. Dr. Michael Bölker. He was talking about Synthetic Biology
presenting the founders like Craig Venter and some applications of Synthetic Biology (<A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbEbEu-e3Vc" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbEbEu-e3Vc</A>).
Sascha Karberg as the second speaker of the evening gave a critical talk about Synthetic Biology. He pointed out the possible risks
and also showed some interesting excerpts of articles he was confronted with the topic Synthetic Biology (<A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqjqZPP9_GU" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqjqZPP9_GU</A>).
The last talk was given by Dr. Anna Deplazes-Zemp. She presented the ethic and moral questions scientists have to ask themselves working
with controversial discussed organisms and methods (<A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDBpW0fy13w" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDBpW0fy13w</A>). The audience, as well as we, got a
versatile and interesting view into different aspects of Synthetic Biology. After a short break where the audience and experts could
refresh themselves with homemade cakes and cookies, fruits and coffee, the panel discussion started. Erik was the leader of the discussion
asking Bölker, Karberg, Deplazes-Zemp and Strittmatter questions. The discussion was well coordinated with the results of the survey presented by Niko (<A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tZbxotJ_c8" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tZbxotJ_c8</A>).

</P><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Panel discussion with Dr. Strittmatter, Dr. Deplazes-Zemp, Erik Schliep, Mr. Karberg, and Prof. Bölker (from left to right)</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>Main points of the panel discussion:
</P><UL><LI> The internet is the main source to get information about Synthetic Biology but the media have the power to guide the focus on this topic. Often articles have provocative headlines.
</LI><LI> Synthetic Biology is not yet well known in the society, so people do not want more information but people who are in direct contact with this topic (e.g. farmers) get good support.
</LI><LI> In Germany, there is no need of genetic engineered crops. Companies like KWS accept that mindset.
</LI><LI> Genetic engineered medicals are more accepted than crops because nobody in Europe has to starve but medicals play a more important role.
</LI><LI> A &quot;genetic engineered&quot; label on products should only be put into practice if…
</LI><LI> .... people really want this labeling
</LI><LI> .... products provide real risks otherwise labeling would result in a certificate jungle
</LI><LI> Not only labeling to stigmatize products but rather there should be real risks if a symbol is applied.
</LI></UL><LI> Products also have to be labeled with &quot;pesticides&quot; because they are more dangerous.
</LI><LI> It is not possible for everyone to order toxic genes because such DNA synthesis companies check their clients.
</LI><LI> Microorganisms used in lab have some safety mechanisms which make them unable to survive outside the laboratory.
</LI><LI> An open-minded research-sphere is desired.
</LI><P>The event was rounded up with a dinner in Sambesi restaurant, where we discussed further with the experts.
All in all, we are very satisfied and proud of what we had organized and carried out. By asking some visitors
of the event, we got to know that they liked it very much and they were grateful for the interesting information.
We think our contribution to Human Practice was very successful and a good new feature to inform the public with current
topics of science in a manner, they can follow.
