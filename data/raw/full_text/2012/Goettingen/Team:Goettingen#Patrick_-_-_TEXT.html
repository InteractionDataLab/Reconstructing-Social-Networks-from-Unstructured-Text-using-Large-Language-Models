The Team of IGEM Göttingen
The University of Göttingen iGEM Team consists of twelve undergraduate students and one graduate advisor. Our project was supported and financed by numerous sponsors including KWS Saat Ag and Sartorius AG. We thank all our sponsors for their contributions to our project.

Alicia Illen
I just earned my Bachelor's degree of Biological Sciences at the University of Bonn where I majored in Microbiology and Biotechnology. I am currently attending the Master's program Microbiology and Biochemistry at the University of Göttingen specializing in Molecular Genetics, Microbial Cell Biology and Biochemistry. This will be my first iGEM participation and I am eagerly looking forward to working on our project. It will be an opportunity to work independently and on our own responsibility and to learn a lot about lab work in general. I am looking forward to take part in the international competition to gain valuable experiences that will broaden my horizon.
Anna Maria Köhler
Hello my name is Anna and I'm a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Master in Göttingen as well. When I was in school, we had a practical week with a professor from an university. Since this laboratory experience, I decided to study biology and to become a scientist! I did my bachelor thesis in structural biochemistry in Göttingen, where I became a fan of proteins. Participating the iGEM Team means very much to me, because I'm looking forward to work independently and I like to develop new ideas in a group of students.
Berit Haßing
Hello everybody!
Welcome on our home page!
My name is Berit Haßing and I am a member of the iGEM team of the Georg-August University Göttingen. As most of the other team members I am currently in the second semester of the master study course “microbiology and biochemistry” and I really enjoy studying here in Göttingen! Last year I gained my bachelor degree in the department of microbiology of the University of Osnabrück and currently I am planning to further specialize in the field of microbiology and genetics.  I decided to participate in the iGEM competition because of the possibility plan a complete project and to work independently in a group with further students. Of course I hope to learn a lot and meet interesting new people at the jamborees!
Greetings
Berit
Bianca Genenncher
Hello everybody and welcome to our wiki. My name is Bianca Genenncher and I am a member of the first iGEM team of the University of Göttingen. It is my second year of the Biochemistry and Microbiology Master in Göttingen and I just finished my first lab rotation in the microbe-plant interaction department of Prof. Schirawski. During my Bachelor studies in Göttingen my main focus pointed towards the molecular plant biology examining the plant´s reaction on invading pathogens. Last year, I was studying in Scotland at the University of Aberdeen. I really enjoyed my time abroad working together with students from other countries with interesting cultural backgrounds. This is my first iGEM participation. I am highly motivated to start doing the experiments and gain the first experience designing own experiments. Another reason for me to participate is the internationality of this competition. I am also looking forward to have rewarding discussions about the results or different ways to reach the aim with my kind team members.

Jan Erik Schliep
As well as all of the others, I'm a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Masters program at the University of Göttingen and I'm currently in my first semester. I finished my Bachelor in August 2011 at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in the field of Molecular Biotechnology after six semesters of study. During my time in Munich, I heard of iGEM for the first time. Some of my former fellow students participated in an iGEM Team for the TUM and their stories stunned my very much and I wanted to join a team by myself. I worked for my Bachelor's Thesis at the Chair of Proteomics of Prof. Küster at the Faculty of Life Science at the TUM, were I had a lot to work on my own and plan my work. By doing this, I had a lot of fun and I think to re-experience this during our iGEM project.
Jan Kampf
Hello everybody, my name is Jan Kampf and I am pursuing also the MSc/PhD program in "Microbiology and Biochemistry" at the Georg-August University of Goettingen. I received my Bachelor of Science in the field of Molecular Biology in 2011 at the Faculty of Biology of the University of Goettingen as well. For my bachelor  thesis "Insights into Mammalian SIRT6 Function in Cellular Stress Response" I  worked at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Goettingen. During  my time as a bachelor's student in the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry   I had the opportunity to work in an environment with people from various countries   raised in different and diverse cultures. It was a great time for me and motivated   me to spend a period of time working again on a project, which allows earning   experience in autonomous efforts and planning of our project. So I am really looking   forward to our iGEM project for the opportunity to work independently in a team of   young students as well  as the opportunity to present our work and the results to a   multicultural audience and the exchange of experiences during the time of the iGEM   project of the other teams.
Leonhard Nagel
Hello, my name is Leo and I am also a student of the Microbiology and Biochemistry Masters program at the University of Göttingen.  I chose this Master program because I liked the combination and variety of the special emphasis. In 2011 I finished my Bachelor with a special focus on genomic and applied microbiology at the University of Göttingen. I am very proud to be a part of the first iGEM team of Göttingen. I think the participation in the iGEM competition will improve my lab skills and will prepare me also for my following scientific career. Furthermore, I hope our project will be successful and enables us to take part in the regional and international Jamboree.
Nikolas Rakebrandt
My name is Nikolas Rakebrandt and I am currently in the first semester of the MSc "Microbiology and Biochemistry" program in Göttingen. Before my career as a scientist, I made a little detour and hold  a BSc in Business Administration and Economics from the University of Passau. After this, I acquired   my Biology BSc in Göttingen with a thesis about effector proteins of plant pathogenic fungi. I am   really looking forward to iGEM because it will be "our" project and we will be able to work and plan   on this autonomously. I think this will be very challenging and fun, not to mention that we will probably   learn a great deal!
When I am not busy with PCRs, cloning or studying I am very much into sports like football, surfing or basketball.  Also I like travelling whenever there is time (and money) or just being outside.

Sandra Keiper
As a big fancier of genetics, microbiology and biochemistry, I recently started to study Microbiology and Biochemistry for a Masters degree at the Georg-August University of Göttingen. Last year, I aquired the academic degree of bachelor of science in biology at the Humboldt University of Berlin. During these studies I also specialized on the already mentioned fields. This year is the first I participate in iGEM and I'm really looking forward to work independently on our project and hope learn something and to meet new people.
Simon Uhse
My name is Simon, I am currently studying in the biochemistry and microbiology Master´s programme at the University of Göttingen. Last year, I finished my Bachelor with an emphasis on molecular biology at the University of Göttingen. Next to the university courses I really enjoy to play tablesoccer in my freetime. I am a member of a club which competes with other teams in a german wide national league. This year, I joined the iGEM team to participate in an interesting competition as well as improve my lab skills. I am eager to organize and develop a project together with other students and just like to have a fun time with them. Hopefully, we are able to get to the jamboree in europe and meet lots of other students with worthwhile ideas and projects.
