Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry
The Max Planck Society is an independent, non-profit association whose primary aim is the furtherance of science. In the first place, this is achieved by the maintenance of research institutions in Germany, as well as in other countries.
The eponym of the Max-Planck-Society is Max Planck, the co-inventor of the quantum theory. The association was founded 1948 and possesses nowadays not only a leading position in Germany but acquired a high international reputation.
For instance, the society was classified as the best non-university research institution worldwide in 2006 and although it is a rather new association it can already boast 17 Nobel laureates since its foundation 64 years ago.
The Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen exists since 1971. The basic idea that finally led to its foundation was the desire to examine complex life processes using biological as well as chemical and physical methods.
Here, biologists, chemists, physicians and physicists meet and work hand in hand. However, not only its interdisciplinarity makes this institute so interesting. With around 850 employees from up to 50 nations, the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysical Chemistry is not only one of the biggest of the Max-Planck-Society, but also a very international institution. It brings people of distinct cultures into close contact and pushes intercultural dialogue.
The institute comprises eleven scientific departments and 31 independent research groups, which cooperate with each other as well as with further Max-Planck-Institutes and the University of Göttingen.
As the investigated processes take place at micro- to nanoscopic levels high resolution instruments play an important role. In this research field, ultrahigh resolution fluorescence microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron microscopy are applied on a daily base. Subsequently, the gathered information is used to create computer-simulated models of various proteins.
Nevertheless, the Max-Planck-Institue contributes to teaching junior scientists and students besides their research interests. This is why the Demo Lab has been set up. Here, courses for pupils and students take place additional to internal advanced training courses. Thanks to Professor Neumann’s connections to the Institute, we, the iGEM team Göttingen, were allowed to do our laboratory work in the mentioned Demo Lab. Beyond that, we have received multifarious support from the employees. We are very pleased and honored to be given the chance to work at such an internationally recognized institution.
