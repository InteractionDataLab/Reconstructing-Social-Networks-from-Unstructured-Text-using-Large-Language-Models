Synthetic Biology Day - a review
It is the 25th of august, 9 o’clock in the morning. Nine members of the iGEM team Göttingen gather in the still empty pedestrian area of the city Göttingen. They are bringing tables, boxes full of paper und bags stuffed with sweets. They are prepared for they have a mission!
Together the eleven German iGEM teams want to conduct a nationwide information and participation day for Synthetic Biology. Therefore, each team has planned an individual initiative that aims to present iGEM and their personnel project to the population. So, in various cities in Germany the iGEM-Teams strike out and by this means form the iGEM team Germany for one day.
For this purpose team Göttingen has prepared a poster, which visualizes their projects concept and brochures are supposed to deliver general information about synthetic biology to interested people. But today enlightenment is not the first priority. Today is all about a survey in which passersby are allowed to voice their opinion about Synthetic Biology and related topics.
Soon the first shops will open and the streets fill. Hot dog scent is in the air. The first iGEMers begin to approach the early birds of Göttingen, to proclaim their intention, to hand out flyers. First drops are falling and strengthen slowly but surely to a heavy shower of rain.  People rescue themselves under the awnings of the shops and the information and participation day threatens fail. Nevertheless, the iGEMers are not daunted and soon the crowd beneath the marquee is equipped with clipboards and diligently answering questions while it’s pelting down.
As soon as the first rays of sunshine break through the clouds and only single raindrops fall, the iGEM team swarms out again to collect further opinions. Here you hear a member discussing animatedly with a young couple, there you see a child´s bright face when receiving candy.
Out of nowhere Prof. Dr. Stülke suddenly arrives on the scene. In the past he had already strongly supported the team and now again he is filling in a questionnaire and provides the diligent students with fresh pears and apples. The box with the completed questionnaires fills more and more and all the existing doubts end in smoke for the day seems to become a total success. Six hours and nearly 200 surveys later are the sweets almost gone, the information material visibly less and the iGEMers contented.
The citizens of Göttingen seem to be interested in becoming acquainted with and discussing synthetic biology and maybe some uncertainties could have already been eliminated.
It's not far away, that the surveys results will be evaluated and give rise to further discussions on the “Synthetic Biology information evening” organized by the team.  This is where the topic shall be critically considered and debated. Which conclusions will be drawn will soon become apparent.
A start has been made and so the iGEMers gather before the statue of the “Gänseliesel” to hold on to this moment and the lighthearted mood that in the air is going to remain for some time. In the evening a cozy festive barbeque should take place. Collectively, there will be drinking and eating and everybody will tell stories of the day. And especially one man will remain in everyone’s memory for the “flower for the world peace“ he gave to them will never wither…
