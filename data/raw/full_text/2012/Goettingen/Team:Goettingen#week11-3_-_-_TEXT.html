#3 Chemoreceptor Library - 11th Week
Back to overview
V07_10
V07_10_1 1st round: Digestion DpnI/BsaI and clean-up
Experiment:
The digestion and subsequent clean-up were carried out according to the protocol of week 10 .
Observations & Results:
The corresponding gel showed a band of the expected size.
V07_10_2 1st round: Ligation
Experiment:
The ligation was carried out according to the protocol of week 10 and incubated over night at 16 °C.
V07_11
V07_11_1 1st round: Ethanol precipitation of ligated mutated plasmids
Experiment:
The ethanol precipitation was carried out according to protocol , this time with the right volumes!
Observations & Results:
The corresponding gel showed a band of the expected size.
V07_11_2 1st round: Transforamtion of electrocompetent cells with the mutant plasmid mixture
Experiment:
Electrocompetent cells were prepared according to protocol . We transformed 200 µL of cells with 10 µL of DNA according to the protocol of week 10 . Dilution plates and liquid culture was incubated over night at 37 °C, 180 rpm.
V07_12
V07_12_1 1st round: Analysis of transformation V07_11
Experiment:
Both the liquid culture and the dilution plates were checked for bacterial growth. 5 mL LB liquid cultures + CM were prepared for each clone on the plates for subsequent sequencing of the plasmids. The cultures were incubated over night at 37 °C and 180 rpm.
Observations & Results:
Both the liquid culture and the dilution plates were positive for bacterial growth. Plates showed the following results:
104 10 clones
105 2 clones
106 0 clones
V07_12_2 1st round: Miniprep of liquid culture V07_11
Experiment:
We used 4 x 5 mL liquid culture split to 4 columns for plasmid preparation with the peqGOLD Plasmid Miniprep Kit (PeqLab).
V07_13
V07_13_1 1st round: Miniprep of clones 1-12 V07_12
Experiment:
Plasmids from the 1st mutation round were prepped using the peqGOLD Plasmid Miniprep Kit (PeqLab) following the user manual. DNA concentrations were determined for subsequent sequencing.
Observations & Results:
Concentrations varied between 111 and 165 ng/µL.
V07_13_2 1st round: Sequencing
Experiment:
All 12 clones were sequenced using the primers VR, VF2 and two primers that bind inside tar labeled Seq01_TAR and Seq02_TAR. Here we aimed to examine whether a bias towards certain mutations was introduced.
Additionally we sequenced the generated mutagenesis library with primer VF2 in order to visualize the introduction of multiple mutated bases at the three predetermined sites.
Observations & Results:
We were able to confirm that our mutagenesis technique did not introduce a bias towards certain mutations in the 1st mutation round.
The sequencing chromatogram showed multiple overlaying bases at the predictged sites!
