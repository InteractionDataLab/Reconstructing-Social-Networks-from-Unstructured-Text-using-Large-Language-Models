</LI><LI>Observations and results: 
09_18: More colonies could be counted on the LB plate which contained the cells from capillary with aspartate than on the plates which contained the cells from the capillary with chemotaxis buffer. Because the experiment was only conducted once it was repeated on the 09_18.

09_19: Swimming was observed on every plate. In general the &quot;trafos&quot; showd a better swimming behaviour than the &quot;retrafos&quot;. In most cases even the reference strain swam faster than the &quot;retrafos&quot;. All plates were masured. We suspect that through our selection system we selected strains containing a certain receptor as well as in general fast strains. The next step should be selection of the &quot;retrofos&quot; after three rounds of selection the &quot;retrafos&quot; should be as fast as the &quot;trafos&quot;.
