#1 Selection / Swimming - 2nd Week
Back to overview
V05_11
V05_11_1: Comparison of Yeast- and Beef-agar for Chemotaxis experiments
Experiment:
In this experiment it will be tested, if Yeast-agar (1%) or beef-agar (0.3%) is better for chemotaxis experiments.
Observations & Results:
Booth strains show swarming on Yeast- (1%) and beef (0.3%) agar. Swimming in general very small. Maybe lower nutrition concentrations.
V05_11_2: Finding the right cell-concentrations for chemotaxis experiments
Experiment:
We will test the cell concentrations between 10^6 and 10^9 cells/ml. We drop 10 µL on the agar plate.
Observations & Results:
All cell-concentrations between 10^5 and 10^9 showed good swarming. All tested cell-concentrations are usable.
V05_11_3: Finding the right volumina for chemotaxis experiments
Experiment:
Due to the problems with blured colonies we test different volumina for the colony-drop. Here are tested 1; 5 and 10 µL.
Observations & Results:
The volumina 5 and 10 µL show swarming. The volume of 1 µL does not show swarming. 5 µL will be used for the further experiments
