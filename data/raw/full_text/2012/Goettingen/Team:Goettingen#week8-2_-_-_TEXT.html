V06_18
Chemical transformation of the BioBrick plasmid pSB1C3 into E. coli (DH10B)
Experiment:
In order to gain further plasmid material of the new vector, pSB1C3 was transformed into E. coli (DH10B) as described in the protocol .
Observations & Results:
The transformation was not successful. No colonies could be observed at the plates. Since this vector has a chloramphenicol resistance instead of ampicillin as the usually used pUC18 we suggest that the antibiotic concentration in the agar was simply to high.
V06_19
V06_19_1 Repetition of the chemical transformation of the BioBrick plasmid pSB1C3 into E. coli (DH10B)
Experiment:
pSB1C3 was transformed into E. coli (DH10B) as described in the protocol .
Observations & Results:
The transformation was successful.Due to the possession of a gene encoding for RFP the developed colonies featured a red color. On the negative control no colonies were observed.
V06_19_2 Repetition of the chemical transformation of the araC-promoter into E. coli (DH10B)
Experiment:
Since the last time the fact that the araC-promoter I0500 (14N) is inducible by ITPG was not considered, this time the substance was added to the LB-Medium (end concentration 100 µM). This is the only derogation from the standard transformation protocol .
Observations & Results:
The transformation was again not successful. Only the positive control showed any growth.
V06_20
Preparation of over night cultures
Experiment:
Over night cultures were prepared for group 1 and group 3:
20E-flhDC
18M-flhDC
18C-flhDC
20E-tar
18M-tar
19C-tar
