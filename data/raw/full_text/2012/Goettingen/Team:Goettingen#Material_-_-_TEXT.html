Non-mutated strains
These strains may not contain any plasmids or resistances, because they should be used for transformation or other experiments.

Storage
Storage of E. coli strains - How to keep E. coli strains.
Glycerol Stock
The glycerol stock is prepared as follow:
900 µL over night culture in LB-liquid medium
900 µL 50 % sterile glycerol
Glycerol is extremely viscous. Hence, use cut off tips to pipette. Glycerol stocks were vortexed to ensure uniformly mixture and shock frozen in N2 or dry ice. Then, cultures were stored at -80 °C. Do NOT forget to fill in the according GMO S1 construction sheet!
LB-agar
LB-agar plates were prepared as follow:
1% agar (w/v) was added to 1 L LB-broth
LB-agar was autoclaved
LB-agar was poured in plates
The E. coli strains were plated out and stored at 4°C. The plates were renewed every two weeks.
