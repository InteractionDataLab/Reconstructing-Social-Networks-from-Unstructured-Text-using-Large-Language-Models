</LI><LI>√Best Experimental Measurement
</LI><LI>Best Model
</LI></UL><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Please_explain_briefly_why_you_should_receive_any_of_these_special_prizes:">Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:</SPAN></H3><P><B>Best Human Practice Advance:</B></P><P>We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons: 
</P><OL><LI> We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh. 
</LI><LI> We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output. 
</LI><LI> *Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 (<A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections</A>) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
</LI></OL><P><B>Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:</B></P><P>It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
</P><OL><LI> We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
</LI><LI> Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement. 
</LI><LI> Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample. 
</LI><LI> Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
</LI></OL><P>Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

</P><UL><LI><B>Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K911001" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K911001</A></B>As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
</LI><LI><B>Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K911009" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K911009</A></B>Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
</LI><LI><B>Fast Germination (B. subtilis) <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K911008" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K911008</A></B>This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

</LI><LI> Good cells should yield around 100 - 400 colonies
</LI><LI> Transformation efficiency is (dilution factor=15) x colony count x 10<SUP>5</SUP>/µgDNA
</LI><LI>We expect that the transformation efficiency should be between 5x10<SUP>8</SUP> and 5x10<SUP>9</SUP> cfu/µgDNA
