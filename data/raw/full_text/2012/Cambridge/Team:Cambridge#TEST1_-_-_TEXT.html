THE DRIVING FORCE
Our goal is to standardise the output of biosensors, and to develop a cheap, user-friendly kit to be used in the field

Parts for a Reliable and Field Ready Biosensing Platform
OVERVIEW
There are many biosensors available but there is no standard way to deploy them. Many are also non-quantitative and unpredictable. We have been working on a ratiometric luciferase output which can be read by an Arduino device. This output could be used with theoretically any biosensor. We investigated the potential of riboswitches as future biosensors. We use a B.subtilis chassis as these form low maintenance spores for easy, long-term storage.

RiboSense
A NOVEL FLUORIDE SENSOR BASED ON A RIBOSWITCH CONSTRUCT
Riboswitches may well be the biosensor of the future though they are currently under-represented in the registry.
