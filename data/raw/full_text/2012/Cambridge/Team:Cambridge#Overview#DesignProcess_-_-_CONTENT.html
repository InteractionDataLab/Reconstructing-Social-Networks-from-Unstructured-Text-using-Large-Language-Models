</P><OL><LI> We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh. 
</LI><LI> We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output. 
</LI><LI> *Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 (<A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections</A>) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
</LI></OL><P><B>Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:</B></P><P>It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
</P><OL><LI> We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
</LI><LI> Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement. 
</LI><LI> Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample. 
</LI><LI> Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
</LI></OL><P>Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

</P><UL><LI><B>Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K911001" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K911001</A></B>As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
</LI><LI><B>Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K911009" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K911009</A></B>Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
</LI><LI><B>Fast Germination (B. subtilis) <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K911008" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K911008</A></B>This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

This page contains a more detailed account of our project throughout the summer.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Aim">Aim</SPAN></H2><P>Every good design process must have a clear aim. Ours was to take a step towards realising the full potential of a group of well characterised parts, the biosensors available within the registry, by developing a prototype kit which could be used effectively and practically in real-world applications. In  other words, we aimed to engineer an easy to use product, centred around biobricks, and aimed at the end user. Our team has realised this potential and have developed a kit which has real world uses now, as well as potential applications in the future.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Market_Research">Market Research</SPAN></H2><P>Having decided that the primary aim of our project was the design of a practical useful product, the first thing we needed was to find its potential use as well as a possible market. The ideal market would fulfill at least three requirements: 
</P><UL><LI>Face a real problem which could be solved by our product. 
</LI><LI>Have the financial capacity to obtain/create our product. 
</LI><LI>Be currently in the state where access to similar equipment is limited, and therefore the impact of our solution would be maximised
</LI></UL><P>We aimed to tackle issues concerning the welfare and standard of living of people, in particular those who might lack the resources to tackle them themselves. 
</P><P>To help inform the overall shape of our project, as well as the specifics of our design, we talked to <U><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/Interview" style="color:#000066">Konrad Seigfried</A></U>, a scientist who has already had the chance to test a bioreporter construct in the field.
</P><P>More details about our market research can be found on our 
<A href="/Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/MarketResearch" title="Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/MarketResearch">human practices page.</A></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Objectives">Objectives</SPAN></H2><P>As stated in our project aims, and justified by the market reasearch above, we wanted to develop a standard for biosensors that is reliable, affordable, portable, open-source, accessible and relevant. These different targets required further condensation before a formal design process can begin. The formal design goals for our project were, therefore, the development of:
</P><UL><LI>an output that is reliable, reproducible, and quantitative.
</LI></UL><UL><LI>a robust, standard platform for biosensing inputs.
</LI></UL><UL><LI>a system for the storage and distribution of biosensors for straightforward use in multiple applications.
</LI></UL><UL><LI>a system that is rooted in real world applications that can bring about a positive change in the world
</LI></UL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Design_considerations">Design considerations</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Inputs">Inputs</SPAN></H3><P>It's common sense that without a reliable input system, output systems, however robust, cannot be trusted to give meaningful results. It is therefore important that the response to a given input from a biosensor is well characterised (with response curves) under different conditions. However, to truly revolutionise biosensing we would also require a standard platform which could sense a multitude of analytes. This would allow for better characterisation and all additional information about a sensor's function under different conditions to be acquired with one fewer parameter which would need to be changed.  We would also like the response curves to be relatively linear across a wide range such that different toxicity thresholds are detectable using the same system. Ideally, we would also like a system that could be designed &quot;from scratch&quot; in the future such that there would be no need for an existing response mechanism in an organism to be found before implementation as a biosensor could take place. This goal is a very long way off, but we would like to consider platforms with the potential for it. The input must therefore have the following attributes:
</P><UL><LI>A decoupling between the sensing mechanism and its interface with the output system.
</LI><LI>Highly specific analyte discrimination.
</LI><LI>An output response which is highly proportional to the concentration of analyte present.
</LI><LI>The potential for rational redesign, possibly through the use of software tools.
</LI></UL><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Processing">Processing</SPAN></H3><P>All biosensors currently in the registry only use a single output to relay information about the concentration of an analyte. Because there is great potential for differences in culture homogeneity, and because the productivity of cultures is proportional to their cell density, this often leads to poorly reproducible and unreliable results. We therefore desire some processing to be performed (without specifying where in the whole system, yet) which factors in these variables and allows for a much more accurate readout. With accuracy also comes the ability to provide more quantified readouts, assuming the system is capable of the linear response required for such readings. We also want to be able to tune the linear response range based on the end users' desired implementation, in order to further improve usefulness. The processing system must therefore have the following attributes:
</P><UL><LI>The ability to compensate for culture variability between assays
</LI><LI>The ability to make calculations over a wide range of concentrations with similar, high levels of precision across this range.
</LI></UL><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Outputs">Outputs</SPAN></H3><P>In order for a project that fits our goals to be commercially successful, it is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible output exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the processed input. Outputs fitting this description are commonplace in nearly all other scientific fields where the ability to collect and process data has not only eased interpretation of experiments but also allowed a much faster development of understanding, and ultimately technology, in those fields. In biology however, due to the complexity and inherent variability of the systems under scrutiny, it has been difficult to design such outputs. Additionally, the outputs which exist are either crude, or expensive to produce or interpret. We therefore desire an output with the following characteristics:
</P><UL><LI>Provides reproducible, quantitative data under many environmental conditions with small error margins. 
</LI><LI>Displays data to a user in an intuitive manner that is easy to interpret.
</LI><LI>Be flexible enough to support use in multiple environments
</LI><LI>Does not require specific environmental domains to produce an undistorted post-processing signal.
</LI><LI>Easy to interface with data processing tools
</LI><LI>Capable of supporting multiple readouts from different assays.
</LI><LI>Cheap
</LI></UL><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Sporage_.26_Distribution">Sporage &amp; Distribution</SPAN></H3><P>Design considerations must be in place such that our biosensing platform can be distributed and stored easily and cheaply, whether it be for laboratory testing purposes or field applications in places lacking appropriate facilities (for example, areas which cannot keep cultures frozen, or even provide electrical power for a sensor). This relates particularly well to our human practices where we learnt that a major problem to tackle in developing countries is a lack of the conventional biolab infrastructure which most, current technologies rely on. 
</P><P>The design criteria for this aspect of the product are thus as follows:
</P><UL><LI>Deliverable worldwide 
</LI><LI>Can be stored long term without appreciable loss of quality
</LI><LI>Both of the above without requirement for high powered or high tech infrastructure
