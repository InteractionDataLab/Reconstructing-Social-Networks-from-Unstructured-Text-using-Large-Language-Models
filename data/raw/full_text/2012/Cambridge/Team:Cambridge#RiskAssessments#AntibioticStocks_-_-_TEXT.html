Risks
Antibiotics - Good laboratory practice should always be observed but this is exceptionally important in the case of antibiotics, which should be treated as a hazardous chemical. Handle with care and never touch the face before washing hands having handled them. This is especially important if any member of the team has an allergy to the antibiotics used, most common are allergies to ampicillin (as a penicillin derivative) and kanamycin.
