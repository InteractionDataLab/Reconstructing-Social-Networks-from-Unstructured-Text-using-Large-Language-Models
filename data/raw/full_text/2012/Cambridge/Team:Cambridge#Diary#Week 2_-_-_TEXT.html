Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.
One minute tour! :)

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts, please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
Best new BioBrick part (natural)
BBa_K911003
Best new BioBrick part (engineered)
BBa_K911004
Best improved part(s): None
List any other parts you would like the judges to examine: BBa_K911001 , BBa_K911009 , BBa_K911008
Please explain briefly why the judges should examine these other parts:
Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

The Final Month
Monday
We did the final jobs with our sample colonies today, subjecting them to a restriction digest after extracting their DNA with a miniprep kit . This allowed us to check that the GFP gene had been integrated in the correct way. To aid in this, we were introduced to the plasmid analysis tool ApE, which helped us to choose which restriction enzymes could be used diagnostically. Another crucial ability for the successful integration of artificial plasmids into the bacteria we will be using.
The restriction fragments were then characterized with DNA gel electrophoresis.
In between these steps, we continued our brainstorming sessions. We are aiming to have a basic project description complete by Wednesday, so we are really trying to pull together lots of different ideas to create a cohesive project with a well defined end goal. Input from our Human Practices specialist (Charlie) helps with this.
Tuesday
More brainstorming today. Although the ideas that were pitched in the morning were not particularly promising, we finally hit on a good idea just after coffee. It has the potential to integrate many of the ideas that we already had into a single project, and everyone seems keen to get started on it. A description can be found here . We still need to thrash out the details of the project, but as a general goal it looks highly promising.
On top of this, we started the wiki properly. Paul, Andreas and Emmy are looking into the ways we can make it look flash with html, css and javascript.
Wednesday
Today we had a presentation from one of the guys at Microsoft Research, who demonstrated their (very useful) visual GEC tool for constructing and modeling genetic circuits. We had a go at designing a few different systems, learning the syntax and structure of the software. Of particular note was the XOR gate we constructed, which despite being a fairly complex device could quickly and realistically be constructed and modeled without having to spend days building genetic constructs. This could come in very handy, given our ambitions to standardize these many different biosensors - we really want a high throughput system for constructing them, something which is only really feasible if we have a good idea that our constructs will eventually work.
Later there was a workshop from one of the PhD students in Jim H's lab. He discussed the possibility of using computer programs to model bacterial populations. For example, he demonstrated a program in python that was capable of making simulated bacterial colonies with many of the same emergent properties as those seen in real bacteria.
The day was capped off with, what else, brainstorming. Aptamers seem to be beginning to gain some interest.
Thursday
Our focus today was on the electronic side of the project. Jim H. talked to us about the Arduino open source integrated chip, and what things it could be used for. In the afternoon we were set loose with several Arduino kits, learning how to use the programming environment.
Unfortunately, a single afternoon was not enough time to recapitulate the successes of the Tyrell corporation, but we were still able to come up with a few cool devices. Given that our biosensor idea would ideally be both open source and cheap, using design principles similar to the Arduino could be a lucrative avenue. Additionally, the use of open source electronics such as the Arduino or the Raspberry Pi could directly make our product cheaper and more easily accessible for modification and improvement.
Friday
The last of the seminars today. This one was about the genetic systems that we will be hijacking with our project (in particular fleshing out the central dogma). A big emphasis on the challenges faced by synthetic biology due to the vast complexity of the chemical systems we are trying to insert new constructs into. However, this just goes further to demonstrate the potential value of our project - managing to put any biosensor into a system and be confident that the genetic system will not simply break could have an incredible impact upon synthetic biology.
At two o'clock, everyone pitched their own ideas for potential modules. Aptamers, yeast GPCRs and the different techniques for tuning the response curves were presented, along with potential circuits for the instrumentation portion of the project. The ensuing discussion took... some time, but at the end we had a general idea of what to do in the ensuing weeks, on both the biological and technological fronts.
We still lack any real direction on finding some sort of novel biological system to apply however. Something for us to think about over the weekend.
