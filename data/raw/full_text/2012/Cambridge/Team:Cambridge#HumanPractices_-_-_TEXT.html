Human Practices
N.B. This page is a work in progress and will be added to and improved over the course of our project.

Started our human practices in earnest today, our preliminary research into possible applications for our project lead us to look into heavy metal testing in water supplies. Groundwater contamination is a massive problem worldwide and can have a variety of causes from industrial waste to natural disasters. In this section of the wiki we will consider the current causes of groundwater contamination, the consequences of contamination on the communities it affects and how synthetic biology could be used to assist with and improve current testing procedures.

Dr Vijayraghavan of the Indian Institute of Science Bangalore visited the plant sciences department today. The iGEM team got to meet her and talk about her current work, synthetic biology and iGEM. In addition to being very interesting, she provided some very useful information on the importance of codon optimisation in our project when attempting to transfer E.coli based biobricks into B.subtilis. Many thanks to Dr Vijayraghavan for taking time out of her day to talk to us.
