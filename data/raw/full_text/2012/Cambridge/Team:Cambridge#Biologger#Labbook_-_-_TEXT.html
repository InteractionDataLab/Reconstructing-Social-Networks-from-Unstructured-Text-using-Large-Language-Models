Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.
One minute tour! :)

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts, please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
Best new BioBrick part (natural)
BBa_K911003
Best new BioBrick part (engineered)
BBa_K911004
Best improved part(s): None
List any other parts you would like the judges to examine: BBa_K911001 , BBa_K911009 , BBa_K911008
Please explain briefly why the judges should examine these other parts:
Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

Arduino circuitry
Real-Time image captured by our freshly made primitive software, monitoring a light sensor on an arduino board. C++ was used to communicate with the Arduino and Python was used for data logging.

Testing of the spectral properties of filters
Blue , Green and Red filters were tested in different wavelengths (400 nm - 600 nm) in a spectrophotometer.
Excellent absorbance/emmitance results given by the blue and red filters near 580nm and 490nm respectively. 580nm is the wavelength where intensity of light is to be measured to identify the presence of mOrange. 490nm is the wavelength where maximum light intensity is expected with or without the presence of mOrange.

Ratiometrica-Lux: Transformation of e.coli with lux genes from 2010
Arabinose induction: Using the same 3mM arabinose prepared earlier in the week, the E. coli were spun down and the arabinose was added. After 5 hours, light is observed.
Testing the Arduino kit: the testing took place in the dark room, and the cell culture (in 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes) was held close to the photosensor and then taken away repeatedly. The data recorded was plotted with Matlab, as shown:
Light level against time
It should be noted that the background light levels were falling linearly, possibly due to negative feedback on the photosensor, but there is a consistent 5-6% increase of the original base reading upon placing the cells close the the photosensor.
Week 5
Thursday (26/07/12)
Instrumentation: Hardware implementation
Our device, reaching perfection!
Our device is close to being implemented. The filtered photoresistors are placed now in the right position, the motory circuit is also functioning, the main chassis of the device is constructed and painted. However, the mirrors which will be used to surround the cuvettes are still missing and so is the mechanical coupler designed by us and being constructed at the Instrument shop of the Engineering Department. The device is also powered by a 9V battery, without the need to be connected to the computer.
Week 14
Monday (24/09/12)
Instrumentation
The sensitivity of the sensor concerning light intensities was tested using a dilution series of luciferase-producing bacteria. 20ml Cultures were grown overnight from single colonies. The cultures were induced with 40ul of 1.5M arabinose (for a final concentration of 3mM). Cultures were left for 2 1/2 hours for full induction. Subsequently, a culture was pelleted and resuspended in 4ml LB. Doubling dilutions, of volume 2ml, were made from this concentrate, down to 1/8th concentration. 1ml of each 2ml dilution was analysed in each cuvette, which was placed in the cuvette holder we made ourselves.
Raw sensor values(V) vs Concentration of bioluminescent E.coli- Concentrations on the x-axis are relative therefore an OD 600 value was also taken
Normalised sensor data using a dilution series of bioluminescent E.coli- Concentrations on the x-axis are relative therefore an OD 600 value was also taken
Normalised percentage of blue frequencies using the same dilution series of E.coli
Dilution series of E.coli from most concentrated to least
Tuesday (25/09/12)
Instrumentation
The sensitivity of the sensor concerning different frequencies (colours) of light was tested as well. As can be seen below, measurements taken from orange and blue light yield values respectively above and below those from white light (our reference point). The data was taken using a constant intensity of light for each case (V.High and V.Low brightness). This was done with the aid of an Android phone and a specialised software application, called Color Flashlight, downloaded from the official Market.
Sensor data for different colours at different intensities
