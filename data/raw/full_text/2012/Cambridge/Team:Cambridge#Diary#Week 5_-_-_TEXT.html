Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.
One minute tour! :)

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts, please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
Best new BioBrick part (natural)
BBa_K911003
Best new BioBrick part (engineered)
BBa_K911004
Best improved part(s): None
List any other parts you would like the judges to examine: BBa_K911001 , BBa_K911009 , BBa_K911008
Please explain briefly why the judges should examine these other parts:
Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

The Final Month
Monday
Still no luck on the primers front. Now it looks like we might have to wait a couple of days before they can even be sure we're not bioterrorists. Unfortunately that puts quite a crimp in our experimental plans, since every experiment for the next few weeks requires PCR and, therefore, primers. We will just have to find something else to do in the mean time.
We can still design the things though, so that's what we did. After last weeks debarcle, we're designing them in groups of two to prevent mishaps. Not hugely efficient, but if it stops us from having to waste three days on useless PCR, it's well worth doing.
The template for the wiki was finalized and put up, after considerable pain on Emmy's part. Now every page looks as shiney as our home page.
And we finally have a name- B. SUBTILIGHTS!
Tuesday
It was a beautiful day in Cambridge today (and indeed across the whole United Kingdom, thanks to the Jet Stream slumping Northwards), so we took our work outside. This may have affected our productivity a little, but I think that given our present capabilities, a bit of a break may be a good thing.
Alas, another day of wiki and administration. Potential sponsors were contacted, pages were updated, pictures were drawn, and we did everything we could that wasn't actual biology. This primer dearth is really limiting our ability to do anything useful, extremely frustrating...
We did, however, manage to order some primers, so those should arrive in around two days (assuming GCHQ don't apprehend the package).
Oh, and more work on the Arduino. Apparently we're going to try and make it work with Android.
Wednesday
No primers, no experiments, no life...
Thursday
The hardware implementation has progressed significantly this morning. Andreas has put most of parts together as well as paying some attention to the aesthetics of it. Photos can be seen in Lab book. We're currently just waiting for a  mechanical shaft coupler from the Engineering Department (our own design, of course). With the coupler our device will be driven automatically by a motor connected to our Arduino. The software needs to be completed as well. There is the thought of using the Amarino application that is open-source together with a bluetooth adaptor so that the measurements of our device are received wirelessly at an Android phone. It's cool, isn't it?
Primers also finally arrived, and we got straight down to business, vowing to have all the PCR reactions we had designed finished by the end of the day. Curiously, adding master mix to registry parts makes them turn purple, making the somewhat alchemical nature of the process even more arcane. This also gave us the opportunity to use our extremely elegant PCR machine, which as can be seen in the gallery is quite the Delorean of the PCR world.
Friday
After the 32 PCR reactions from yesterday, the 5 gels that had to be run to separate the products seemed like easy work. Looks like we got some reasonable results; certainly the Mg2+ riboswitch products that we had hoped to make last week are pretty much working. Something like 70 - 80% of our products seem to have been produced, most of the failures being the huge vector fragments. We will try to rerun those next week.
Those gels that were sucessful were cut up and purified. We should be able to begin some Gibson reactions next week.
We also got alot of parts ordered from the registry. Apparently the ones we want don't come with the distribution kit, something that we might want to raise in some way with the iGEM organizers.
Oh, and the London Olympics had its opening ceremony today. Sadly, no direct reference to the Plant Sciences Department of Cambridge by Mr. Boyle. Despite all the people in the team having as much to do with the success of the games as, say, our PCR machine, we can still cry 'Go team GB! And associated territories (cf. Cyprus, Hong Kong)!'
