Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts, please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
Best new BioBrick part (natural)
BBa_K911003
Best new BioBrick part (engineered)
BBa_K911004
Best improved part(s): None
List any other parts you would like the judges to examine: BBa_K911001 , BBa_K911009 , BBa_K911008
Please explain briefly why the judges should examine these other parts:
Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

Biologger Results
Having our instrumentation completed, as can be seen in our Instrumentation (Biologger) page, the sensitivity of the sensor placed in the right position was tested using a dilution series of luciferase-producing E.coli. 20ml Cultures were grown overnight from single colonies. The cultures were induced with 40ul of 1.5M arabinose (for a final concentration of 3mM). Cultures were left for 2 1/2 hours for full induction. Subsequently, a culture was pelleted and resuspended in 4ml LB. Doubling dilutions, of volume 2ml, were made from this concentrate, down to 1/8th concentration. 1ml of each 2ml dilution was analysed in each cuvette, which was placed in the cuvette holder we made ourselves. The result was very good. An almost linear relationship was obtained when data were normalised with the sensor value taken in the dark room (the latter set at zero) without using the cuvette holder (1-(sensor value/sensor value in absolute dark)), presenting the sensitivity of the sensor to different intensities of light. This behaviour was expected due to the changing offset affecting the luciferase spectrum curve at different light intensities. The offset, using our data, was calculated to be about 0.2V for each dilution. A second graph is shown which takes into account this offset (and removes it), thus showing the presence of blue frequencies. The result was as expected, as the presence of blue frequencies throughout the dilution series is not only detected, but also found to be approximately constant. The raw data of this investigation can be found in the Lab book.
Normalised sensor data using a dilution series of bioluminescent E.coli- Concentrations on the x-axis are relative therefore an OD 600 value was also taken
Normalised percentage of blue frequencies using the same dilution series of E.coli
Dilution series of E.coli starting from the most concentrated on the left (number 1) to the least concentrated on the right (number 4). Cuvette number 5 is our control, as it contains only LB
Once the sensor was tested for sensitivity, we tested that our circuitry correctly identified different frequencies (colours) of light. As can be seen below, measurements taken from orange and blue light yield values respectively above and below those from white light (our reference point). The data was taken using constant intensity of light for each case (V.High and V.Low brightness, as specified in the application). This was done with the aid of an Android phone and a specialised software application, called Color Flashlight, downloaded from the official Market.
As expected from the potential-divider design of our circuitry, orange and red frequencies caused the resistance of the LDR with the orange filter to decrease, leading to a higher voltage across the LDR with the blue filter. The opposite effect was observed with blue light. The reason that the white reference point is a bit lower than 2.5V (the expected value for a non-biased circuitry with a 5V source), is because we use resistors of total net resistance 1.67 kΩ before the blue LDR. This was done to bias the circuitry towards blue (i.e. decreasing the starting value, thus the sensor identifies always a bit more blue - this can be shown in previous graphs as well) and thus cause orange light to have a larger impact when present. This was used in an attempt to compensate for the fact that the peak at 560nm (Orange) in MOrange/luciferase fusion spectrum is lower than the one at 490 nm (Blue). Even though we did not manage to test the latter with transformed bacteria, the data collected in all the previous experiments makes us confident that the instrumentation is at least adequately functional.
Sensor data for different colours at different intensities
As the major part of the instrumentation, the bio-electronic interface, had been made and tested, now we turned to testing the other parts of our deveoped kit. This included the mechanical chassis of the prototype, the electronic/mechatronic (sensory and motory) components, and of course the software. The overview of the finished hardware/software can be seen in our Intstrumentation (Biologger) page . Below, the videos showing our instrumentation in action can be seen.
