This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results.

</P><OL><LI> We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh. 
</LI><LI> We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output. 
</LI><LI> *Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 (<A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections</A>) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
</LI></OL><P><B>Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:</B></P><P>It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
</P><OL><LI> We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
</LI><LI> Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement. 
</LI><LI> Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample. 
</LI><LI> Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
</LI></OL><P>Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

</P><UL><LI><B>Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K911001" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K911001</A></B>As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
</LI><LI><B>Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K911009" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K911009</A></B>Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
</LI><LI><B>Fast Germination (B. subtilis) <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K911008" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K911008</A></B>This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Sporage_and_Distribution">Sporage and Distribution</SPAN></H3><P>The fast promoter swap over strains we used in sporage and distribution were developed based on work by Peter Setlow from the Setlow lab at the University of Connecticut (see references in the project section). Furthermore Barbara and Peter Setlow sent us the two E. coli plasmids used for transformation of B. Subtilis as well as the finalised spores we used in testing the construct. They also provided us with information on sporulation and germination protocols and help with designing primers for biobricking the part.
</P><P>Paul Mallaband and Stuart Bell from the team made up sporulation and germination medium and carried out imaging of the spores. They also carried out all relevant pcr, gibson and restriction ligation reactions to make a biobrick of the part.
</P><P>Paul Grant from the Haseloff lab was instrumental in helping with imaging spores and gave advice on staining, slide preparation and microscopy.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Instrumentation">Instrumentation</SPAN></H3><P>Andreas Petrides from the team led the development of the instrumentation kit along with Paul Mallaband. Electronics and Arduino code was tackled by Andreas, python code by Paul whilst both took part in the mechanical design and sourcing of materials. The testing of the instrumentation was done by Andreas with the aid of Thomas Whittaker who prepared the biological samples.
</P><P>The python code was based on that submitted at <A href="http://www.blendedtechnologies.com/realtime-plot-of-arduino-serial-data-using-python/231" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.blendedtechnologies.com/realtime-plot-of-arduino-serial-data-using-python/231</A>. All arduino code was developed by Andreas and Paul. The android application was implemented by Andreas, based on <A href="http://www.amarino-toolkit.net/index.php/home.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><U><SPAN style="color:#000066">Amarino</SPAN></U></A>
projects' open-source code (General Public License). 
</P><P>Mr. Tim Love from the engineering department gave advice on software design and the Engineering department helped with supplying some of the materials required. The actual assembly of the kit was done entirely by Andreas and Paul.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Ribosense">Ribosense</SPAN></H3><P>The fluoride riboswitch, with β-galactosidase reporter, was generously supplied, both in plasmid form, and as transformed cells, by the Breaker laboratory (See references in the project page as well as the special thanks page) at the University of Yale.
</P><P>The plasmid supplied was then transformed into 168 strain <I>B. subtilis</I>, and Top10 <I>E. coli</I>, by Jolyon Martin from the team. He also carried out the β-galactosidase and Miller Assays.
</P><P>The magnesium riboswitch was amplified up, using primers of our own design, from a prepared <I>B. subtilis</I> genome sample. This sample was provided by PJ Steiner of the Haseloff lab. Oliver Meacock, from the team, then pieced this amplified DNA into pJS130, a shuttle vector also provided by PJ Steiner. Oliver Meacock also carried out the characterisation assay for the magnesium riboswitch.
</P><P>All relevant primers for each riboswitch were designed by Jolyon Martin and Oliver Meacock in parallel. All PCR reactions, restriction digests, and other experiments using these parts were carried our by the pair.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Ratiometrica">Ratiometrica</SPAN></H3><P>James Brown from the Haseloff Lab, Cambridge has offered us invaluable advice in collecting and analysing data from our ratiometric fluorescent construct.
</P><P>PJ Steiner from the Haseloff Lab has provided the original E. coli and B. subtilis shuttle vector pJS130 on which we worked.
</P><P>Paul Mallaband, Emmy Tsang and Thomas Whittaker from the team designed and assembled the final ratiometric fluorescent construct using PCR and Gibson assembly. The component biobricks (other than the backbone) came from the Registry's Spring Distribution Kit. We designed the original primers for Gibson and ligation, optimised the PCR, gel and PCR extraction, and Gibson assembly protocols, and tested the construct.
</P><P>Fernan Federici from the Haseloff Lab provided the original mOrange DNA template, while the fischeri LuxBrick (K325909) is from the Parts Registry. Tom and Emmy from the team have assembled the construct using Gibson assembly and PCR.
