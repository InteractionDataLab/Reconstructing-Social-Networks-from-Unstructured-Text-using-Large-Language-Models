Parts for a reliable and field ready biosensing platform
Implementation of biosensors in real world situations has been made difficult by the unpredictable and non-quantified outputs of existing solutions, as well as a lack of appropriate storage, distribution and utilization systems. This leaves a large gap between a simple, functional sensing mechanism and a fully realised product that can be used in the field. We aim to bridge this gap at all points by developing a standardised ratiometric luciferase output in a Bacillus chassis. This output can be linked up with prototyped instrumentation and software for obtaining reliable quantified results. Additionally, we have reduced the specialized requirements for the storage and distribution of our bacteria by using Bacillus' sporulation system. To improve the performance of our biosensing platform we have genetically modified Bacillus’ germination speed. Lastly, we demonstrated the robustness of our system by testing it with a new fluoride riboswitch, providing the opportunity to tackle real life problems.
One minute tour! :)

iGEM Prizes
All teams are eligible for special prizes at the Jamborees. more... To help the judges, please indicate if you feel you should be evaluated for any of the following special prizes:
√Best Human Practice Advance
√Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
Please explain briefly why you should receive any of these special prizes:
Best Human Practice Advance:
We feel that we deserve this prize for three reasons:
We explored the impacts, *both positive and negative*, of synthetic biology as a solution to real world problems, through interviewing professionals working in a relevant field, namely the impact of arsenic water contamination in Bangladesh.
We recognized existing problems with the way the current direction of synthetic. On going through the registry we found that most of the characterization data for biosensing parts is often neither comparable nor replicable. We have worked to solve this issue, for example with our ratiometric dual channel output.
*Our project doesn’t stop here*, in Chanel number 6 ( Team:Cambridge/HumanPractices/FutureDirections ) we considered the future implications and technological applications of our project, as well as the means by which it could be improved by subsequent users. We feel that the end to an iGEM project should not be the conclusion of an idea, but the start of it.
Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:
It is absolutely vital that a quantitative, numerical, robust, and flexible measurement approach exists to relay information to a user that is an accurate representation of the input processed by a biological device. Working from these principles, the following was done:
We designed and built Biologger, a *cheap, arduino-based, fully functional automatic rotary device* that has an incorporated ratiolumnometer
Our project is entirely open-sourced and open-platform. We have published source code for the two applications which serve to operate the device, one for PCs and the other for Android devices, as well as the open source circuit design that provides this ratiometric reading. Furthermore, the Android app is able to receive its data wirelessly, which we feel is a great advance in BioBrick measurement.
Our dual-channel luciferase reporter was successfully tested with a dilution series of E.coli transformed with the Lux Operon (under pBAD) biobrick (Part  BBa_K325909) of the Cambridge iGEM 2010 team. It can detect, with good accuracy, both different light intensities, as well as the percentages of blue or orange frequencies in a sample.
Our device was successfully tested using artificial light to detect different frequencies (colours) as well.
Having done all the above, we believe that this fully open-sourced instrumentation kit (mechanical) chassis, electronics, software code), estimated at *$35.00* (or $85.00 if a Bluetooth modem is required), is a complete BioBrick measurement solution for any and all BioBricks with a light output.

Team_Parts
To help the judges evaluate your parts, please identify 3 of your parts that you feel are best documented and are of the highest quality.
Best new BioBrick part (natural)
BBa_K911003
Best new BioBrick part (engineered)
BBa_K911004
Best improved part(s): None
List any other parts you would like the judges to examine: BBa_K911001 , BBa_K911009 , BBa_K911008
Please explain briefly why the judges should examine these other parts:
Magnesium Sensitive Riboswitch BBa_K911001
As a riboswitch sensing construct, this part is an entirely new type of biosensor (along with the fluoride construct) that could potentially change the way we think about designing input genetic circuits. Unlike the fluoride riboswitch, it is a derepression system and therefore serves to demonstrate the principle that riboswitches can be used regardless of whether they turn on or off their reporter.
Fluorescent ratiometric construct for standardizing promoter output BBa_K911009
Fluorescence is a major cornerstone for biosensors in the registry, however, most parts do not involve the use of a ratiometric output, which has been shown in the literature to provide much more reliable and meaningful data. This part not only furthers the development of ratiometric measurements in molecular biology but due to the choice of promoters and terminators it can be used to characterize the difference in activity between E. coli and B. Subtilis
Fast Germination (B. subtilis) BBa_K911008
This part is entirely novel for the registry and fully utilizes the recombination machinery inherent in the Bacillus chassis. Have spores that can germinate at a faster rate is certainly a worthy achievement and could help with experiments with B. Subtilis that any future iGEM teams may wish to perform.

The Final Month
Monday
Andreas fully tested the instrumentation today. A dilution series was made to test the sensitivity of the sensor in the right geometry. More details can be found in the lab-book.
Still no successful ligations for the biobricks, as a couple of colony PCRs show. Looks like the insert for the SpoVA biobrick may not have been digested. Oops...
The platereader also gets a thorough workout, as we try one last assay on our magnesium riboswitch construct. 24 hours later, we might get some nice data.
We persevere though. While some of us concentrate on making the wiki presentable, Emmy and Oli (though mostly Emmy) set up 5 more biobricking restriction ligation reactions. Bands from the gels are beautifully pure, so we're hoping for at least one success.
Alas, the transformants only get plated out at 11 am.
Tuesday
Days have become a bit arbitrary now, haven't they? The last entry only finished at 11 o'clock.
Andreas tested the instrumentation for colour recognition. More details can be found in the Lab book.  Wiki dominates proceedings from now on, unfortunately (or fortunately? It's certainly easier to do than ligations). Emmy seems keen to sacrafice her own well being for the success of the wiki, having stayed up all night working on t-shirt designs and then staying until midnight to get some more design work done. She finally goes home after a 36 hour shift - I doubt any of the rest of us can really have reason to complain.
Unfortunately, we still haven't got any colonies on the ligation plates. On the bright side, there aren't any on the positive transformation control plate either, so perhaps not so desperate as we feared. We'll have to be patient and see what happens tomorrow.
And Jolyon sets out to try the Miller assay one last time. Even though it worked pretty well last time, we'd still like some more data to average out.
Wednesday
The final day is here, and we're dedicated to getting the wiki as presentable as possible. Thank God Emmy hasn't been stricken by some disease that strikes down the poorly rested.
Not that wet work has completely passed us by, on this, our final day. As I write, a plate reader assay is running to check if Ratiometrica works as expected. On top of this, Stuart is taking a time lapse series of photos to see if our promoter speeds up germination as expected. See our final characterization data on the results page , as well as the respective pages for each of our parts.
Plus, we finally got some colonies on the ligation plates! Unfortunately, colony PCR with the sequencing primers reveals that all we have is recircularized backbone. We don't even know how it managed to do this, because we treated the vector with alkaline phosphatase. It seems that the ligation fairy is simply not smiling on us.
Thursday
Well. I did say yesterday was our final day. But you know, Wiki-ing is just so addictive, it's impossible to shut it out until the last possible moment. So this is it - the final hours. It's been a ridiculous ride over the last three months, and even though some of our experiments didn't go exactly to plan (I'm looking at you, platereader, destroyer of dreams) it's impossible to deny that we've learnt a great deal. So, nothing left to say but - See you in Amsterdam!
Goodbye! Farewell! Auf wiedersehen! Adieu!
Now get back to work!
