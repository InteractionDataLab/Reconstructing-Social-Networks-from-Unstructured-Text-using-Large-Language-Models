			Plasmids for the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Penn_State/Projects#Project 2 : Multidirectional Promoters">Multidirectional Promoters Project</A> were transformed and cultured by Hannah and Kevin. Chris, Kait, and Victoria re-transformed 10 plasmids and cultured those. A gel was run to confirm our plasmids and fragments but was inconclusive due to low concentration.
		</P><P><B>Thursday, May 31, 2012</B>
			Fragments for the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Penn_State/Projects#Project 2 : Multidirectional Promoters">Multidirectional Promoter Project</A> were digested and run through PCR by Hannah and Kevin. Kait and Victoria re-transformed the remaining 10 plasmids and 1 from yesterday that did not yield colonies. Kait and Victoria ran a gel to confirm a plasmid they could use in the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Penn_State/Projects#Project 1 : Codon Optimization">Codon Optimization Project</A>. 
			The originally transformed promoters were disposed of. Some of the cultures became a purple color. After centrifuging it was shown that the bacteria themselves were purple. This may be from contamination, so to be on the safe side, these plasmids were re-transformed. This may be an artifact from the plasmids themselves, but there is no consistent pattern. Very strange indeed! Always remember to use good sterile techniques when working with media and cultures!

			Victoria prepared and stored cultures containing plasmids for the Codon Optimization Project. Hannah and Kevin extracted plasmids from colonies from Hannah's CBAR reaction. These were then digested and run on a gel. Kevin and Chris ran a PCR to produce a component for the final construct for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. The first reaction did not yield the expected results. Two more were prepared for comparison. 
		</P><P><B>Tuesday, June 19, 2012</B>
			Hannah and Kevin extracted plasmids from the CBAR cultures again to get a higher yield for sequencing. Victoria and Alexander worked on the Codon Optimization construct by culturing insert components. They also extracted plasmids with the desired components for the final construct. These components were digested, run in a gel, extracted, and Cleaned and Concentrated. Kevin and Chris ran a gel to compare the PCR runs set up yesterday. This showed that the PCR runs had not yielded the desired components. Another PCR run was prepared and run a lower temperature for better annealing. Hannah ran a gel of her CBAR plasmid digests to see if they contained the correct parts. Unfortunately both gels showed that the plasmids were self ligations of a single component of the construct.

They will be tested to see if they contain the complete construct for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. Victoria, Kait, and Alexander worked on ligating components for the Codon Optimization Project. They also grew cultures containing components they would need later on in the assembly. Hannah ran PCR on some new segments of her final construct that just came in. These were later run in a CBAR. This new set of components would be better and produce the desired construct. 
		</P><P><B>Wednesday, June 27, 2012</B>
			The cultures from the CBAR for the Multidirectional Promoters Project were mini-prepped and tested to see if they contained the correct components for the final construct. The gel to check this unfortunately did not set correctly and the cultures needed to be redone. Fortunately, Kevin had made a backup. Some additional colonies were also cultured to expand the search. Hannah worked on the sequencing primers for the Multidirectional Promoter construct. She also continued work on a document combining all of the protocols we use in the lab. Kait and Victoria completed digestions and ligations for the construction of their construct for the Codon Optimization Project. 
		</P><P><B>Thursday, June 28, 2012</B>
			Cultures from the Multidirectional Promoters Project CBAR reaction were mini-prepped, again. 4 additional colonies were prepped to expand the search for the correct construct. These were then digested in preparation for use in a gel to confirm length. Hannah ran PCR on components for the Multiple Start Codon construct. She also inoculated cultures with colonies from one of her new CBAR reactions. Victoria, Kait, and Alexander worked on their own PCR runs to make the new Codon Optimization construct. 
		</P><P><B>Friday, June 29, 2012</B>
			Hannah ran another PCR for one of her new G-blocks. She then mini-prepped cultures from her CBAR reaction. Some of the colonies seemed to be red, indicating they had taken up a plasmid with at least some of the desired components. Kait and Alexander ran gels to digest components and PCR products in preparation for an assembly of the construct for the Codon Optimization Project.

			Chris received his sequencing data. It looked promising, however parts of it seemed inconclusive. He cultured this strain in preparation for testing it by inserting a promoter. Victoria ran a PCR reaction for some of the components for the Codon Optimization Project. Victoria and Alexander worked to make master cultures of components for the Codon Optimization Project. 
		</P><P><B>Wednesday, July 11, 2012</B>
			Victoria, Kait, and Alexander mini-prepped cultures in preparation for sequencing. Chris transformed a plasmid, BBa_J23102, to use to test a construct that looks positive for having all the parts from the CBAR. Victoria also ran a digestion on the plasmids she prepared earlier to see if they possessed the correct restriction sites. The plasmids that looked promising were sent to sequencing. Kevin made more progress with the animation. He also worked with Nikki to help plan out the flow of the website.
		</P><P><B>Thursday, July 12, 2012</B>
			Chris checked his results from sequencing. With help from Hannah, he was able to conclude that there was a good chance that the plasmid was the desired construct. Hannah also checked her results from sequencing plasmids from her colonies from her second CBAR reaction. Her results showed to be negative, in response she ran another CBAR. Chris mini-prepped the J23102 that he grew up yesterday in preparation of inserting it into his suspected construct. Victoria ran a PCR for a fragment of the Codon Optimization Project, and cleaned the product of a previous PCR. Kevin made progress and created all new home and team pages. He also managed to get the navigation bar working, albeit in a crude format. 
		</P><P><B>Friday, July 13, 2012</B>
			Chris checked the concentration of some of his mini-preps in preparation for sequencing and ligations. Victoria transformed some plasmids to be able to check them later for the desired parts. Victoria worked with Jyotsna to find some of the needed parts for the Codon Optimization Project. Kevin updated some of the webpages and poured some plates.

			Chris ran some mini-preps for the Multidirectional Promoters Project. Victoria revved the results of her sequencing with Kait. Kevin worked with Hannah and taught her some HTML. 
		</P><P><B>Tuesday, July 17, 2012</B>
			Hannah came in early to mini-prep cultures from her most recent CBAR for the Multiple Start Codon Project. These were subsequently digested to check for proper length. The result of this gel raised some questions. The colonies that she had grown up were all expression RFP. There were some colonies that were expressing GFP, but these were not cultured. Analysis of the gel and expression of RFP indicates that those plasmids did not contain all of the correct components. The GFP colonies probably would contain the entire construct. These were cultured to test this hypothesis. Victoria worked with Jyotsna to design primers to make some of the necessary parts for the Codon Optimization Project construct. Alexander is also beginning presentations for describing all of the projects. Kevin made some headway with the animation, which is till humming along. He also prepared materials for making new Chemically Competent cells. 
		</P><P><B>Wednesday, July 18, 2012</B>
			Kevin updated some of the website and made some new chemically competent cells. Hannah and Kevin then transformed a number of fluorescent protein plasmids into these new cells. Hannah prepped her GFP presenting colonies from her CBAR. These were then digested to check them for length. The correct plasmids were prepped to be sent to sequencing. Victoria planned and designed primers for the Codon Optimization Project. 
		</P><P><B>Thursday, July 19, 2012</B>
			Victoria ran a PCR of one of her components for the Codon Optimization Project. Hannah sent her plasmids to sequencing. Some of the plasmids that she transformed yesterday with Kevin were successful and presenting the correct fluorescent protein. Chris ran a gel on the construct for the Multidirectional Promoter Project. Kait and Victoria transformed some plasmids in preparation for another PCR to make a fragment for the Codon Optimization Project. 
		</P><P><B>Friday, July 20, 2012</B>
			Victoria and Alexander completed a ligation to hopefully give them their desired construct. Kevin created a new run of chemically competent cells for the lab. Hannah ran a PCR of one of the components of her construct. This was to test to see if the deletion in the construct was caused by the PCR or if the problem resided somewhere else. Victoria also completed a digestion of a plasmid to check its length. 
		</P><P><B>Saturday, July 21, 2012</B>
			Hannah transformed and plated her partial construct to have it as a back-up to work from to insert the deleted piece.

		</P><P><B>Tuesday, July 24, 2012</B>
			Hannah ran a PCR on the vector component for the Multiple Start Codon Project. She proceeded to complete another CBAR to try and get the missing segment into the construct. Kait and Victoria inserted a fragment into their vector backbone. This will hopefully yield the construct for the Codon Optimization Project. Kevin ran a gel extraction and cleanup on a gel run by Chris. 
		</P><P><B>Wednesday, July 25, 2012</B>
			Chris completed some annealings for inserts for his construct for the Bidirectional Promoter Project (formerly known as the Multidirectional Promoter Project). Kait and Victoria ran some miniprepps and plated some cultures to create stocks of their construct components for the Codon Optimization Project. Hannah learned more about working with webpages. Kevin made some more progress with the animation. 
		</P><P><B>Thursday, July 26, 2012</B>
			Chris completed some transformation into new CC and old CC. This will not only show if his construct is correct, but also determine how good the new CC are. Hannah ran some transformations to see if she got the completed construct for the Multiple Start Codon Project. Victoria tracked down the required materials for running flow cytometry on samples when the Codon Optimization Construct is completed. Kevin made more headway with the animation. 
		</P><P><B>Friday, July 27, 2012</B>
			Kait completed 12 mini-preps of two components needed for one of the assembly methods for the Codon Optimization Project's construct. She also made some stock cultures for the freezer for long-term storage. She also picked some colonies and cultured them. Kevin continued work on the animation. 
		</P><P><B>Saturday, July 28, 2012</B>
			Kevin came in to check on some transformations Chris had plated. Unfortunately, all of the plates showed no growth.
