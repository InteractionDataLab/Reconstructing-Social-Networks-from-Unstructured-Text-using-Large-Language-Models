What is it?
Vallenato is a super simple jQuery based accordion script. There are plenty of other great accordion scripts out there to choose from, so why use Vallenato? Well, it's easy to implement, looks good, is flexible, and of course...it's free. This page is an example of Vallenato in action!

Installation
First, unzip the "vallenato.zip" file and place the "vallenato" folder in the same directory as the html file(s) that will be using the script. If placed in a different folder, you will need to update the paths below.
In the <head> section of your html you will need to link to jQuery, the Vallenato script and stylesheet. You can use the following code:
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="vallenato/vallenato.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="vallenato/vallenato.css" type="text/css" media="screen">
Mark Up
Mark up is simple and straight forward, just use the following code as a template:
<div id="accordion-container">
     <h2 class="accordion-header">Section 1</h2>
     <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Section 1 Content</p>
     </div>
     <h2 class="accordion-header">Section 2</h2>
     <div class="accordion-content">
          <p>Section 2 Content</p>
     </div>
</div>
