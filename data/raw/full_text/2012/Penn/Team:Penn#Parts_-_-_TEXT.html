INPNC-MCS (Multiple Cloning Site): Winner of "Best BioBrick, Engineered" at Americas East
A multiple cloning site version of Ice Nucleation Protein that can be used for surface display experiments. The associated MCS and GS short amino acid linker allows for rapid generation of fusion proteins for surface display. Expression of INPNC fusion proteins will traffic to the cell membrane. See BBa_K811005
ClyA
Cytolysin A is a 34kDa protein that is capable of inducing rapid cell lysis in mammalian cells through the formation of a pore complex in the plasma membrane. See BBa_K811000
His-ClyA
A N-terminus his-tagged version of clyA that is ideal for IMAC protein purification and western blotting. See BBa_K811001
ClyA-His
A C-terminus his-tagged version of clyA that is ideal for IMAC protein purification and western blotting. See BBa_K811002
INPNC
A truncated N-C terminus version of Ice Nucleation Protein that can be used for surface display experiments. Expression of INPNC fusion proteins will traffic to the cell membrane. See BBa_K811003
INPNC-HA
A C-terminus HA-tagged version of Ice Nucleation Protein that can be used for surface display experiments. The HA tag allows for visualization of INPNC localization through immunocytochemistry and western blotting. Expression of INPNC fusion proteins will traffic to the cell membrane. See BBa_K811004
