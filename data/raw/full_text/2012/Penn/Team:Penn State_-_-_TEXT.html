Questioning Central Dogma
The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology is the foundation of modern-day synthetic, molecular, and microbiology. While countless innovations in medicine and technology are based on the truth of the doctrine, it does not always accurately predict results in the lab. The Penn State iGEM team questions the central dogma with genetic constructs explore deviations from the norm.

Welcome!
Welcome to the Penn State iGEM page! Here you can find information on all of our projects , progress , achievements , and much more.
We are currently working on three projects that question the dogma of the Central Dogma of Biology. The Central Dogma is the commonly held belief that within biology, information flows from the order of nucleotides in DNA to the order of nucleotides in RNA and finally to the order of amino acids in a protein. These proteins then go on to complete a variety of functions that make life work.
Molecular biology can be challenging to understand. Check out our Synthetic Biology For Dummies animation below!
