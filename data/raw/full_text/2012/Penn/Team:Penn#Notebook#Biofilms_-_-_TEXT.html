Set up equipment
Autoclaved 2x 1L Sterile ddH2O
Autoclaved 500 mL LB Broth for scale up of luxS (Plate 3 Well 2H, pSB1A2), plsr (Plate 2 Well 14H in pSB1A2 resistance to Amp)
Added iGEM logo to wiki
6/7/12
Resuspended available biobricks luxS & plsr (resuspended in 10uL ddH2O)

Requested lsrR & lsrK from iGEM HQ
6/8/12
iGEM Wiki now split into two separate Notebooks
Plenty of colonies, too many to count(TMTC) grew from plsr & luxS transformation from 6/7/12
Selected one colony each
Grew in 10 mL LB+Amp (100 ug/mL)
Contacted researchers for V. harveyi bioassay & lysostaphin, V. harveyi must be purchased through ATCC ($300), lysostaphin obtained thru MTA.
6/9/12
~2mL of LB evaporated during incubation

[plsr]=112 ng/uL
[luxS]=114 ng/uL
6/11/12-6/16/12
Dry lab work
6/18/12
Obtained & resuspended primers for eGFP & plsr
6/19/12
performed PCR w/ NEB standard taq kit w/ primers for eGFP & plsr
Tested 2 annealing temperatures, 55C and 50C
Ran gel w/ PCR product (2% agarose), saw clear eGFP bands, but possible .1kb obscured by loading dye.
6/20/12
Performed qiagen PCR purification & nanodropped (it like it's hot)
6/21/12
Ran gel of yesterday's PCR purification
Image of 2% Agarose Gel of post-purification PCR products of eGFP (.85kb) & plsr (.1kb)
EtBr Gel 2% Agarose
Lane 1: NEB 2-log ladder (1 ug loaded)
Lane 2: PCR of eGFP using plsr_XhoI Fwd & eGFP_EcoRI Rev primers w/ 55C annealing temp.
Lane 3: PCR of plsr using plsr_BglII Fwd & plsr_XhoI Rev primers w/ 55C annealing temp.
Lane 4: PCR of eGFP using plsr_XhoI Fwd & eGFP_EcoRI Rev primers w/ 50C annealing temp.
Lane 5: PCR of plsr using plsr_BglII Fwd & plsr_XhoI Rev primers w/ 50C annealing temp.
Lane6/7: Null
Lane 8: 1kb ladder left at rt o/n
Obtained & transformed pET-26b
6/22/12
Miniprepped pet26b and digested with BglII and EcorR
6/25/12
Ran gel of eGFP/plsr ligation
Ordered restriction enzymes from the Cell Center
6/26/12
Attempted Gel Purification of digest products from 2/25/12
Yields for Gel purification were too low to be useful (>1 ng/uL)
Digested purified PCR rxns (annealing temperature=55C)
6/27/12
Ran gel of digested PCR rxns (55C), found no evidence of successful digestion.
6/28/12
Purified digest and attempted
6/29/12
Performed digest of pET-26b, eGFP, and plsr
Spread Biobrick shipment on Amp plates (lsrR, lsrK)
7/2/12
Selected colonies from lsrK and lsrR streaked plates
Grew in 10mL TB Broth
7/3/12
Ran gel of ligated product, no size shift, unlikely that ligation was successful.
Ligation rxn transformed to make sure
7/5/12
Ligation transformation of pET-26-plsr-GFP failed, no colonies present
Talked to Dan:
When using primers to introduce restriction sites into
7/6/12
Redesigned primers for plsr & egfp
Set up TC Incubator & hood
Contacted people in the FDA thru personal contacts for human practices
7/9/12
Made Inactivating Solution for restriction digest
50mM EDTA (pH=8.0)
50% Glycerol
Planned test restriction digest pET-26b troubleshooting tomorrow
Trained new users for Tissue Culture
7/10/12
Troubleshooting of pET-26 digestion
Digest of pET-26b w/ BglII and XhoI
Time course:
10 min
30 min
3 hr
6 hr
o/n
Inactivate w/ Inactivating Solution (10uL/50uL of restriction reaction)
Nikita, Ashwin, Avin all have acceptable sterile practice
Resuspended IDT luxS synthesized DNA
Transformed synthesized luxS into DH5a
7/11/12
Ran 2% gel of digest, did not see signs of any restriction
Re-planned pET-26b digest troubleshooting
Selected luxS colonies
7/12/12
Thawed out 293T-CMV-Gaussia cells from Sarkar LN2
Miniprepped luxS colony, digested w/ BamHI-HF & EcoRI-HF

7/13/12
Passaged 293T-CMV-Gaussia cells 1:10 & 1:5 for weekend
Ligation of luxS w/ pET-26b
Ligation rxn transformed into DH5a
7/14/12
Ligation showed successful transformants
7/15/12
Colonies selected by Mike, grown in 10mL LB
7/16/12
SAAST Presentation
Miniprep of 10mL pET-26b-luxS cultures
Ran gel of minipreps from 3 pET-26b-luxS colonies to confirm successful ligation
pET-26b-luxS #1/#2 are slightly larger, indicating successful ligation, not as sure for pET-26b-luxS #3
Last lane is unligated pET-26b vector
Image of 1% Agarose Gel of Miniprep products of pET-26b-luxS from three colonies
7/17/12
Ran gel to determine if insertion of pET-26b-luxS was correctly ligated
Gel showed there was a possible size shift corresponding to insertion in all three selected colonies of pET-26b-luxS colonies
Image of 2% Agarose Gel of PCR products of eGFP (.85kb) & plsr (.1kb)
From left to right (optimum temperatures bolded): Ladder, plsr @45C,52C,58C,65C, egfp @52C,58C,65C
Performed 100uL PCR of plsr @65 & 100uL PCR of egfp @58 for further ligation experiments.
