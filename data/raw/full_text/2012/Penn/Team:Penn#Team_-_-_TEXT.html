Our Team
The Penn iGEM 2012 Team consists of 4 undergraduates, 3 advisors, and many others who have provided important contributions along the way. Together, we have learned a lot over the last few months. We have taught ourselves different protocols and developed new standards to synchronize our work. Through our participation in iGEM, we have collaborated to learn more about synthetic biology - from the initial days of cloning constructs to the final days of imaging and analysis. Our idea for spatio-temporal control of drug delivery first originated in late May after weeks of reading papers. Slowly we have been able to piece together different components of the system to help the project materialize to the system it is today. We believe our work in optogenetics and drug delivery has a promising future and we are excited to share our results at the World Championships!

Advisors
Dr. Casim A. Sarkar
Dr. Casim A. Sarkar is the Principal Investigator of the Molecular Cell Engineering Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Bioengineering. His research interests include molecular cell engineering, protein engineering, ligand/receptor binding and trafficking, cell signaling and decision making, and computational, synthetic, and systems biology. Dr. Sarkar received a PhD in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Computational Biology at MIT and a BS in Chemical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.
Dr. Mark Goulian
Dr. Mark Goulian is the Edmund J. and Louise W. Kahn Endowed Term Professor of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania. His research is focused on the regulatory circuits that bacteria use to sense and respond to the environment. His other research interests include two-component signaling in E. coli and directed evolution of signaling circuits. Dr. Goulian received his PhD from Harvard University.
Dr. Jordan S. Miller
Dr. Jordan S. Miller is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania in Dr. Christopher S. Chen's Tissue Microfabrication Laboratory in the Department of Bioengineering. He is currently also a board member of Hive76 and before his time at Penn, he was a developer at RepRap and and an associate at PTV Sciences. Dr. Miller received a PhD from Rice University and earned his undergraduate degree from MIT.
