Submitted Biobricks
Here you can find a list of all BioBricks we submitted to the registry during our work on LOV: <groupparts>iGEM012 Bonn</groupparts>
We will submit our basic LOV protein for coupling purposes, in the meanwhile, we will submit control vectors expressing our three different effector proteins under LacI induction. We will also send in our final kill switch and proof-of-principle devices.
We have sent in physical DNA for mazF ( BBa_K302033 ), which so far is missing in the registry and according to the team that designed the part is also missing in their storage freezers. We thus offer our mazF brick as physical DNA for BBa_K302033.
We have sent in a new biobrick mazF-TT ( BBa_K820014 ), which contains mazF (K302033) and a double terminator.
