During the competition, the iGEM Team Bonn 2012 raised money, purchased lab equipment, planned and did all the lab work, organized public outreach events, spoke to the media, planned their jamboree trip and worked on their Wiki and documentation.
Many people helped us during the project. Without this help, our project would have never been possible. People who gave us advice, instructions, new ideas or helped us out with new materials and stuff.
In biweekly meetings with our instructors and advisors we talked about our achievements and discussed what we needed to do next.  So lots of credit goes to Prof. Dr. Günter Mayer, Prof. Dr. Michael Famulok, Katia Schöler, Silvana Haßel, Anna Hall, Martina Bettio and many other people in the lab for their patience and help!
We also want to thank our sponsors , without them the project would not even have started. Thank you for supporting our work!
Sequencing
Gene sequencing was paid by the labs of our instructors. Thank you for the support!
Support for SynBio Info Day
A special thanks to all the companies that supported us with materials for the tombola at our SynBio Info Day: Helios Klinikum Wuppertal GmbH, Volksbank Bonn Rhein-Sieg eG, Westdeutscher Rundfunk Köln, Deutsches Rotes Kreuz Kreisverband Bonn e.V., Carl Roth GmbH & Co. KG and Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG. We also thank LMU-Munich who provided the press release for all German iGEM teams.
LOV Samples
To track down our LOVTAP issues, we requested LOV samples from other iGEM teams and LMU-Munich and TU Darmstadt were so kind to provide us with the requested plasmids. Many thanks for doing this from the whole team! We also thank the Sosnick Lab at the University of Chicago for providing us with their LOVTAP fusion construct and Vincent Noireaux from the University of Minnesota for his mazF plasmid.
