This page contains activities the iGEM-Team Bonn did in 2012 which are not (directly) related to our work at the lab.
Conference Visits and Poster Presentations
"Strategieprozess Biotechnologie 2020+", Berlin, Germany
We were invited by the German Ministry of Education and Research to attend a national biotechnology conference and present a project poster in June 2012 in Berlin, Germany, along with the other 10 German iGEM teams. During the conference, we made good use of the opportunity to network with other iGEM teams and discussed collaborations, coordinated human outreach projects and general research topics in a separate iGEM session. Our SynBio Info Day (see below) is one of the results of our deliberations.
CAS Synthetic Biology Conference, Munich
In July, the LMU Munich iGEM Team invited us to the CAS Synthetic Biology conference, where we were able to present a poster detailing our project to a wider scientific audience. In addition to deliberating with the other iGEM teams, we were able to gain insights into current synthetic biology topics.
Video Dubbing
We translated a video from English to German, which informs briefly about Synthetic Biology. The translation contains not just subtitles but a full video dubbing. We also got permission to redistribute our changed version from the authors of the original video. All material is released under a CC-BY-SA-NC license, as the original video is too. Here is the result of our work:

We provided this video to all other German iGEM-Teams for their presentations about Synthetic Biology at the SynBio Info Day.
SynBio Info Day
The team at our information booth
We did a Synthetic Biology information day to inform the population about the chances and possible risks that come with Synthetic Biology and to raise awareness for this awesome new technology. We created information posters and did an information booth at the city centre of Bonn. The people who came to our stand were all interested in the topic of genetic manipulation and we informed them about Synthetic Biology as well, a topic which was known only to very few of them. In general the demand for knowledge about genetic manipulation and what scientists really do in their labs was very high. We were able to clarify many myths which were spread about it, by providing neutral information about the topic. We also had our posters, which not only presented Synthetic Biology and of course the iGEM competetion, but also gave some general information about genetics.
The German SynBio Info Day was an effort by us and most other German iGEM teams ( TU Munich , LMU Munich , TU Darmstadt , Göttingen , Marburg , Tübingen and Bielefeld ) to inform about Synthetic Biology.
Interview with Deutschlandfunk (German radio station)
The German radio station "Deutschlandfunk" visited and interviewed us. A short segment about iGEM and our project aired on 26th September 2012. Click here to read and listen to the segment (only German language available).
iGEM on biotechnologie.de
Another article with interviews is posted on biotechnologie.de, the information platform of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Click here to read the article (only German language available).
Supporting surveys
We supported the LMU Munich and University of British Columbia in answering their surveys about the Standardization of BioBrick part descriptions (LMU) and Intellectual Property (UBC) .
