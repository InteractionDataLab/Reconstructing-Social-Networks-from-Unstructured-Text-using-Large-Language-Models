First, wikitext is  what you call the stuff that you type into the box when editing a page. It gets processed into text, layout, images, and so on when the page is viewed.
The most basic system for organizing information on a wiki page is the section. The headers above are themselves sections. In order to make a section, you simply write the title of the section, then surround it by a certain number of equals signs. Below are some sections of different levels, and to the right is how they would appear in the table of contents.
Contents
1 Section 1
1.1 Subsection 1A
1.1.1 Subsubsection 1Ai
1.2 Subsection 1B
1.2.1 Subsubsection 1Bi
2 Section 2
2.1 Subsection 2A
Section 1
Subsection 1A
Subsubsection 1Ai
Subsection 1B
Subsubsection 1Bi
Section 2
Subsection 2A
And here's how it would look when you write it in wikitext:
==Section 1== ===Subsection 1A=== ====Subsubsection 1Ai==== ===Subsection 1B=== ====Subsubsection 1Bi==== ==Section 2== ===Subsection 2A===
Now, continue to the rest of the tutorial .
