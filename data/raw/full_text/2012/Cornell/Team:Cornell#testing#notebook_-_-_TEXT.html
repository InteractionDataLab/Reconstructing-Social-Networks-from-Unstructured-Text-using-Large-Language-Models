Wet Lab
All biological elements of the project. This includes the development of the genetic constructs, transforming the genetic constructs into various organisms, and the characterization of growth and function of the genetically modified organisms.
Dry Lab
The non-biological elements of the project. This includes the design and fabrication of the device, including all electrical parts and software, as well as the mathematical modeling and simulations of the project details.
Strain List
A list of all the common strains in our project, provided for reference.  This information includes the plasmids contained by each organism, a description of the plasmids, the resistance the strains will have, and more.

Attributions Note
All design, planning, and bench-scale work was performed by Cornell undergraduates. The team would also like to acknowledge and thank Dr. Jeff Gralnick of the University of Minnesota for providing strains of Shewanella oneidensis. In addition, we are indebted to the following Cornell University professors: Dr. Eugene Madsen for strains of Pseudomonas putida G7; Dr. Shivaun Archer for lab space and equipment access; Dr. Lars Angenent for lab space and bioelectrochemical reactors; and Dr. Matthew DeLisa for advisors and lab space to train our members during "bootcamp" at the beginning of the summer.
