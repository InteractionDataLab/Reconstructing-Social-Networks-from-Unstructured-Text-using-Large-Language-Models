Dry Lab
Awesome pictures of awesome people doing stuff, getting dirty, building things, cranking out code, writing equations, pretending to write equations while we take pictures of them and just plain being awesome.

Wet Lab
Pictures of all the random, fun shenanigans that happened this year in the lab (all while exhibiting proper safety of course).  It's actually just a bunch of pictures of us making duckface while pipetting (just kidding...probably).

Outreach
Pictures of us teaching anyone who will listen all about synthetic biology, the environment and how our project is going to save the world some day (or at least a couple watersheds).
