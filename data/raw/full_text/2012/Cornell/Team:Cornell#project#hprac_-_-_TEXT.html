Beyond the Bench
This year, we set out with three main goals in mind:
Assess the environmental risks associated with our project,
evaluate the applicability of our device to a variety of applications, and
educate the public about synthetic biology and how it pertains to everyday life.
To these ends, we adopted a novel approach to risk assessment and discussed our project in great detail with the Oil Sands Leadership Initiative, local water monitoring groups, environmental groups, scientific researchers and more. Please click the links to the left to explore!
