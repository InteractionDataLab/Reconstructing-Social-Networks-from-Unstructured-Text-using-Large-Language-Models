The purpose of this subproject is to make the nah operon biobrick compatible for the use of future iGEM teams. The nah operon codes for a pathway that converts naphthalene into salicylate. In our system, this will allow naphthalene to be detected by the salicylate reporter. There are three standard cut sites internal to the operon which we are removing - PstI, and two NotI sites. This biobrick compatible piece could be useful to future teams in projects that involve bioremediation or detection of naphthalene. Back to nah operon week view
