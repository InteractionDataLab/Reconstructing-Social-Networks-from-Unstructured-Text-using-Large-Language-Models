September 6th
Work continues as usual. However, there is word of a new team website. Details
Entry:
Earlier this week, I met Manny and Dan at the machine shop after lunch. The 4 inch diameter aluminum rods were too thick to be cut on the bandsaw. Additionally, they couldn’t fit into the lathes, so we needed to either CNC or get the machinists over at Clark Hall to cut it for us via waterjet. With nothing to machine, Manny went ahead and cut the clear tubing to be used for the canister body.
Lydia and Paras made some progress in fixing the communication issue between the Arduino Mega ADK and computer. Meanwhile, Kelvin fixed random bugs in the client, partially dabbling in aesthetics, such as adding a border and shifting the time and date stamps in the output table.
Although we haven’t heard from Eric in a while, we now know that that there is a prototype with the general format and a structure for the notebook that we discussed during mid-June. These blog entries will soon be able to move into their online house.

We manned up and machined canister caps, but efforts were outshone by Rafael’s impressive animations. Details
Entry:
Dan worked on the receptacle for the case, and looked up strainers as an alternative to sediment filters. Dan also asked about waterjet cutting service at Clark Hall. We found someone who would cut it for us, but we ultimately decided it was easier and cheaper to make the caps out of polycarbonate instead of aluminum. This way, we could still cut the caps and face the surfaces using the mill instead. Hence, Dan and I headed over to the machine shop today after class to start working on the caps.
Rafael has been working on the animation of the electron transfer across the bacterial cell membrane. He made computer models of CymA, MtrA, MtrB and MtrC protein structures, and played around with Autodesk Maya. In Maya, he created a virtual periplasmic environment for the background, and was able to employ point-on-poly constraints to get the embedded CymA protein to ripple with the surrounding membrane. Most recently, he animated the MtrA - CymA interaction and spent much time adjusting camerawork and lighting.

Plumbers clear the pipeworks, while machinists  and technicians grind on. Details
Entry:
With the chassis assembly completed, Dan turned his attention to pipework. After making a draft of the pipe layout, he ordered pipes, tube fittings, valves pressure gauges and rotameters (for reading flow rate). When the parts came in, Dan and Manny assembled the parts and ziptied sections to a metal mesh, which will be fixed onto the roof of the chassis.
At the machine shop this week, Dan, Manny and I found a lathe head large enough to find the 4 inch diameter food tank caps. Manny drilled input/output holes, while I threaded on the mill. Dan discovered a facing tool on the mill that gives the best finish we have ever seen.
On the more technical side of life, Maneesh wrote a MATLAB function that calculates the optimal distance the biosensor should be from the contamination source. Kelvin received and set up the Android phone to be used in our biosensor; he also asked CIT (Cornell’s information technologies department) about obtaining a static IP but is still waiting for a response.
