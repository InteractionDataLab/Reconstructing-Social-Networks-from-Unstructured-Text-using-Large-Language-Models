Overview
During the summer, we began work by holding a Synthetic Biology Bootcamp at the Delisa Lab.
June
June 12th-16th
June 12th, Tuesday
Today, we began bootcamp!

Set up PCR for four fragments of the nah operon as well as the pBMT-1 backbone, using primers designed to mutate cut-sites concurrently with Gibson Assembly. Also set up a PCR for the entire nah operon. Due to length of the fragments, a longer extension time was chosen.
If Gibson Assembly fails, but we are able to PCR the entire 10kb nah operon, an alternate method of mutation using three sequential site-directed mutageneses will be pursued.
Work done by: Caleb, Claire, Dylan, Spencer, Steven, and Swati

PCR only amplified nah1, nah3, and nah4 - longer fragments (nah2, the full nah operon, and pBMT-1) were not identified on the PCR product gel. Set up another PCR with shorter extension time.

Set up a digestion of the PCR of Gibson Assembly products and ran the digested products on a gel to see if Gibson worked.
Three colonies on plates of DH5α transformed with Gibson Assembly product. Made liquid cultures to miniprep and sequence.

Miniprepped directly transformed Gibson Assembly product for sequencing using the the Gibson nah1F and nah4R primers (each w/ 20 bp overhangs).
Ran undigested miniprep with gel electrophoresis , looking for large bands corresponding to supercoiled DNA. The gel shows distinct bands for all three lanes. We interpreted this to mean that we got product. Submitted for sequencing .

Reactor stuff.
More thorough.
Click to view the details.
Dylan connected second reactor to SP-200, which just arrived back from field use in Alaska. Current was steady at ≈ 20 µA. However, flow through the reactor was paused because the media tank we depleted. Dylan made new media, and will wait overnight to ensure that the reactor reaches steady state. If steady state is indeed reached, we will perturb the reactors with salicylate to start getting more definitive data.
