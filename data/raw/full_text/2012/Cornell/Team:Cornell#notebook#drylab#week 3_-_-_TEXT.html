Focus: Water Pump
Honey, I shrunk the pump! Team is baffled by the micropump. Details
Entry:
We scrapped the marine bilge pump because we found micropumps! They are so small and light that theoretically (and don’t quote me on this) you could swallow it and find it intact 3-5 days later in the bathroom. Most importantly, they fit the flow rate requirement and are low power. Chie calculated that the system with the micropump can run for a month exclusively off of the battery. Of course, this was very exciting news for the team! Afterward, we performed analysis on the battery dimensions--specifically weight and volume. We needed the numbers to fit the constraints of preliminary chassis designs.
On a last note, here is a brief recapitulation. The general layout of operations has been established: a micropump will provide continuous fluid flow through the bioreactor; a compression device will introduce the liquid-based food source into the flow upstream of the bioreactor. Ultimately, the objective is to make a steady state biosensor that can run autonomously for 6 months.
