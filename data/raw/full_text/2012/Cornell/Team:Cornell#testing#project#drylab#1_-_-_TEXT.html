Dry Lab Overview
Drylab: The team responsible for designing and implementing systems necessary to carry out the application of synthetic biology. We believe that the standard of iGEM applications could be greatly improved; we seek to raise the bar.
Our application, "Septimus Prime," pictured right, has been strictly designed to meet a set of functional requirements established by our mission.
It is currently functional and in the testing stage.
Our primary workspace is provided by Professor Bruce Land of Cornell University's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.
2012 Primary Objective: To create a self-sustained field-deployable biosensor using the Cornell iGEM Wetlab engineered strain of Shewanella onidensis for continuous operation over a period  of six months
