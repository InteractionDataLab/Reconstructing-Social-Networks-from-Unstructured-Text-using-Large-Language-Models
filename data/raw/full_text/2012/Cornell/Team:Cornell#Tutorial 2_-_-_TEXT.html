Lists
Lists can be bulleted, numbered, or done manually with indentation. For the most part, you will use bulleted lists.
They work the same way as sections, in that adding more of their symbol will make it a lower-level version.

Links
Link can be made to pages within the iGEM wiki (including other team's pages) or to any site, such as Google.
A really important thing to note is that whenever you're linking to something that we, at Cornell, are putting up, you have to start the link with Team:Cornell/, because all our pages go under that. For example, this tutorial is Team:Cornell/Tutorial 2. Most of the time, you'll want to hide the "Team:Cornell" part, which you can see how to do below.
There are a few tricks to getting the links to point to one place while showing a different name.

Images
A lot can be done with images, but here I will just scratch the surface.

Tables
Tables are incredibly flexible, but most people won't need them. However, the basics are as follows:
A pipe-- the vertical line thing you get with shift+backslash-- makes a cell in the table
If you use an exclamation point instead (at the beginning of the table), you will get a column header
To separate rows, you use a pipe and a dash: |-
You start a table with a curly brace and pipe: {|
You end the table the same way, but with pipe, then the closing curly brace: |}
To change how the table looks and aligns, you put stuff after the first curly brace and pipe
For more detail, see this Wikipedia tutorial .
Example:
{| border="1" !column label 1 !column label 2 |- | column labels are made with exclamation points | row divisions are made with pipe-dash |- | cells are made with pipes | start and end with pipe and curly brace |}
column label 1
column label 2
column labels are made with exclamation points
row divisions are made with pipe-dash
cells are made with pipes
start and end with pipe and curly brace
