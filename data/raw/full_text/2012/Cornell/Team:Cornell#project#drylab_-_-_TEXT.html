How It Works
Scroll over each number to find out more about the components of our device!
Inlet
Water flows into our system, providing a sample to test water quality.
Filter
Prevents foreign microbes from entering and contaminating our reactor.
Pumps
Move water and food to and from the reactor.
Piping and Calibration
Resist corrosion and set flow rates to the optimal level.
Reactors
House bacteria that produce electrical current in response to toxins.
Food Tanks
Supply our bacteria with lactate to keep them alive.
Electronics
Record bacterial current and transmit data wirelessly to the user.
Battery
Keeps our device running.
Solar Panel
Extends the longevity of our device by providing extra power.
Filter
Prevents our microbes from leaving the device.
Outlet
Water flows back to the source.
Support
Keeps the device safe from weather, rocks, and, of course, bears.
The Full Device
In all of its glory.
