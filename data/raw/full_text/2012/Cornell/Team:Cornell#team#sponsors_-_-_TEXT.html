Oil Sands Leadership Initiative
The Oil Sands Leadership Initiative (OSLI) is a collaborative network of companies operating in the       Canadian oil sands. Each OSLI company develops its assets individually, but works collaboratively to       achieve significant improvements in key performance areas: environmental sustainability, social well-       being and economic viability. ConocoPhillips Canada, Nexen Inc., Shell, Canada Statoil Canada, Suncor       Energy Inc. and Total E&P Canada Ltd are Charter members. Together, OSLI have graciously sponsored       iGEM teams to develop new technologies to address challenges in oil sands extraction and reclamation.
Corning Incorporated
Corning Incorporated is the world leader in specialty glass and ceramics. Drawing on more than 160       years of materials science and process engineering knowledge, Corning creates and makes keystone       components that enable high-technology systems for consumer electronics, mobile emissions control,       telecommunications and life sciences. Corning graciously supported our team through donations of       laboratory supplies and has been a strong supporter of Cornell iGEM for the past three years.
Geneious
Geneious is a DNA, RNA and protein sequence alignment, assembly and analysis software platform,       integrating bioinformatic and molecular biology tools into a simple interface. The team would like to       thank them for their donated software which helped us design primers and plan our cloning.
Cornell University
We would like to thank the Cornell College of Engineering for providing material, monetary, and       other resources to the team. The Departments of Biological & Environmental Engineering, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, and Electrical & Computer Engineering have all provided resources and       advice to the team.
Cornell Institute for Biotechnology & Life Sciences Technology
The mission of Cornell’s Biotech Institute is to promote research, education and technology transfer for       applications of biotechnology for the benefit of the environment, agriculture, engineering and veterinary       and human medicine. We would like to thank the institute for their monetary support to the team for the       purchasing of laboratory supplies and equipment.
Weill Institute
The Weill Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, is an interdisciplinary research institute in the heart of      Cornell University's Ithaca, NY campus focusing on cell signaling and molecular dynamics. Weill Hall is      home to the Cornell iGEM lab, space which was graciously donated to us through Prof. Shivaun Archer      also in Weill Hall. The Weill Institute also provided the team with monetary support for purchasing      laboratory supplies and access to equipment.
