Cornell University Genetically Engineered Machines
Cornell iGEM benefits from the contributions of 21 undergraduates, three graduate advisers, one post-doctoral adviser, four Cornell faculty advisers, and one outside faculty adviser, Dr. Jeff Gralnick of the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Our diverse team of undergraduates represents eight majors and three colleges within Cornell University. By building a team with varied and complementary expertise, we are able to design and carry out projects that extend beyond the Petri dish, into the machine shop, and even get a touch of solder.
