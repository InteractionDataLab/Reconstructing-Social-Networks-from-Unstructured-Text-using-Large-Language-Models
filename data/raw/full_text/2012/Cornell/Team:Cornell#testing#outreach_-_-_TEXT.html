Research Presentations
We presented the details of our project to other scientists, in order to raise awareness of the field of synthetic biology and incite constructive discussions regarding the scientific specifications of our project.
Panel Discussions
We used a wide array of open panel discussions on campus to introduce other students to iGEM and synthetic biology, and the possibilities they hold as scientific pursuits.
Public Awareness
Raising public awareness beyond students and the scientific community was crucial to our outreach efforts. We did this through local events and by presenting directly to educators.
