Manel Porcar
I am an enthusiastic applied microbiologist and biotechnologist.
I lead the Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology lab at the Cavanilles      Institute of the University of Valencia, where I work on bioremediation, biofuels production and bioenergetics.
Miguel Lozano
I am a doctor in computer science at the engineering school of the University of València (E.T.S.E) where I am      currently teaching and researching. My research interests mainly include Simulation (numerical and multiagent models)      and Computer Graphics (physics based animation).
Francesc J. Ferri
I am a professor of computer science doing teaching and research on machine perception and learning at the University     of València. My interests go from computer vision applications and data mining to theoretical foundations of computing.
Daniel Ramón Vidal
I made my PhD working at the Dep. of Molecular Genetics of the pharmaceutical company Antibióticos S.A. Then I moved      to the Univ. of Wageningen as a post-doc. I was Professor of Food Tech at CSIC and UV. Currently I am CEO of Biópolis S.L.      My interests are microbial biotech and the production of microbial metabolites. I'm author of more than 100 articles and      co-author of 30 patents. I've obtained the European Prize of Divulgation, the Prize of the Danone Institute, and the      National Price in Technology Transfer.
Andrés Moya
I am a doctor in biology and philosophy.      Experimental evolution and evolutionary genomics are the areas where I have made more significant contributions.
I am the creator of the Cavanilles Institute of Biodiversity and Evolutive Biology at the “Universitat de València” and      of the Advanced Center for Research in Public Health (CSISP). Also, I am a founding member of the European Society of      Evolutionary Biology, the Spanish Society of Virology and the Spanish Society of Evolutionary Biology, of which I am the current President.
Ana Delgado
I do social studies of science and technology at the Centre for the Study of the Sciences and the Humanities, University of      Bergen (Norway).
I work in a project on the ethical, legal and social aspects of synthetic biology.
I have been doing work on other emerging technologies... and on science fiction.
Rosario Gil
I am a Doctor in Pharmacy, and an Associate Professor of Genetics. I teach Genetics, Molecular Genetics and Genomics at the University of Valencia.      As a member of the Evolutionary Genetics group at the Cavanilles Institute of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology, my research interests focus on functional      genomics of endosymbiotic bacteria from insects, minimal genomes, the evolution of metabolism in bacteria and synthetic biology.
Emilia Matallana
I am a teacher of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of Valencia and my research is focused on molecular biology and biotechnology of yeasts,     specifically on oxidative stress responses and technological performance of industrial strains.
Juli Peretó
I am Associate Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of València and member of the Evolutionary Genetics Group at the Cavanilles Institute      for Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology. My research interests include the origin and early evolution of life, with a focus on metabolic pathways evolution, as well      as the minimal cell concept. I am also interested in the history of ideas on the natural origi and the artificial synthesis of life. I like to teach metabolism with an      evolutionary flavor.
Marta Tortajada
I am a chemical engineer, specialized in automatics and system engineering, particularly fond of systems biology.
I work in applied biotechnology in the     company Biopolis, in projects related to the production of microorganisms and valuable metabolites, such as recombinant proteins, active pharmaceutical ingredients,     alcohols and microbial polymers.
Santiago F. Elena
Evolutionary Virology and Systems Group Institute for Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology (IBMCP) National Research Council (CSIC)   I got my Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from the University of Valencia in 1995. I have done research stays at the University of California San Diego and Michigan State University. After coming back I joined the Department of Genetics at the University of Valencia,  I am a Research Professor at CSIC in the IBMCP and I am also at the Santa Fe Institute (New Mexico, USA).   My research focuses on the study of the mechanisms that generate and maintain the great genetic diversity of microorganisms and more specific RNA viruses. For this, I use the theoretical framework provided for population genetics and experimental methodology of molecular Virology.
Jesús Picó
I am a control engineer fascinated with the world of systems and synthetic biology.
I lead the group of Control of Complex Systems at the Universitat Politècnica de València, where I am Professor of Automatic Control. Our main interests are     in robust possibilistic estimation of metabolic fluxes, possibilistic flux balance analysis, nonlinear feedback control techniques applied to synthetic biology,     and nonlinear distributed feedback control applied to coordination of multi-cellular systems.
