We carried out three different experiments changing the carbon source, to see its influence.  First we used glucose (1) as the only carbon source. Then we added galactose (2) as an extra carbon source. Finally we put sodium acetate (3) as an extra carbon source instead of galactose.
The use of alternatives to glucose is explained because  in previous tests we observed that low concentrations of glucose compromised cell growth.
With the experimental data we fitted the following repressible Hill-like function.
</P><P>And we estimated the following parameters for the 3 different conditions.
</P><P>In figures 1, 2 and 3 we plot the models and experimental data for the three experiments with glucose (1), added galactose (2) and added sodium acetate (3) respectively. IPTG was added to all the experiments to induce expression.

From here we can hypothesize that having another source of carbon  makes the promoter more sensitive to changes in the glucose concentration, as the slope of the Hill function gets larger. Also the constant K decreases, which tell us that less glucose is necessary to de-activate the promoter when there is another carbon source.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Are_you_hot.3F"><B>Are you hot?</B></SPAN></H3><P>When analyzing the Heat Shock promoter, we decided to model the static transfer function of the Fluorescent Intensity as a result of the Temperature following the Hill-like equation:
</P><P>In order to estimate the parameters of this model we performed a heat shock experiment.
</P><P>Our first analysis corresponds to a heat shock applied during 10 minutes at different temperatures, ranging from 20ºC to 51ºC. For each temperature three samples were tested. Fluorescence Intensity (FI) and optical density (OD) were measured at t<SUB>1</SUB>=60 min and t<SUB>2</SUB>=120 min after the application of the heat pulse had finished. 
</P><P> 
The first practical problem we encountered was the lack of enough heating coats. To try to solve it we took the culture and we split the experiments in two batches. FI and OD were measured at t<SUB>1</SUB>=60 min, and t<SUB>2</SUB>=120 min for batch number 1, while for batch number 2 the heat shock was delayed 40 min with respect to the first batch. Therefore, measurements for batch no.2 were taken at t<SUB>1</SUB>=100 min, and t<SUB>2</SUB>=160 min respectively.
</P><P>During the 40 min delay, the microorganism was growing. Therefore, the heat shock in batch no. 2 was applied to a larger population than in the case of batch no.1. Consequently, the measurements of FI and DO gave much higher values. This fact affects the ratio FI/DO, were the two batches can be clearly distinguished (see figure 4). 
</P><TABLE border="0.01" style="background-color:transparent" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD width="600" align="justify"><B>Figure 4.</B> Raw data from the heat shock experiment.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Our first modeling work was aimed to obtain data reconciliation. To this point,  we assumed that, during this 40 min delay, the only thing that happened was that cells grew. Growth was approximately linear in the range analyzed, as seen in figure 1 (blue data). We fitted a simple model DO=p1+p2*t. The result can be seen in figure 5, were:
	p1 = 0.161573
	p2 = 0.000866314
Therefore, the above ratio FI/DO can be compensated by multiplying data by the fractions (p1+p2*t100)/(p1+p2*t), and (p1+p2*t160)/(p1+p2*t). Actually, what we did was to compensate all measurements to the same time base. The reconciled results can be seen in figure 6.

Once we had all data reconciled, we fitted them to a static model relating the ratio between fluorescence intensity (FI) and the culture optical density (OD) with the temperature applied during the heat shock.
</P><P>Since the model is nonlinear with respect to parameters K<SUB>1</SUB> and n, we applied a global optimization algorithm based on stochastic search. Actually we applied it to fit the data at t=60 min, and t=120 min independently. The estimated parameters were:
</P><P>The results can be seen in figures 7 (t<SUB>60</SUB>), and 8 (t<SUB>120</SUB>) respectively.

</P><P>
One  question of interest is whether  the increment observed in the ratio IF/OD is caused by an incement of fluorescence during the time elapsed, or it is caused by a varying dilution effect due to a decrease in the specific groth rate during that period [1].
</P><P>
To answer this question notice that the absolute growth rate can be obtained from the regression model OD(t)= p1+p2*t obtained above. Notice t is expressed in minutes in our model. Indeed, the specific growth rate at time instant t can be roughly estimated as mu(t)= [dOD(t)/dt]/OD(t). This gives mu(t) = p2*60/(p1+p2*t) if mu(t) expressed in h^(-1). 
</P><P>
Therefore, we took our models and weighted them by mu(t60) and mu(t120) respectively. The result can be seen in figure 6. Indeed, the increment observed in fluorescence from t=60 to t=120 minutes could have been caused by a dillution effect. Of course, the main point to keep is that the ratio IF/OD (or, alternatively IF/OD*mu(t)) increases with temperature. So...our construction works!
