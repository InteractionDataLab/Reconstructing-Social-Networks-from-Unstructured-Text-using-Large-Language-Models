It is based on <B>Markov's interpretation</B> of hidden models. It's opensource and distributed with a <I>BSD licence</I>. Its main platfomorm is <B>Linux</B> and other <B>Unix systems</B>, but it also works in <B>Windows</B>.  It has been developed as a part of a free software kit for research in large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition (<I>LVCSR</I>) from 1977, and the Kyoto University of Japan has continued the work from 1999 to 2003.
</P><P>In order to use <B>Julius</B>, it is necessary to create a language model and an acoustic model.  Julius adopts the acoustic models and the pronunctiation dictionaries from the <I>HTK software</I>, which is not opensource, but can be used and downloaded for its use and posterior generation of acoustic models.   
<B> Acoustic model </B></P><P>An acoustic model is a file which contains an statistical representation of each of the different sounds that form a word (phoneme).  Julius allows voice recognition through continuous dictation or by using a previously introduced grammar.  However, the use of continuous dictation carries a problem.  It requires an acoustic model trained with lots of voice files. As the amount of sound files containing voices and different texts increases, the ratio of good hits of the acoustic model will improve.  This implies several variations: the pronunciation of the person training the model, the dialect used, etc. Nowadays, Julius doesn't count with any model good enough for continuous dictation in English.
</P><P>Due to the different problems presented by this kind of recognition, we chose the second option.  We designed a grammar using the Voxforce acoustic model based in Markov's Hidden Models.
To do this, we need the following file: 
-file .dict:a list of all the words that we want our culture to recognize and its corresponding decomposition into phonemes.
</P><UL><LI><B>Acoustic Analysis</B>
               Acoustic models take the acoustic properties of the input signal.  They acquire a group of vectors of certain characteristics that will later be compared with a group of 
               patterns that represent symbols of a phonetic alphabet and return the symbols which resembles them the most. This is the basis of the mathematical probabilistic 
               process called Hidden Markov Model.  The acoustic analysis is based on the extraction of a vector similar to the input acoustic signal with the purpose of applying the 
               theory of pattern recognition.

              This vector is a parametric representation of the acoustic signal, containing the most relevant information and storing as compressed as possible.
              In order to obtain a good group of vectors, the signal is pre-processed, reducing background noise and correlation.
              </LI><LI><B>HMM, Hidden Markov Model</B><B>Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)</B> provide a simple and effective framework
                for modelling time-varying spectral vector sequences. As a consequence,
                almost all present day large vocabulary continuous speech
                recognition systems are based on <B>HMMs</B>.
                
                The core of all speech recognition systems consists of a set
                of statistical models representing the various sounds of the language to
                be recognised. Since speech has temporal structure and can be encoded
                as a sequence of spectral vectors spanning the audio frequency range,
                the hidden <B>Markov model (HMM)</B> provides a natural framework for
                constructing such models.
                
                Basically, the input audio waveform from
                a microphone is converted into a sequence of fixed size acoustic vectors
                <I>Y[1:T] = y1, . . . ,yT</I> in a process called feature extraction. The decoder
                then attempts to find the sequence of words <I>w'[1:L] = w1,...,wL</I> which
                is most likely to have generated <I>Y</I> , i.e. the decoder tries to find.<I> w' = argmax{P(w|Y)}</I> for all the words w considered

                operating this (<B>Bayes rule</B>) the likelihood <I>p(Y|w)</I> is determined by the 
                acoustic model and the prior <I>P(w)</I> is determined by the language model.
             </LI></UL><P><B>Language model</B></P><P>Language model refers to the grammar on which the recognizer will work and specify the phrases that it will be able to identify.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Fluorimeter"><B>Fluorimeter</B></SPAN></H3><P>
A fluorimeter is an electronic device that can read the light and transform it in an electrical signal. In our project, that light proceeds from a bacterial culture that has been excited.
</P><P>
Its principle of operation is as follows:
</P><P>First, an electrical signal is sent from <B>Arduino</B> to a LED to activate it. This LED has a specific wavelength to excite the fluorescent protein present in the microbial culture. 
</P><P>
When these bacteria are shining, we receive that light intensity with a photodiode, and transform it into electrical current. Now, we have an electrical current that is proportional with the light and therefor to the concentration of fluorescent protein present in the culture. We have to be careful with the orientation between the LED and the photodiode because interferences may occur in the measurement due to light received by photodiode but not emitted by the fluorescence in the culture but scattered light emitted by the LED.  Also, a proper band-pass filter has been placed between culture and photodiode to allow only the desired wavelengths to pass through.
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="floatnone"><A href="/File:Fluorimetro1.gif" title="File:Fluorimetro1.gif">File:Fluorimetro1.gif</A></DIV></DIV><P>
The electric current coming from the photodiode has a very small amplitude, thereby we have to amplify it and translate it into a electric voltage with an electronic trans-impedance amplifier. We can choose the gain of this amplification changing the value of resistances of the circuit. The resistances must be properly chosen to select the desired amplification gain. Excessive amplification will not only amplify the signal but also amplify the noise, which is no desired in the measurement. </P><P>
Finally, the output voltage is sent to <B>Arduino</B>, and it will translate that in a digital signal.</P><P>
The original idea was taken from <I>[1]</I>.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Light_Mediated_Translator_.28LMT.29"><B>Light Mediated Translator (LMT)</B></SPAN></H3><DIV id="PorDefecto"><P><TABLE style="background-color:transparent"><TBODY><TR><TD width="300" align="justify">As a final step, we are working in the design of a <I>humanoid chassis</I> that will friendly mediate the communication between humans and microorganisms.
