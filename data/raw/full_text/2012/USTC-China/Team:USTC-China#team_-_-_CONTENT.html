I am applying this strategy on the mechanism of the complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. My ongoing project is to identify biomarkers in order to detect the progress stages of the diabetes. As a metabolic disease, diabetes-related proteins tend to enter the circulation system, thus the biomarker discovery in plasma has the potential to play an important role in the early detection and treatment of diabetes. We have developed systematic approaches based on proteomics and bioinformatics to analyze human normal and diabetic serum. In addition, I have planed to analyze the genetic and environmental factors and their interactions during the progressing of the type 2 diabetes with systems-biology approaches.</H3></DIV></LI><H1 class="ins">INSTRUCTORS</H1><LI class="page p3"><A href="#nogo" class="menuitem"><I>Hong Jiong</I></A><DIV><H2>Hong Jiong</H2><H3>Mail: hjiong@ustc.edu.cn</H3></DIV></LI><LI class="page p4"><A href="#nogo" class="menuitem"><I>Zhaofeng Luo</I></A><DIV><H2>Zhaofeng Luo</H2><H3>Mail: lzf@ustc.edu.cn</H3></DIV></LI><H1 class="stu">STUDENTS</H1><LI class="page p5"><A href="#nogo" class="menuitem"><I>Wuyang Chen</I></A><DIV><H2>Wuyang Chen</H2><H3>
Hello everyone, I'm Wuyang Chen, a junior student majoring in Life Science. I live in a pleasant city on a bank of Yangtze River. My parents plant many beautiful plants and feed a dog, two turtles and 20 or so pigeons in our house, which cultivated my passion for biology. I'm so thankful for my parents!
I think it is a brilliant idea to combine computer modeling and biology, which can help people predict a behavior of a system and test it by advanced biotechnology. So I join iGEM, to take part into the research of synthetic biology in person and realize some interesting projects. The past year in iGEM would be a meaningful and fantastic journey to me!
When taking a rest, I would like to tennis and listen to music. I love the music from the Secret Garden and the talent musician Jeo Hisaishi best!</H3></DIV></LI><LI class="page p6"><A href="#nogo" class="menuitem"><I>Xinzhe Li</I></A><DIV><H2>Xinzhe Li</H2><H3>Xinzhe Li is a junior majoring in life science in USTC.

At the period of my time in laboratory, I have learnt a lot of valuable spirits, such as teamwork, patience and insistence. 
　As a sophomore student, I am not familiar with scientific research. In retrospect, I find myself standing on a solid basis in both theory and experience. But things turn better after I join iGEM. It is not only a interesting competition, but also a useful method making me realize the secret of synthetic biology. I like it very much~</H3></DIV></LI><LI class="page p12"><A href="#nogo" class="menuitem"><I>Ting Fu</I></A><DIV><H2>Ting Fu</H2><H3>Hi! I am a junior student majoring in Biology at University of science and technology of China. Being a member of the USTC iGEM2012, I have learned a lot during this summer. It attracts me into the world of synthetic biology. Besides, I pick up some html&amp;css language and construct my first website--our wiki! That is a process where I make every efforts to rise to the challenge. What's more, iGEM has taught me how to cooperate with others. Without those discussions with my partners, I can hardly achieve what I have done. I feel so lucky here and would like to say that IGEM is the coolest game I have ever played! </H3></DIV></LI><LI class="page p13"><A href="#nogo" class="menuitem"><I>Xingwen Chen</I></A><DIV><H2>Xingwen Chen</H2><H3>
This guy is Xingwen Chen,a rising Junior majoring in Life Science.
The boy started his erupting interest on all kinds of creatures since his childhood. He luckily spent a lot of childhood in the countryside. Catching insects and picking wild potherbs were his favorite. And his dream was an entomologist.
Soon, the naughty kid learned about cell, gene and protein. And he knew Darwin, Mendel and Watson. He found something more attracting than insects.No one could change his passion on biology then. And his dreame was obviously a biologist.
Now, in college, the ignorant guy amazingly found his eyesight too narrow before. In fact, what he can see in the universe of life science is just a drop in a ocean. He had to choose one particular drop even though he didn't want to leave any drop. It was at that time that he noticed synthetic biology. And then came iGEM.
The 'crazy' guy loves and enjoys designing. In winter, brainstorming really excited him and he felt inspiration erupting. And this summer, he did a lot experiment to verify their thoughts. Finally, he could skillfully complete all the experiments they needed. Besides, analyzing result and puttting forward hypothesis was his another enjoyment. What's more, he learned how to manage his time!
In the future, we have reasons to expect the guy to stand on the stage of the world.

My research interests span antineoplastic and Brain-computer interface, but I am also interested in the synthetic biology. For, one day, it may play an important role in making the antineoplastic. And we can use some engineered bacteria to kill the cancer cell or induce the cancer cell to become a normal cell. What interests me more is that iGEM can make me consider a lot about the project and practice the ability to solve the problem by myself. I like to discuss academic topic with others. During our experiment there will be lots of new problems, and then we can try our best to overcome these difficulties. It’s a challenge and we can learn a lot from these challenges, and I take delight in overcoming these difficulties. After USTC, I want to pursue Ph.D in the aspect of antineoplastic or Brain-computer interface, for making more contributions to human beings.</H3></DIV></LI><LI class="page p15"><A href="#nogo" class="menuitem"><I>Jiawei He</I></A><DIV><H2>Jiawei He</H2><H3>    Hi!

I am especially interested in condensed matter theory. However, iGEM provided me with an opportunity to put what I learned into practice.

Biology is one of my interests since my childhood. With the hope to see how much the frontier biology research differs from my childhood dream, I joined iGEM team last year. During this year, I equipped myself with enough biology knowledge, especially in synthetic biology, which in my mind is quite an interesting and promising area that scientists designed, modeled and set up biological functional parts to solve real problems and to perform basic scientific research as well.

I treasure a lot the time I worked with my teammates together during the summer. In our project, I designed a computation model based on my knowledge learned in computational physics class. What is more, with the help from biology department students, I set up ODEs to describe our system. It is exciting to see how effective these two 'weapons' works!

Beyond academic activity, I am an easygoing boy interested in painting, chess, movie, traveling bicycling, plants and animals and so on. I am glad to be your friends!

In the laboratory, as a fresh man, my experiment skill is not as good as other senior students. So I always play a helper or a cooperator. in addition, I also do some work during the human practice part.
I really think our iGEM team is a good one. I learn a lot in the team, not only in experiment skill and knowledge of synthetic biology ,but also in cooperate skill and communicate skill. In the end ,I really appreciate ustc iGEM team to give me a chance to take part in this team.

My major is life science. 
I am an assistant of all the other guys in my team, in other word, my duty is to keep every fellows feel more comfortable and convenient while they are doing their work .
Certainly I have many other work to do, helping figure out the main direction of our theme, combining some bioparts together and doing some survey during the human practice part . 
For I have a strong ability of communicating and cooperating, everybody loves me , in my view .
Personally speaking, iGEM just establishes a board for many biology nuts from every parts of the world, it is meaningful for the mixing of science and interest. 
Though I am not the main force of our team, but things will get changed the next time of this game , I will come back for the honor of my university !
