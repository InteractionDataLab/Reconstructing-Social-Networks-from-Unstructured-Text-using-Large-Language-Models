plac promoter response to IPTG or Glucose
1. Streak a LB plate of the strain.
2. Inoculate two 3ml cultures of supplemented M9 Medium and antibiotic with single colony from the plate.

5. Stock concentration of the IPTG or glucose (the concentration of the both stock solution is 0.1 M) is diluted and added to different tubes to yield different final concentrations.To ensure the same response time , the IPTG or glucose should be added with a time interval of 2mins between tubes, so do the measurements procedure.

5. Add 2ml incubated culture into a small petri dish (diameter=6cm). Put the petri dish onto a magnetic stirrer under the preheated UV lamp. Irradiate for 1 min, open the cap of the petri dish, turn on the magnetic stirrer. After irradiating the dish for accurately 13s, turn off the UV lamp and the magnetic stirrer. Add 2ml double LB liquid media and incubate it without being exposed to light at 37℃ for 2h.

Lambda phage infecting assay
1. Inoculate 4ml LB liquid medium in a 30ml test tube with a strain you want to test. Incubate the bacteria on a shaking table at 37℃ for 16~20h.
2. Inoculate 4ml LB liquid medium in a 30ml test tube with 0.5ml overnight incubated bacteria mentioned above and incubate it on a shaking table at 37℃ for 4~6h.
3. Prepare the sterilized LB solid media (in which the agar A is only 0.7% (W/V)) and keep it as liquid in a water thermostat at 48℃. Add 0.5ml incubated bacteria mentioned above and lambda phage lysate (the volume is depend on the concentration you want to dilute to). Mix the media thoroughly and pour it onto a standard LB solid media (in which the agar A is 1.5% (W/V)). Be careful to make the newly poured layer of media as smooth as possible.
4. Incubate the media at 37℃ for 12~16h after the upper layer of media is solidified. Observe the media and count the number of plaque.
