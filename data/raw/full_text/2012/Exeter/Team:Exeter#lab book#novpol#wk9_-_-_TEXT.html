Transformations
Our own competent cells were removed from freezer, -80°C.
1. 5μl of DNA from each sample, Tetr_RBS + Cyc _Term & Has_Term and OmpA + SacB_Term added to 50μl of competent cells. The reason for using the entire quantity of competent cells was because they were believed to be less efficient than TOP10.
2. Kept on ice for 30 minutes. Whilst heat bath equilibrates to 42°C.
3.20pm
3. Heat shocked cells – transferred to water bath 42°C for 30 seconds exactly.
4. Moved straight back into ice for ~2 minutes.
5. Aseptically added 700μl of room temperature LG medium to each eppendorf.
3.30pm
6. Incubated all samples in the shaker at 37°C, 250 rpm for 1 hour.
7. Span samples at 3000G for 5 minutes.
Plates labelled:
Tetr_RBS + cyc_Term
Tetr_RBS + HAS_Term
OmpA + SacB_Term
Aseptically discarded 600μl solution from each eppendorf. Pipette mixed remaining and spread over plates.
5.05pm
Plates in incubator, 37°C overnight.
**Tuesday 04/09/12**
9.00am
Checked plates. Colonies have formed on all. Our own competent cells appear to be more efficient than first expected, less should be spread on future plates to make single colonies easier to pick.
These were all placed in the fridge, 4°C.
3.25pm
Plates out of fridge, ready to transfer liquid broth.
4x made per plate – aseptic technique
Used 10ml broth
10μl Kanamycin
Scraped off single colony using pipette tip which was then ejected into liquid broth.
Tetr_RBS + HAS_Term and OmpA + SacB_Term had red and white colonies on the plates. Only the white colonies were selected.
4.20pm
Put into horizontal shaker set at 37°C, 220rpm – left overnight.
**Wednesday 05/09/12**
9.00am
Liquid broth aseptically transferred to new falcon tubes – leaving pipette tip behind.
10.00am
These were then centrifuged at 3900rpg for 10 minutes, 4°C.
The same protocol was followed as in the previous week for Mini prep . However 40μl of clean water was added, instead of the previous 50μl, to boost the concentration of DNA in each sample.
