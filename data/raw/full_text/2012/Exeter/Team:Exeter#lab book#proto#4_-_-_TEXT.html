Digest the Destination Plasmid with EcoR1-HF and Pst1: The Destination Plasmid DNA should either be prepared with PCR or contain a toxic gene (e.g. ccdb, sacB) in the cloning     site to avoid the need for gel purification. The Destination Plasmid should also have a different antibiotic resistance marker from both the plasmid containing the Upstream Part     and the plasmid containing the Downstream Part to avoid the need to purify the Upstream and Downstream Parts.
