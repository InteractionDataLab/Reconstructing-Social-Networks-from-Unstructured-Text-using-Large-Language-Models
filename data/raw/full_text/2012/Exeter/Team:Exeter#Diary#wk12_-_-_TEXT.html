WEEK TWELVE
3rd-7th September 2012
Our numbers were back up to 5 in the lab with the return of James. Both he and Ryan had offered up their time, away from the wiki, for just 3 more days before they refuse to step foot back into the wetlab.
It was another manic week, in which Freddie decided he wanted us to attempt a 100 mini-prep marathon! An incredibly busy day which was nonetheless quite amazing! One of the most important things we had to keep on top of for the day was making sure everything was labelled correctly!
The following day this naturally led us to making the largest gel we’d ever run!
With two thirds of the wiki team leaving the labs, a meeting was called to discuss the finalised structure for the website. A new home page was discussed with the intention for the entire site to tell a story, allowing the user to easily navigate through all pages.
...
The deadlines are fast approaching and the wiki team have been staying up later and later to complete the site. On the final day they were each logged in putting the finishing touches to every aspect of the wiki.
We would like to take a fleeting moment to give our thanks to Tom Howard and everyone who has given their time to help over the course of this project. We would also like to thank the iGEM competition as a whole for providing us with this fantastic opportunity. We have all had an incredibly interesting, hard working but fun experience this year.
On the 27th September at 3am GMT, we declared the website complete.
