Collaborators
The University of Exeter 2012 iGEM Team wishes thank and acknowledge the support and input of the many people without whom this project would not have been possible.
Hover over their images to read their individual contributions and follow the links to their official pages to find out more about them.
All wet lab work for this project was performed by the iGEM undergraduate team. Please see the relevant labbooks for a description of the work undertaken.
From the University of Exeter: Department of Biosciences
Dr. Nicholas Harmer
Doctor Harmer helped to plant the seed of an idea for this project at the very beginning of our iGEM experience. He has been an invaluable font of help and support throughout the project, and has given time to present a seminar of polysaccharides.
Dr. Nicholas Harmer
Prof. John Love
We are very grateful to Professor Love, who has kindly given over the resources and work space of his lab this summer along with an allocation of his research budget, for the team to conduct the wet-lab elements of the project. He has made himself available for advice throughout the project, and given time to present a seminar on synthetic biology.
Prof. John Love
Prof. Steve Aves
We are very grateful to Professor Aves, who has kindly given over the resources and work space of his lab this summer for the team to conduct the wet-lab elements of the project. He has made himself available for advice throughout the project.
Prof. Steve Aves
Prof. Robert Beardmore
We are very grateful to Professor Beardmore for his guidance with our programming and mathematical modelling, directly and through his post-doc, Rafael Pena Miller and particularly for his generous gift of £5,000 via his research group, Theoretical and Computational Biosciences, which has helped to fund this year's iGEM team.
Prof. Robert Beardmore
Prof. Murray Grant
We are very grateful to Professor Grant for his very generous financial contribution this summer, helping us to fund the project.

Prof. Ken Haynes
We are very grateful to Professor Haynes for his very generous financial contribution this summer, helping us to fund the project.
Prof. Ken Haynes
Prof. Nicholas Smirnoff
We are very grateful to Professor Smirnoff, who has kindly given over the resources and work space of his lab this summer for the team to conduct the wet-lab elements of the project. He has made himself available for advice throughout the project, and given time to present a seminar on metabolic engineering.
Prof. Nicholas Smirnoff
Dr. George Littlejohn
We are very grateful to Doctor Littlejohn for his helpful input and support in labs at different stages throughout the project. We are equally grateful for his introducing the team to his wife Marian, who was our artistic image consultant at the beginning of the project.
Dr. George Littlejohn
Dr. Michael Page
We are very grateful to Doctor Page for his helpful input at different stages across the project.
Dr. Michael Page
Dagmara Kolak
The Team would like to thank Dagmara for all her help within the lab this summer, from providing the safety talks, to guiding everyone through the correct use of lab equipment, and most of all for being on hand to fix things when something went wrong!
Dagmara Kolak
Dr. Hannah Florance
We would like to acknowledge the assistance and advice rendered to us by Doctor Florance with Mass Spectrometry.
Dr. Hannah Florance
Dr. Mark Wood
We would like to acknowledge the assistance and advice rendered to us by Doctor Wood with Chemical Synthesis.
Dr. Mark Wood
Dr. Sara Burton
We would like to thank Doctor Burton for the time spent with us at the beginning of the project introducing the advanced laboratory skills to those who have not (and reminding those who had) been initiated in the arts of practical biology. We'd like to ackowledge her helpful advice throughout the project as well.
Dr. Sara Burton
Dr. Mark Ramsdale
We would like to thank Doctor Ramsdale for the time spent with us at the beginning of the project introducing the general laboratory skills to those who have not (and reminding those who had) been initiated in the arts of practical biology.
Dr. Mark Ramsdale
Ed Creed
Ed Creed was our primary contact for advertising the Exeter iGEM project to the wider University via the many associated web outlets.

Prof. C Peter Winlove (Physics)
Professor Winlove has been a fierce proponent of Exeter's first ever entry into the iGEM competition. He has helped us develop the foundational purpose of the project, sharing insights into the physical structure and properties of polysaccharides (a personal interest) allowing us to realise the possible future applications of our system output.
Prof. C Peter Winlove
Dr. John Rowe (Physics)
Doctor Rowe was instrumental in the early stages of the GlycoWeb build, helping Liam get to grips with the Python programming language and making himself available for any subsequent queries as the project advanced.
Dr. John Rowe
Dr. Peter Petrov (Physics)
We'd like to thank Doctor Petrov for his seminar on Biological Nanomotors during the training weeks of the project, it gave us many ideas and really enticed us into thinking about the possibilities of the our iGEM project-to-be.
Dr. Peter Petrov
Dr. Orkun Soyer (Mathematics)
Doctor Soyer enthused our Mathematician Andy into creadting a model that could be created to optimise our biosynthetic system, and made himself available for advice and guidance throughout this period of the project.
Dr. Orkun Soyer
From the ESRC Centre for Genomics in Society (EGENIS) @ the University of Exeter
Prof. Steve Hughes
Professor Hughes provided us with methods of team planning and organisation, and has been an invaluable source of information and support throughout the project. He also chaired and organised for, our presentation at Cafe Scientifique Exeter.
Prof. Steve Hughes
Dr. Sabina Leonelli
Doctor Leonelli provided support for our review of Human Practices with regard to the project.
Dr. Sabina Leonelli
From the Greenpeace Research Laboratories @ the University of Exeter
David Santillo
Mr Santillo helped us to consider the wider human practice and safety issues connected with our project and was instrumental in helping us fit the project within these guidelines.

From Research and Knowledge Transfer @ the University of Exeter
Dr. Matthew Baker
Doctor Baker delved into the the wider impact that the project could have, introducing us to the idea of Intellectual Property and the associated legal connotations. We enthusiastically broached the subject of why and how a business could be created out of our work and discussed the hurdles associated with such a development.
Dr. Matthew Baker
Dr. Teresa Penfield
Doctor Penfield also helped delve into the the wider impact that the project could have, introducing us to the idea of Intellectual Property and the associated legal connotations. We enthusiastically broached the subject of why and how a business could be created out of our work and discussed the hurdles associated with such a development.
Dr. Teresa Penfield
Mark Kelly
As with Doctors Baker and Penfield, Mr Kelly helped us to consider the future impact of the work that we had undertaken, explaining in depth the procedures that would have to be followed to identify the potential of the project and purpose in creating a business out of the idea.

Marian Littlejohn
Mrs Littlejohn was our artistic image consultant. She helped us early on in the project, guiding us towards producing a professional image in the manner of our information outlets. This involved the crafting of an impacting project title and in particular, a logo from which we would draw our visual themes for the rest of our time on the project.
