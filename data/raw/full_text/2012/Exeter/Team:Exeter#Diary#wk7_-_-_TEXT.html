WEEK SEVEN
30th July-3rd August 2012
The previous week saw the birth of the GlycoWeb project in the python development platform.  This means that having made a python program, complete with tk interface, which is capable of returning the expression enzymes for a saccharide chain of arbitrary length, we are now at the development stage where the program is ready to be launched as a website.  Unfortunately, this makes much of the tk interface design work redundant.
This has involved learning how to use the ‘bottle’ module, the lightweight WSGI micro web-framework for Python. At this stage it appears that most of the code used in tk interface program is applicable to the web-framework.
Towards the end of the week it became apparent that in order to decorate the web-page, knowledge of html would be required.  This we believe will provide an opportunity to exercise the skills and knowledge obtained by the team when developing the wiki!
James has been busy in the library this week watching plenty of tutorial videos on writing ‘apps’. He’s hoping to make an app which can utilise the glycobase. He’s also been pondering the possibility of creating a top trumps style game!
Alex B, Andy and Becca hosted The human practice panel. It went well with plenty of probing questions for our team and the project. Please find out more here
