WEEK NINE
13th-17th August 2012
Ryan has returned from his antics of obsessing over the Olympics for the past three weeks and is ready to make up on lost time by resizing our wiki to a size which suits all! It first came to our attention around the same time we discovered the text was not in fact universal and ‘web safe’. (We thought we'd save it for him.. actually he volunteered!)
Everyone is busy preparing for the UK team meet up happening in London at the Google Campus (thanks to NRP-UEA iGEM for organising). It will comprise of keynote speakers and general mingling before getting to the nitty-gritty of giving our current presentations of our progress so far. We see this as a great opportunity to not only meet fellow like minded iGEM’ers but also an excellent chance to practice portraying our project to a larger scientific audience.
We had a successful practice Tuesday morning in front of the normal group and extended team and our core presenters have been chosen. Wednesday saw the presentation being given to several academics, giving us the chance to test out our question and answers capabilities. Congratulations to Freddie, Becca, and Andy who are relishing the prospect of giving several important talks!
