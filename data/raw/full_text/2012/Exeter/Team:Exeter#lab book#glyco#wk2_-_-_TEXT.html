Python features a dynamic typing module, so a variable 'x' can change from int to string or list in a line of code. Python has control statements: 1) Pass 2) Control 3) Break #continue statement passes control to next do, for or while statement in which it appears.  #break statement terminates execution of nearest enclosing for/while statement. #pass is a null operation.
Python 2.7 online tutorial
Boolean variables and number variables can be imported using 'import math'. Worked with strings and implemented switch statement. Demonstrated break and continue controls within code and printed to screen. Local and global variable differences studied with method to change global variables inside functions. Function created to accept an unlimited number of key-valued pairs. Recursion, or calling a function inside itself, demonstrated using factorial example.

Object orientated programming tutorials.
Attributes: Variables Functions: Methods
Studied classes, a blueprint for creating objects. Errors can be caught in Python. All built in errors in Python are contained in a directory. Viewed tutorials for database development with Python and Sqlite3, a built in module within the Python programming language.
