Human Practices Discussion
Dr David Parker from Shell first introduced us to the business      considerations of our project and helped to shape our thoughts on where our project could go in the business sector. We discussed product yields, as the more polysaccharide      produced the more money we could make. Organisms use most of the sugar for themselves and would only produce about 1% of our desired polysaccharide.  Bacteria are better as they     don’t have compartmentalisation, have faster growth and higher yield but how do you control their fermentation, considering antibiotics kill the host. We discussed alternative      methods of producing our polysaccharides including using the bacteria to instead produce the enzymes and isolating these.
David Parker also introduced us to marketing considerations, who our competitors would be and, since we don’t have any and are filling a niche, which would benefit from our      new technology.
David Ion from a local food manufacturer discussed with us the business applications of our products to their industry but      pointed out the current difficulties of introducing GM products into food products. Their interest was primarily in the cholesterol reducing properties of cyclodextrin and we      considered how it might be possible to treat their food ingredients and then remove cyclodextrin so a GM product wasn’t in their final merchandise. Unfortunately we are a long      way off of using our products in the food industry due to the restrictions to GM products and the barriers to any food ingredient from a food safety aspect.
Professor Rick Titball and Dr. Timothy Atkins from DSTL met and discussed the vaccine application to our project. The benefits to producing polysaccharide      vaccines includes a reduced immune response to the adjuvant and also we are not introducing attenuated or dead bacteria and so people are unlikely to become ill from taking the      vaccine but are still protected against the disease. This improves upon current vaccines and also provides the opportunity to treat a wider range of diseases and improve public      health.
The meeting with DSTL led us to a discussion with Dr. Andrew Watts, head of Glythera , who      pointed out a technology in development that could improve upon our polysaccharide vaccines by binding to a protein they are developing that increases B cell activation 10,000      fold. This would improve the efficacy of our vaccines. He also pointed out to us that even though there weren’t enough promoters for the control of all our glycosyltranferases,      there is the opportunity of producing NOT and NOR gates to introduce more variability to expression or potential to look at more downstream expression effectors such as protein      modifications.
Our regular meetings with Dr. Sabina Leonelli also highlighted the      ethical issues surrounding our iGEM project. Specifically, questions over data mis-use of our technology versus open source ethos of iGEM were raised as well as ethical issues      over human intervention of natural life-forms such as E.coli that we are using to build our technology.
Frequent meetings with Greenpeace with Dr. David Santillo and Dr. Janet Cotter allowed us to adjust our project to minimise      environmental risks if our GMO and/or high-quality polysaccharide products were to be released into the environment. These issues were implemented both throughout this project      and beyond the iGEM competition.
The combination of discussions with professionals of their fields, the human practice panel held early on in our project and the continued development of our project      alongside human practice considerations has enabled us to consider all aspects of human practices concerned with our project. We have been able to develop human practices      alongside our project so they evolved together.
