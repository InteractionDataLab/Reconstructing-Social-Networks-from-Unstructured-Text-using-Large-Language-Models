GlycoBase/GlycoWeb: 16th - 20th July 2012
17/07/2012
Created database design 1, including file tab for quitting the application and help tab. Prompt for typing the name of sugar the user wishes to add to the chain and 'get enzymes' button to complete action and return the enzymes required to make the polysaccharide.
A submit enzyme button will also be required for the user to have interaction with the database.
Version completed by adding a reset button.

Dry lab meeting for next database design
To do list:
- Make Python export to HTML, which can then be interpreted by a browser.
- Incorporate 'random button'. The user inputs the length of the repeat unit and a random chain is then created with the enzyme list.
- Link to literature: Has this polysaccharide been mentioned?
- Get the database on the web.
- Use SQL to find all possible connections.
- Arrange meeting with John Rowe.
