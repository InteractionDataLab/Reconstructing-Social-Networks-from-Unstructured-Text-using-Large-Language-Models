Linearized Plasmid Backbone Digestion and Ligation Protocol
For digestion of the linearized plasmid backbone, make an enzyme master-mix of:
5 µL NEB Buffer 2
0.5 µL BSA
0.5 µL EcoRI-HF
0.5 µL PstI
18.5 µL dH20
Then add 4µL of linearized plasmid backbone (25ng/µL for 100ng total) into 4µL of enzyme master mix.
Digest for 37C/30 min and then heat kill at 80C/20 min.
Once heat killed, a ligation mix is made-up containing:
2µl of digested plasmid backbone (25ng)
Equimolar amount of EcoRI-HF SpeI digested fragment (< 3 µL)
Equimolar amount of XbaI PstI digested fragment (< 3 µL)
1 µL T4 DNA ligase buffer.
0.5 µL T4 DNA ligase
Top up solution to 10µL with water
Ligate at 16C/30 min and then heat kill at 80C for 20 min.
Transform with 1-2µL of product.
