e-candi: The Story   |   Results at a Glance   |   Build Your Own Polysaccharide
The iterative design cycle allows scientists and engineers to continually adapt and take advantage of         what has already been learnt. This project, e-candi, investigates whether synthetic biology can provide a platform technology to revolutionise polysaccharide research, allowing rapid biosynthesis of designer polysaccharides and the implementation of such a design cycle.
