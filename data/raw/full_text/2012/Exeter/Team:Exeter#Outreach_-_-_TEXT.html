Outreach
The ExiGEM 2012 Team believed it was important to encourage interest in Synthetic Biology and to create an awareness of what it is currently achieving.
Using iGEM as our springboard, we invited local A-Level students to participate in the project as short term members of the team, and held a synthetic biology workshop with      a wider audience of local sixth form students (age 16 to 18). To advertise our experience to an older audience, we presented our work at the Exeter Café Scientifique meeting where we      discussed, and were challenged, on the wider effects of our project and of synthetic biology as a whole.
