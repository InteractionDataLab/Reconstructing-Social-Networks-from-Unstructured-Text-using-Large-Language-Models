WEEK TEN
20th-24th August 2012
Last Friday was the Google Campus meetup for all UK iGEM teams – it was a great success! The talks were all really good, our three speakers were particularly dazzling, and all of the teams had brilliant ideas. Our networking with other teams was put to the test as we exchanged details and business cards with several iGEM’ers. The opportunity to both give and receive feedback on our projects with other teams was very insightful.
This experience set us up nicely to start our preparations in making the design to our final presentation, ready for the jamboree in Amsterdam!
This week our wetlab team is still trying to PCR wbbC out of the E. coli genome. So far it still hasn’t worked! However Christine assured us that sometimes only a one in a million dilution will work with DMSO to get the genomic DNA into a PCR-ing mood.
We will prevail!
We met with various business members including DSTL to discuss the impact our project would have on their company if our idea proceeded into the future.
Next week the physicists will be dragged into the labs whether they like it or not!
Alex Clowsley will be taking over the project, Showcasing Polysaccharides !
