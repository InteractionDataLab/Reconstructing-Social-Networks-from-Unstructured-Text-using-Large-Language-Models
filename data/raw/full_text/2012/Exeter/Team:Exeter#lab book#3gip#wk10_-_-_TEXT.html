Performed with the NEB protocol with some adaptations again. The volume of digestion was changed from 50μl to 20μl by adding less water so as to increase the DNA concentration. The enzymes and buffer concentrations were adapted as below. This was not a linearized plasmid backbone so for the plasmid digestion we used the NEB Biolabs protocol adapted to the amounts shown below.

Morning
• Transferring BioBricks into pSB1C3
wbnJ into pSB1C3
wbnK into pSB1C3
wfcA into pSB1C3
wbbC(1) into pSB1C3
wbbC(2) into pSB1C3

wclY into pSB1C3
wbiP into pSB1C3
wbiP into pSB1C3
The genes and the destination plasmid were cut using EcoR1 and PstI. The digest was incubated for 90 minutes and then deactivated by heating at 80°C for 20 minutes. The ligation was performed as per the 3A assembly above but 4µl of plasmid DNA was used to 2µl of destination plasmid.
Afternoon
• Transformation
The ligations above and the ligations from the 12/09/2012 were transformed using the Competent Cell protocol using our competent cells made in the lab.
Wednesday 12th September
Morning
wbbC(1) into pSB1C3, wbbC(2) into pSB1C3, wbbC(3) into pSB1C3 and wbiP into pSB1C3 did not form colonies on the plates. They were repeated.

• 3A Assembly
ompA + amyA BBa_B0014
Performed with the NEB protocol with some adaptations again. The volume of digestion was changed from 50μl to 20μl by adding less water so as to increase the DNA concentration. The enzymes and buffer concentrations were adapted as below. This was not a linearized plasmid backbone so for the plasmid digestion we used the NEB Biolabs protocol adapted to the amounts shown below.
• Two Step Phusion PCR using a 6 X 10 serial dilution
The reaction was set up using the Biolabs Phusion PCR protocol.
Two reactions were set up:
Reaction 1: Pbad Large and wbnJ using the primers supplied. See Operon Construction: 9th - 13th July 2012
Reaction 2: Reaction 1: Pbad Large and wbnJ using the primers supplied and varying the magnesium concentration. See Operon Construction: 9th - 13th July 2012
After PCR, PCR mix was dyed, loaded onto the gel and run for 20 minutes. No bands were shown on the gel so the PCR did not work.
Afternoon
• Transferring colonies to liquid medium
Cells transformed with below were added into liquid medium and incubated overnight.

Protocol was followed using chloramphenicol for the BioBrick part as the selection antibiotic.
Thursday 13th. September
Morning
ompA + amyA BBa_B0014 showed no colonies on the overnight plate.
• Miniprepping

All mini-preps were nanodropped showing very good concentrations.
Afternoon
•Gel Digest of DNA from 21/08/2012
A digestion using EcoR1 and PstI was run on all of the miniprepped DNA from today.
For the digestion we used Fermentas enzymes instead. The protocol remained the same but Fermentas Buffer H was used instead of the NEB Buffer 2.
Friday 14th September
Today a digestion/ligation was set up to put our remaining BioBricks into pSB1C3.

The genes and the destination plasmid were cut using EcoR1 and PstI. The digest was incubated for 90 minutes and then deactivated by heating at 80°C for 20 minutes. The ligation was performed as per the 3A assembly above but 4μl of plasmid DNA was used to 2μl of destination plasmid.
For the digestion we used Fermentas enzymes instead. The protocol remained the same but we used Fermentas Buffer H instead of the NEB Buffer 2.
There was not enough time to transform any of these this afternoon so after the ligation they were stored at -20°C for the weekend.
