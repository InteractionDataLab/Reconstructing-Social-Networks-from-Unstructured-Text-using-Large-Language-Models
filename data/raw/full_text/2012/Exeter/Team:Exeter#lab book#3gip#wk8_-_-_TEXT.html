The 3-Gene Inducible Plasmid: 27th - 31st August 2012
Tuesday 28th August
Morning
• 3A Assembly
BBa_B0034 + wbnJ in pSB1K3
BBa_B0034 + wbnK in pSB1K3
BBa_B0034 + wfcA in pSB1K3
BBa_B0034 + wbbC(1) in pSB1K3
BBa_B0034 + wbbC(2) in pSB1K3
BBa_B0034 + wbbC(3) in pSB1K3
BBa_B0034 + wclY in pSB1K3
BBa_B0034 + wbiP in pSB1C3
BBa_B0034 + wbiP in pSB1C3
Performed with the NEB protocol with some adaptations again. The volume of digestion was changed from 50µl to 20µl by adding less water so as to increase the DNA concentration. The enzymes and buffer concentrations were adapted as below.
Afternoon
• Transformation
Chloramphenicol plasmid backbone pSB1C3, 2012 Distribution Kit Plate 1 3A
Tetracycline plasmid backbone pSB1T3, 2012 Distribution Kit Plate 1 7A
Kanamycin plasmid backbone pSB1K3, 2012 Distribution Kit Plate 1 5A
Ampicillin plasmid backbone pSB1A3, 2012 Distribution Kit Plate 1 1G
Invitrogen TOP10 competent cells split were split between 2 eppendorfs for 2 x 25μl.
Spread on the relevant antibiotic plates for each transformation using 150μls.
Wednesday 29th August
Morning
•Gel Digest of DNA from 21/08/2012
Lanes 1, 2, 3, 4 ompA
Lanes 6, 7, 8, 9  BBa_J23119 + BBa_B0034 wbnJ
Lanes 10, 11 BBa_J13002 + wbnK BBa_B0014v
Planned another 3A assembly but had run out of plasmid backbone.
Afternoon
• Transferring colonies to liquid medium
Cells transformed with pSB1C3, pSB1T3, pSB1K3, pSB1A3 were added into liquid medium and incubated overnight.
Protocol was followed using the relevant antibiotic for the BioBrick part as the selection antibiotic.
Thursday 30th August
Morning
• Miniprepping of pSB1C3, pSB1T3, pSB1K3, pSB1A3
pSB1C3, pSB1T3, pSB1K3 and pSB1A3 were nanodropped and recorded very good concentrations.
Afternoon
• Transformation
The ligations were transformed using the Competent Cell protocol and using the competent cells made in the lab.
• Transferring colonies to liquid medium
Cells transformed with amyA in pSB1C3, hasA in pSB1C3, amyA + BBa_B0014 in pSB1C3, hasA + BBa_Boo14 in pSB1C3, sacB + BBa_Boo14 in pSB1C3 were added into liquid medium and incubated overnight. See Showcasing Polysaccharide Production: 27th - 31st August 2012, Thursday 30/08/12
Protocol was followed using chloramphenicol for the BioBrick part as the selection antibiotic.
Friday 31st August

BBa_B0034 wbbC obtained from PCR into pSB1C3
BBa_B0034 in pSB1A3
BBa_J13002 in pSB1A3
Performed with the NEB protocol with some adaptations again. The volume of digestion was changed from 50μl to 20μl by adding less water so as to increase the DNA concentration. The enzymes and buffer concentrations were adapted as below. This was not a linearized plasmid backbone so for the plasmid digestion we used the NEB Biolabs protocol adapted to the amounts shown below.
Afternoon
• Transformation
The ligated constructs were transformed using the Competent Cell protocol and using our competent cells made in the lab.
