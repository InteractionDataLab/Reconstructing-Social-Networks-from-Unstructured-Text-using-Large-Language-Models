Preparation of IDTE Buffer and IDT Re-Suspension
Spin down IDT synthesised gene for 10 seconds to ensure the DNA is at the bottom of the tube.
In a Duran bottle, add Tris (11.31g) to MilliQ H2O (40mL) and using a stir bar and magnetic stirrer, mix the solution thoroughly for 1 minute.
Add 1M NaOH drop-wise until all the Tris is dissolved and the pH reaches approximately pH 9.
Top up the solution to 50mL using MilliQ H2O to make a 10mM Tris solution and autoclave for 20 minutes.
In a separate Duran bottle, add EDTA (1.21g) to MilliQ H2O (60mL) and using a stir bar and magnetic stirrer, mix the solution thoroughly for 1 minute.
Add 1M HCl drop-wise until the pH drops to pH 7.5.
Top up the solution to 100mL using MilliQ H2O to make a 0.1mM EDTA solution, and then autoclave for 20 minutes.
Finally, add appropriate volumes of Tris and EDTA solutions to make a 50mL solution with 10mM Tris, 0.1mM EDTA. Use this final IDTE solution for re-suspension of      all synthesised genes.
Add 40µL of IDTE buffer to each synthesised gene, held between pH 7.5-8.0, to reach an approximate concentration of 50ng/µL stock solution.
Vortex for 20 seconds.
Leave to incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 16’100rcf.
To dilute each synthesised gene for transformation, add 2µL of the stock solution to 999µL MilliQ H2O to reach an approximate concentration of 0.1ng/µL.      Centrifuge briefly to spin down any liquid.
Use between 1-5µL of this diluted stock solution for transformation.
Store remaining hydrated DNA stock solution from the IDT re-suspension at -20°C until further use required.
