3-Step PCR
Make-up a 50µL total solution in a PCR tube of:
5µL of 10ng/µL genomic DNA template
1µL dNTPs
1µL Forward Primer (@100pmol/µL)
1µL Reverse Primer (@100pmol/µL)
10µL High-Fidelity Phusion 5x Buffer
1µL High-Fidelity Phusion polymerase
31µL MilliQ H2O
Run a three-step PCR experiment using the following settings:/p>
Stage 1: 98oC for 5 minutes for 1 cycle
Stage 2: 98oC for 30 seconds followed by 65oC for 20 seconds, followed by 72oC for 30 seconds, all for 30 cycles
Stage 3: 72oC for 5 minutes for 1 cycle
