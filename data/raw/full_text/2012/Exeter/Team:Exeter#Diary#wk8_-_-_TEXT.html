WEEK EIGHT
6th-10th August 2012
From the perspective of GlycoWeb the optimistic outlook was to finish the week with a working website, capable of accepting a user defined list of sugar units and returning the appropriate expression enzymes. There exists a small probability that the website may even be hosted on the University of Exeter server by the end of the month!
Our Biologists and work experience student Chris have been busy doing science in the laboratories.
It’s at the end of this week we’ve said good-bye to Liam as he jets off to study his 3rd year in America! Freddie baked a lovely repressilator cake, as seen below (it tasted amazing!) and also brought in lots of American candy including delightful Twinkies something which this poor physicist hadn’t seen the likes of for many a year!
Sadly we won’t see Liam now until Christmas, unless of course the team make it to MIT in November..
