Single Gene Plasmids and Enzyme Characterisation: 20th - 24th August 2012
Monday 20th August (11.00)
• 3A assembly of WbnJ-pSB1C3, WbnK-pSB1C3, WbbC(with point mutation)-pSB1C3, WfcA-pSB1C3, WclY-pSB1C3 and WbiP-pSB1C3
Tuesday 21st August (9.00)
• Transformation of WbnJ-pSB1C3, WbnK-pSB1C3, WbbC(with point mutation)-pSB1C3, WfcA-pSB1C3, WclY-pSB1C3 and WbiP-pSB1C3
Wednesday 22nd August (9.00)
• 3A assembly of WclY-pSB1C3 and WbiP-pSB1C3
• Adding cultures with ligated WbnJ-pSB1C3, WbnK-pSB1C3, WbbC(with point mutation)-pSB1C3 and WfcA-pSB1C3 as well as WbbC(with point mutation)-terminator into liquid medium overnight
No colonies with ligated WclY-pSB1C3 and WbiP-pSB1C3 were found and thus 3A assembly was repeated.
Thursday 23rd August (9.00)
• Adding cultures with ligated WbnJ-pSB1C3, WbnK-pSB1C3, WbbC(with point mutation)-pSB1C3 and WfcA-pSB1C3 as well as WbbC(with point mutation)-terminator into liquid medium overnight
• Transformation of WclY-pSB1C3 and WbiP-pSB1C3
The shaking incubator broke on Wednesday evening and therefore adding cultures into liquid medium was repeated.
