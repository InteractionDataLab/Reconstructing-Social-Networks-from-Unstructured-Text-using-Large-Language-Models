• Miniprepping
BBa_J13002 + wbnK BBa_B0014 in pSB1T3
wfcA + BBa_B0014 in pSB1T3
wbnJ + BBa_B0014 in pSB1T3
BBa_B0034 wbbC + BBa_B0014 in pSB1T3
Using the changed protocol. The tubes were centrifuged for 10 minutes to start to ensure a good pellet formed.
After the neutralisation solution had been added, the eppendorfs were centrifuged for 10 minutes rather than 5 in order to get a better pellet formation.
40ul of water was added instead of 50ul in order to make sure the concentration of DNA increased.
All were nanodropped and only wfcA + BBa_B0014 and wbnJ + BBa_B0014 gave good concentrations.
Wednesday 15th August – Friday 17th August
Preparation for presentation so no lab work.
