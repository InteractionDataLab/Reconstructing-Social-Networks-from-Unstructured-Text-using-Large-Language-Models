GlycoBase/GlycoWeb: 9th - 13th July 2012

Database:
1) Added a variable, failed to loop over items in queryCurs after search. If items are found in queryCurs the error message is printed to console.
2) Could put the whole program in an infinite loop so that the program asks for the next sugar sequence.
3) With regards to accepting an arbitrary number of 'sugars': - Append each user input to a list - User input: type q to quit infinite loop - Call the list 'sugars' and create the conn tuple (2 item) over the indices contained in sugars. - Run the query for each conn generated.
This will require progressive work
4) Create the database and save it to a file, so it is called each time rather than having to be created.
