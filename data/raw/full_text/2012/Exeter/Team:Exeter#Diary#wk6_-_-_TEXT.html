WEEK SIX
23rd-27th July 2012
Initially the entire wet lab team worked on bulking up our wbnJ and wfcA genes. They also did 3A assembly of some promoters to RBS sequences - this sadly didn't work.
However a persistent Mary and Freddie attempted the 3A assembly for a second time alongside the standard assembly. The resulting product was transformed and run on a gel. This gel disappointingly showed no fragments other than the plasmid after digestion, however transformation in antibiotic medium did work. This led to the realisation that the promoter biobricks were smaller than we had first believed and therefore wouldn’t appear clearly on the gel. The plasmid was sent off for sequencing and another gel run. This second gel showed two bands, consistent with what you would expect from the two biobricks together alongside the plasmid backbone. Hopefully our sequencing results will confirm it was indeed successful!
Our wiki team have all been coding using the Windows operating system (don't ask why) and so were shocked to discover that Macs were displaying an entirely different font to the one the team had chosen! Ryan had been convinced that our initial font was universal and 'web safe'.. it turns out not to have been the case! With the chief wiki coder away it fell to Alex to 'sort it out'.
And so it was, that this week would see all the pages change to endure the long lasting privilege of the 'Verdana' font type - which is definitely universal and 'web safe'!
This week the team has been busy preparing for a human practices presentation due to be given Friday 3rd August. In this talk we'll be tackling the key issues we identified revolving around the ethical, environmental, and potential business impacts our project may have. We have invited five professionals in their respective fields to sit on a designated panel, they will have the opportunity to ask us relevant questions and a general audience will also be present.
Wish us luck, you'll be able to see how we got on here ).
