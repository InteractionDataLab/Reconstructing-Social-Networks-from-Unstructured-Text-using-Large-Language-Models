Single Gene Plasmids and Enzyme Characterisation: 16th - 20th July 2012
Monday 16th July (11.00)
• BioBrick extraction of RBS BioBrick (BBa_B0034) and TetR repressible promoter (BBa_R0040)
• Transformation of RBS BioBrick and TetR promoter
Tuesday 17th July (15.00)
• Adding cultures with RBS and TetR promoter into liquid medium and incubation overnight
Protocol was followed using ampicillin for all BioBrick parts as the selection antibiotic.
Wednesday 18th July (15.00)
• Adding cultures with RBS and TetR promoter into liquid medium and incubation overnight
No cultures were found in all liquid mediums and thus repeated.
Thursday 18th July (9.00)
• Mini-Prepping of RBS and TetR promoter
• Gel Electrophoresis to check fragment sizes of RBS and TetR promoter
Gel Electrophoresis showed that RBS and TetR promoter were successfully cloned. Lane 1 = DNA hyperladder, Lane 3 = TetR promoter mini-prep 2 (expected: 2155bp since TetR promoter is too small to be seen at 54bp), Lane 4 = TetR promoter mini-prep 3 (expected: 2155bp since TetR promoter is too small to be seen at 54bp), Lane 5 = TetR promoter mini-prep 4 (expected: 2155bp since TetR promoter is too small to be seen at 54bp), Lane 6 = RBS mini-prep 1 (expected: 2155bp since RBS is too small to be seen at 12bp), Lane 7 = RBS mini-prep 2 (expected: 2155bp since RBS is too small to be seen at 12bp), Lane 8 = RBS mini-prep 3 (expected: 2155bp since RBS is too small to be seen at 12bp), Lane 9 = RBS mini-prep 4 (expected: 2155bp since RBS is too small to be seen at 12bp), Lane 10 = DNA hyperladder.
