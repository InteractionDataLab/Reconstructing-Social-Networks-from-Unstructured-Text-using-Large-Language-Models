Introduction
What is Synthetic Biology?
Synthetic Biology is a prominent area of science that offers the potential to open up vast areas of new research. It encompasses both science and engineering to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems as well as re-designing existing biological systems for useful endeavours.
What is iGEM?
iGEM is the “international Genetically Engineered Machine” competition for interdisciplinary undergraduate student teams. iGEM seeks to test the idea that biology can be engineered in the manner proposed by synthetic biology. Each student team must devise a project in which they design and engineer a novel “genetic machine”. Teams are given a kit of biological parts which they are encouraged to use and characterise, whilst also submitting new parts and devices for future teams to exploit. The teams present their project and results at regional jamborees. Several teams progress to the world finals based at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US. There are various judging criteria ranging from designing the best wiki to having the best modelling practice, this is yet another element in which the multi disciplinary learning opportunity is highlighted.
Since its competitive beginning in 2006 iGEM has grown rapidly, with 193 University’s entering for the 2012 competition!
A little bit about Us...
The University of Exeter is situated in the heart of Devon's capital city!
This year the University is entering their first team into the iGEM competition. The team consists of four Biologists, four Physicists, an Engineer and a Mathematician. They have the support of several members of staff who have all been willing to give up their spare time to help when needed.
