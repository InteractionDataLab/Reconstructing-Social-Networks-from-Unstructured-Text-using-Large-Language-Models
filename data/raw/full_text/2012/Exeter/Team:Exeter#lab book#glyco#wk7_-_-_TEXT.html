Web4.py Design
Completed a design for the web page interface. Begins with home page offering the user several options with @route('/home')
Then a page where the user can create their own polysaccharide by entering the sugar units making up the repeat unit and clicking the button 'fetch enzymes', @route('/build').
Random chain page where the user can create their own random polysaccharide by specifying the chain length, @route('/random').
Page for adding an enzyme to Glycobase. The user is asked for the enzyme name, acceptor sugar, donor sugar and whether it is characterized, @route('/Add_Enzyme').
After submitting the enzyme there is a completion page, @route('/Add_Enzyme/submit').
Help page, @route('/help').
Some routes could be dynamic.
