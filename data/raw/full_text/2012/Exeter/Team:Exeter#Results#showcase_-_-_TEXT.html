Results: Showcasing Polysaccharide Production
Showcasing Polysaccharide Production - Becca Philp
The unique and variable properties of polysaccharides in nature led us to attempt production of a variety of polysaccharides from different natural sources into our E. coli. These polysaccharides have variable structures and important applications in diverse business sectors.  The Hyaluronan synthase and cyclodextrin      glycosyltransferase enzymes were successfully cloned, sequenced inside pSB1C3 plasmids and submitted to the registry for future teams to realise their potential products      (BBa_K764022 and BBa_K764026 respectively).
Using 3A assembly we then proceeded to attempt production of the gene constructs for expression in our E coli. Each of the showcase enzymes were successfully linked to      terminators on their own. We successfully linked these to promoter-RBS sequences. Full constructs of SacB and HAS were then tested in the Single Gene Plasmids and Enzyme Characterisation project.
Newcastle iGEM 2010’s biobrick BBa_K322921 was adapted by adding to the signal peptide OmpA and promoter-RBS sequence. These sequences were confirmed in pSB1C3 plasmids and      submitted to the registry as:
BBa_K764033 Tetr promoter_rbs_ompA_SacB-Term
BBa_K764034 Pbad Weak promoter_rbs_ompA- SacB-Term
BBa_K764026 Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase + double terminator
BBa_K764025 Hyaluronan synthase + double terminator
BBa_K764024 SacB + double terminator
The linking of Levansucrase, the adaption of Newcastle iGEM 2010’s gene for SacB, to a signal peptide ompA, was to allow the enzyme to be exported from the cell. This was for two      reasons, firstly to demonstrate that our polysaccharides could be produced both intracellular and extracellularly, but also because levansucrase is toxic to E. coli so we      wanted to allow its production by E.coli without damaging the cells. Due to time left, we were unable to show that this had worked.
