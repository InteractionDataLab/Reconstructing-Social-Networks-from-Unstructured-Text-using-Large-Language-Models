WEEK ELEVEN
27th-31st August 2012
The physicist Alex Clowsley has been called to action in the wetlab, to pick up where Becca left off. The incredibly gruelling challenge of deciphering her ‘heart’ full labbook was a daunting one for the young biophysicist, but he stepped up to save the day! Little did they know at the time, but this was the week of truth...
Some of what Alex accomplished included: 3A assembly, gel electrophoresis, gel purification,  and 14 transformations (at the same time!). Much to the relief of Alex and to the delight of his two diehard fans, the nonstop biologists Freddie and Mary, all of the transformations resulted in successful single colonies.
Alex’s antics in the lab are documented in the “ Showcasing Polysaccharides ” section of the labbook for the duration of his take over.
The superb Nuffield A-level student Chris Hack came back for an extra 2 days to help our exhausted iGEM team in the lab. He has been a valued member of our team and his hard working attitude and determination didn’t waiver over the 6 weeks he joined us for. A joy to work with, we wish him the best of luck with all his future endeavours.
With the week drawing to a close all hands were on deck in the lab for yet another late finish. Although feeling a little twitchy with wiki withdrawal symptoms due to team deadlines fast approaching, Ryan helped Freddie and Mary with the odd bit of pipetting and spinning. Whilst Alex C triumphantly continued his dominance by doing minipreps, digestions, gels, and spread plates, setting him up neatly for his next week!
With plenty left to in all areas of our project we look forward to the return of James, who may yet know he will be taking over the reins of Liam’s legacy – GLYCO(BASE)/(WEB)/(APP).
