Our frequent discussions with
    <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Exeter/Collaborators#David Santillo"><U>Dr. David Santillo</U></A> highlighted a number of interventions we 	persisted
    with before laboratory work commenced to avoid environmental issues if a release 	event of our genetically modified <I>E.coli</I> occurred. We have used non-mobilisable 
    plasmids in 	the pSB series to prevent transfer of genes and of antibiotic resistance by horizontal gene 	transfer and/or conjugation. Use of laboratory strains One Shot
    <SUP>®</SUP> TOP10 <I>E.coli</I> and <I>E.coli</I> 	BL21(DE3) for cloning and expression of our glycosyltransferase genes respectively will 	prevent the issue of replication 
    in the environment and host infection, meaning both 	survivability and potential hazards of our genetically engineered <I>E.coli</I> in the environment 	would be unlikely. 
    The production of bespoke polysaccharides are unlikely to be a fitness 	advantage to our genetically engineered <I>E.coli</I> and the expression of glycosyltransferase 	
    proteins in such a prokaryotic system will not be detrimental for natural flora and fauna.
     </P><P>David made aware of a potential issue that when <I>E.coli</I> produces our carbohydrate 	polymers, there is a possibility that foaming may occur.  Foaming is an issue because
    it can 	alter liquid flow and may slow down or even impede bacterial growth. Recently, a French 	team were able to produce human milk oligosaccharides in large-scale by 
    metabolically 	engineered <I>E.coli</I>, which were generated both intracellularly and extracellularly (Priem <I>et al</I>, 2002). The 	extracellular deposits of oligosaccharide were predominantly 
    found in the foam, and this is 	beneficial to our project in two ways. Firstly, it would allow us to remove the foam layer and 	retrieve our bespoke polysaccharides much more 
    easily than other known methods of 	extraction such as high-cell-density cultivation. Secondly, the removal of foam would not 	require anti-foaming chemicals such as silicone 
    oils which may contaminate or even reduce 	bacterial growth. David also brought to our attention that if our polysaccharides were 	accidently released, pollution to the 
    environment would be inevitable. However, we are 	developing our technology in a biosafety level 2 laboratory even though the organism and 	product we are producing are 
    considered biosafety level 1 containment measures, so 	release of our polysaccharides into the environment is unlikely. Even if pollution was still 	possible, we are 
    generating less polluting waste products using biological synthesis of 	polysaccharides than synthetic chemistry methods <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Exeter/Human_Practices/impact" style="color:#57b947">(<U>Biological <I>vs.</I> Chemical Synthesis, Impact and the Future)</U></A>.</P><P><B>Environmental Considerations BEYOND the Project</B></P><P>Our meeting with <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Exeter/Collaborators#Janet Cotter"><U>Dr. Janet Cotter</U></A> continued to raise awareness of the 
    potential impact of our bespoke polysaccharides on the environment, reiterating that the biggest impact on ecosystems would be new sources of nutrition. 
    Polysaccharides, or sugars, are frequently degraded to simple sugars or mono and disaccharides, such as glucose or sucrose 	respectively. These carbon sources are 
    subsequently used for respiratory metabolism and 	are critical sources of nutrition. If there was an accidental polysaccharide release event, there is a potential for new 
    sources of food and could lead to explosions in food webs. In 	fact, for certain species with appropriate enzymes to digest these polysaccharides, a new selection pressure 
    will be applied against those that do not possess such appropriate 	digestion enzymes. This will dramatically affect biodiversity.</P><P>As a result of our discussion with Janet, we propose bell-jar experiments in a contained system within the laboratory to determine what the effects the digestibility of 
    our bespoke polysaccharides could be on soil biodiversity. We will introduce common saprophytic fungi (such as members of the <I>Rhizopus</I> and <I>Mucor</I> 
    families) and bacteria (such as actinomycetes) capable of breaking down polysaccharides into soil and then to determine such affects (if any) by tracing possible 
    degradation products of our carbohydrate polymers. After these experiments, we will identify risks associated with an accidental polysaccharide release event and determine 
    if there are any hazards which require a higher level of containment. This will enforce stricter containment measures and decrease the probability of such a release event 
    occurring.</P><P>The phenomenon referred to as the “Mucilage of the Northern Adriatic” is an example of what a polysaccharide release event may have on the environment. This phenomenon that 	    takes place in the sea has been occurring over the last three centuries and is undoubtedly caused by a release of polysaccharides. Originally thought to be extruded by 	
    phosphorus limiting algae, others are contesting that cyano- and heterobacteria are capable of producing ectohydrolytic enzymes which generate long-lived polysaccharides. 
    This release event causes scum to form on the ocean surface and its extent is so huge that it can be seen 	by satellite. This process has been extensively studied because 
    of the potential significance this phenomenon has on global carbon cycles, especially as it is now thought the recently frequent events ensuing is due to climate change. 
    Whilst this process occurs in sea water and not on land, accidental polysaccharide release events clearly have a marked effect and 	we have considered necessary precautions 
    in such an event occurring on land seriously.</P><P>What is the impact to people and businesses?</P><P> Priem, B. <I>et al.</I> (2002) A new fermentation process allows large-scale production of human milk oligosaccharides by metabolically engineered bacteria, <I>Glycobiology</I>. <B>12</B>: 235-240.</P><FONT face="Verdana" color="#57b947" size="3"><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Exeter/Human_Practices/biosecure"><U>&lt;&lt; Biosecurity and Data Mis-use</U></A></FONT><FONT face="Verdana" color="#57b947" size="3"><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Exeter/Human_Practices/impact"><U>Impact and the Future &gt;&gt;</U></A></FONT><TABLE width="980" align="center" cellspacing="20"><TBODY><TR align="center"><TD><FONT color="#57B947" size="1" face="Verdana"><P><U>Website Designed and Built by: Ryan Edginton, James Lynch &amp; Alex Clowsley</U>  |  <A href="https://igem.org/Team.cgi?id=764" style="color:#57B947" target="_blank"><U>Contact Us</U></A>  |  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Exeter/site_map" style="color:#57B947"><U>Site Map</U></A></P></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><DIV class="printfooter">
