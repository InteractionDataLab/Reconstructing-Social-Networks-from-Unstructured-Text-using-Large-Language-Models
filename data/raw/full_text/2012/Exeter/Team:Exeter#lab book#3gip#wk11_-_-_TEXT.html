The 3-Gene Inducible Plasmid: 17th - 21st September 2012
Monday 17th September
Disaster! I had not heat deactivated the enzymes after digestion so I had to perform the transfer of the BioBricks into pSB1C3 again. A repeat of Fridays lab but the ligation was left overnight in the fridge.
Tuesday 18th September
Today I was handing the lab work over to Alex. Please see Single Gene Plasmids and Enzyme Characterisation: 24th - 28th September 2012.
