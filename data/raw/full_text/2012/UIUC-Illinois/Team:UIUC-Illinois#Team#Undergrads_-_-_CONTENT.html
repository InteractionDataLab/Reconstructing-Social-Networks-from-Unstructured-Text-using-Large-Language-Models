This is his first year in iGEM. He decided to join iGEM because he felt that synthetic biology possessed a potential that has an unprecedented power in influencing the future of biology. He wanted to apply his knowledge and imagination into building innovative biological circuits that could have novel functions and applications. The idea of working with a team of undergraduates to probe the vast potential of synthetic biology seemed truly fascinating as well. In addition, he found the iGEM logo curiously attractive. Anthony is an avid squash player. He also enjoys watching movies that make him smile, laugh, or cry.

She hails from the St. Louis, MO area, and is proud to bring her own diversity to the team. Cara first became interested in biology in general when she was a freshman in high school. She was inspired by the Punnett Squareâs ability to predict the phenotype of the offspring of two individuals and was later drawn to epigenetics through a NOVA science episode. The field of synthetic biology also intrigued her after she heard about J. Craig Venterâs work in California and his tenacious work ethic. Cara worked for approximately two years at Washington University in St. Louis as a laboratory assistant in Dr. Doug Chalkerâs lab. There she met her greatest inspiration, a Mr. Scott Horrell, who became her mentor and adviser. Horrell encouraged her to attend the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where she thrives in the rigorous and diverse atmosphere. When she is not in class, lab, or the library, Cara enjoys musical performances, lounging on the Quad, drinking tea, reading period novels, supporting the Illini, and sampling the ethnic cuisine on campus</FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV id="div9" style="display:none"><TABLE cellspacing="5" border="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR valign="top" align="left"><TD width="790" valign="top" align="left"><P><CENTER><FONT size="6">Divya Tankasala</FONT></CENTER></P><P align="center">I'm a freshman at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and I'm majoring in Bioengineering, with an intended track focus on biomechanics.

As a bioengineer, I'm really excited to be part of a student-run research competition associated with synthetic biology and genetic engineering! In my free time, I blog (tumblr), read just about any random article I find lying around, blast an eclectic variety music through my noise-cancelling headphones, handle various alumni relations as a member of SWE and Engineering Student Ambassadors, eat like a machine, and work until obscene hours of the night.
