Inoculation
What you need:
- Falcon tubes
- The appropriate liquid media
- The appropriate antibiotic
- An agar plate containing the cells of interest or a frozen stock solution
- Autoclaved pipet tips
Procedure:
1. To an autoclaved glass test tube with lid, add: 2-5 mL liquid media, 2-5 ul antibiotic (dilute to 1/1000)
2. Using a pipet tip,  gently poke a single colony of plated cells, or scratch cells onto the stick form the frozen freezer stock (taking colonies from a plate typically yields better results)
3. Stir cells into the liquid media
4. Label the test tubes and place them in 37˚C warm room overnight to grow (12-16 hrs)
