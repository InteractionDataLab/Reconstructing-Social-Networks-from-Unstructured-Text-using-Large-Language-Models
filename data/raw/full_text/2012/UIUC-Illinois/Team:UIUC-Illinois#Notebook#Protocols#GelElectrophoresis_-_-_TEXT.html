Making Gel Electrophoresis gel solutions
To check PCR results
What you need:
- High-melt agarose
- TAE buffer 1X
- Autoclaved container
Procedure:
1. Add 3.2g high-melt agarose to 400 mL 1X TAE buffer (50 uL agarose gel, 250 mL 1X TAE buffer for the small gel box)
2. Microwave flask or bottle (cap placed loosely if bottle) of mixed solution to dissolve gel in 1 minute increments until all agarose is dissolved
3. BE CAREFUL AS LIQUID CAN BE SUPERHEATED
To do a gel purification
What you need:
- Low-melt agarose
- TAE buffer 1X
- Autoclaved container
Procedure:
1. Add 4.0g low-melt agarose to 400 mL 1X TAE buffer
2. Microwave flask or bottle (cap placed loosely if bottle) of mixed solution to dissolve gel in 1 minute increments until all agarose is dissolved
3. BE CAREFUL AS LIQUID CAN BE SUPERHEATED
