Mission Statement
The ultimate goal of the University of Illinois 2012 iGEM team is to construct an RNA-based PUF protein toolkit which can be utilized for the manipulation of gene expression. Customizable manipulation will involve gene silencing by specific RNA scission. Also, the PUF protein's properties are suited for optimizing multi-step enzymatic pathways. In this way, we aim to improve the versatility and cost efficiency of biological production systems. With a protein-based RNA-binding toolkit, researchers will be able to transmute the biobricked PUF for use in their scientific endeavors. In addition, we seek to standardize and characterize the nature of PUF.

Our Research Outside of PUF Itself
Aside from researching the RNA specific affinity of PUF and its endonuclease fusion protein variants, we have also explored and tested other potential applications for PUF. Mainly, our ancillary projects directly related to PUF include our RNA scaffold and an enzymatic assembly line based on such a scaffold. Additionally, we have characterized the 2011 University of Washington iGEM team's Petrobrick (BBa_K590025) .
Outside the dry and wet labs, we have invested ourselves in a human practices project and public awareness and education about synthetic biology and science in general. To learn more, please visit our Outreach section .

Enzymatic Assembly Line
In utilizing the versatility of the PUF based toolkit we are developing, our current research involves an engineered metabolic pathway. The characterization and standardization of these genes in biobrick format is underway. Future goals involving the PUF toolkit will focus on tethering enzymes of productive artificial or natural pathways for kinetic favorability.
PUF
This is the PUF protein found on the PUM1 gene in humans. Our main focus and cause of interest in this protein is its ability to recognize single stranded RNA with specificity. The ability to modify PUF with tethered or fused proteins allows for the development of a customizable RNA binding toolkit. Depending on what fusion or tether is used, the functionality of the PUF protein is modified as well.
RNA scission
In fusion the PUF protein to a restriction endonuclease, the fusion protein demonstrates the ability to cleave single stranded RNA molecules with customizable specificity up to eight base pairs. Considering this ability, we believe PUF can prove itself as a promising new tool in researching and developing new types of gene therapy as it can silence genes with seqeunces specific to a reseachers interest.>
RNA scaffold utilization
Since PUF has affinity towards RNA molecules, it is possible to synthesize or utilize existing stemloop structures in RNA in order to provide a kinetically favorable platform for tethered proteins to interact.
