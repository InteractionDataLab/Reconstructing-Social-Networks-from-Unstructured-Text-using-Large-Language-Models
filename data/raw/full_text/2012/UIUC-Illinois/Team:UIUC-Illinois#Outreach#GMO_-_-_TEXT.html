Collaboration Overview
We are proud to collaborate with fellow iGEMmers from Cornell, the University of Michigan, Northwestern, and the University of Southern Denmark to produce a video series on GMOs, or Genetically Modified Organisms. We hope to engage the general public in a thoughtful conversation on this hot topic by discussing the history, ethics, and future of several GMO areas, all of which have been effected by the innovations of synthetic biology.
Over the past few weeks all of us have been hard at work doing preliminary research, reaching out to the synbio community, and writing shooting scripts. As we move forward and begin shooting our videos, stay tuned for updates and sneak peeks
