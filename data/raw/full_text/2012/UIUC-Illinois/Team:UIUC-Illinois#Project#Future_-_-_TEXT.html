Ancillary Projects and Future Directions
This section covers projects we have designed and are invested in aside from our PUF research. Ancillary projects like utilizing the RNA scaffold and Enzymatic Assembly Line are directly related to the applications made possible by the use of our PUF toolkit which have not been previously elaborated upon. The characterization of the 2011 University of Washington's Petrobrick is unrelated to our project. However, as an endeavor in the standardization of synthetic biology and the Parts Registry, it was necesary for our team to contribute further to the foundational cause.
Click on the list to the left or on the dropdown menu from hovering over the "Ancillary" tab to read more about our Ancillary Projects and Future Directions on their respective pages.
