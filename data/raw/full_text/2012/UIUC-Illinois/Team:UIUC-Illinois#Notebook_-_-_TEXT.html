UIUC iGEM Protocols
The standard protocols for each technique used in our project endeavors have been documented. Unless further noted all procedures are based off of those used by the lab of C. V. Rao .
Bootcamp Protocols
Making LB for plates
To make 1 Liter of LB:
1. Always use a 10:5:5 ratio of Tryptone to Yeast Extract to NaCl.
2. Add dry ingredients first.
3. Use a 2L flask.
4. Add the following
- 10 g Tryptone
- 5 g Yeast Extract
- 5 g NaCl
- 1.5 g Agar (NOT agarose!)
4. Then add 1 L of MilliQ water.
5. Autoclave by total volume.
6. Pour 25 mL on each plate (just enough to cover the bottom).
Making Liquid Media
1. Always use a 5-2.5-2.5 ratio of Tryptone to Yeast Extract to NaCl
2. Add dry ingredients first, then add MilliQ water
3. No Agar!
4. Autoclave by total volume
Making Glycerol Stock
To make 400 mL of 10% glycerol you will need:
-40 mL glycerol
-360 mL of MilliQ water
To make 400 mL of 20% glycerol you will need:
-80 mL glycerol
-320 mL of MilliQ water
1. Use flasks and bottles before graduated cylinders (they take forever to mix!)
2. Need a stir plate and a large stir bar
3. Stir until mixture is homogeneous
4. Don’t autoclave!
Making ddH2O
- Use the small bottles.
- Autoclave water by total volume.
Autoclaving
- Robert is the source of official help on all things about the Autoclave.
1. Use the autoclave tape.
2. Look at the Betastar for settings.
3. Go by materials and total volume.
4. Make sure the autoclave tape has changed colour by the end of the cycle. Check conditions and settings then repeat steps 1-4 if tape has not changed colour.
Ligation
We used the Ginkgo bioworks protocol
1. Control:
- 2 uL of Circular PSB1C3 plasmid 13 uL ddH2O
- 2 uL T4 ligase buffer
- 1 uL T4 ligase
2. P&C:
- 2 uL of Circular PSB1C3 plasmid
- 2 uL of PUF, 11 uL ddH2O
- 2 uL T4 ligase buffer
- 1 uL T4 ligase
3. L&P:
- 2 uL of linear PSB1C3 plasmid
- 2 uL of PUF
- 11 uL ddH2O
- 2 uL T4 ligase buffer
- 1 uL T4 ligase
Digestions
Reaction Mix:
- 500 ng – Template
- 5 µl – 10x Buffer
- 1 µl – NEB Enzyme 1 (10 Units/µl) = 10 Units in 50 µl reaction
- 1 µl – NEB Enzyme 2 (10 Units/µl) = 10 Units in 50 µl reaction
- dH2O to 50 µl
- TOTAL – 50 µl
Procedure:
1. Calculate how much template is needed for digestion. Then calculate how much water needs to be added to make a 50 µl reaction.
2. Pipette appropriate amounts of dH20, template, and 10x Buffer in that order into a PCR tube (200 µl). Mix reagents together by vortexing and then tapping tube on desk to keep reagents on the bottom of the PCR tube.
3. Add appropriate amounts of Enzyme 1 and Enzyme 2. Once added gently swirl around reaction mix with pipette tip.
4. Incubate at 37o C for 1 – 2 hours
5. Incubate at 80 oC for 20 minutes to deactivate the restriction enzymes
6. Run a gel of your digestions on a gel with low temperature melting agarose. Run at 100V for 1 hr. 30 min.
7. Look at gel under 320nm UV light. Conduct gel extraction purification.
NOTE: When digesting your vector it may be useful to use 2 µl of each enzyme in the 50 µl reaction and extending incubation time.
Gel Purification
What you need:
- The sample of interest, typically a DNA double-digest (50 uL)
- A low-melt gel
- Razor blade
- Autoclaved 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes
- Agarose-dissolving buffer (ADB)
- Big Zymo-spin columns in collection tubes
- DNA wash buffer
- Autoclaved MilliQ water
Procedure:
1. Place each sample into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
2. To each tube, add 3 volumes of ADB (i.e for 100 uL gel slice add 300 uL ADB)
3. Incubate at 37-55˚C in the warm water bath until the gel is completely dissolved (if DNA fragment is larger than 8kb, add one additional gel volume of water to the tube following incubation for better DNA recovery)
4. Transfer the melted agarose solution to a Zymo-spin column in a collection tube
5. Centrifuge for 30 seconds and discard liquid flow-through
6. To the column, add 200uL wash buffer
7. Centrifuge for 30 seconds and discard the liquid flow-through
8. Repeat steps 6-7
9. Centrifuge the empty column for 30 seconds
10. Place column in a new 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
11. Gently add 30uL autoclaved water to the column
12. Let column stand for 2 minutes
13. Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds to elute pure DNA into the tube and store at -20˚C until use
Inoculation
What you need:
- Falcon tubes
- The appropriate liquid media
- The appropriate antibiotic
- An agar plate containing the cells of interest or a frozen stock solution
- Autoclaved pipet tips
Procedure:
1. To an autoclaved glass test tube with lid, add: 2-5 mL liquid media, 2-5 ul antibiotic (dilute to 1/1000)
2. Using a pipet tip,  gently poke a single colony of plated cells, or scratch cells onto the stick form the frozen freezer stock (taking colonies from a plate typically yields better results)
3. Stir cells into the liquid media
4. Label the test tubes and place them in 37˚C warm room overnight to grow (12-16 hrs)
Ligations
Set-up:
1. Run a gel of your digestions and take a picture.
2. Estimate the intensities of your insert and vector where your insert (usually less intense) is considered 1 and your vector is x times as bright.
3. Once intensity is determined perform the following equation:
L = Ligation volume
S = Size of fragments
I = Intensity of fragments
V = Volume ran down gel
i = Insert
v = Vector
4. Ligation volume (Lv) for the vector should be approximately 2 µl.
5. The ratio for the ligation in the previous equation is 3:1 insert:vector but can be done 6:1 by replacing the 3 with a 6.
Reaction Mix:
- 2 µl – Vector
- Li µl – Insert
- 2 µl – 10x Buffer
- dH20 to 19 µl
- 1 µl – T4 DNA Ligase
- TOTAL – 20 µl
Procedure:
1. Add appropriate amounts of dH20, Vector, and Insert in a PCR tube (200 µl). Once added, heat mixture to 65o C for 5 min. This will remove all items that are already annealed to each other causing inefficient ligation.
2. Add then appropriate amounts of 10x Buffer and T4 DNA Ligase. Make sure not to pipette up and down or vortex to mix, this will shear the ligase. Gently swirl with the tip of your pipette to mix.
3. Incubate reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes.
4. After incubation heat inactivate the ligase by another incubation at 80o C for 20 min.
NOTE: The ligase buffer should smell like wet dog. If you smell nothing from the tube, then the buffer is old and useless.
Can also use the Ginkgo Bioworks protocol:
1. Get the 10X T4 DNA ligase buffer and the T4 DNA ligase from the 20 degree storage.
2. Put them on ice to thaw.
3. In a PCR tube add 11 uL of water.
4. Add 2 uL of each digest to the tube.
5. Use a pipet to thoroughly mix the T4 DNA ligase buffer and resuspend the precipitate in the bottom. Then add 2 uL to the PCR tube.
6. Add 1 uL of T4 DNA ligase.
7. Flick the tube to mix it. If necessary, put it in the microcentrifuge to get all the liquid back to the bottom.

PCR Troubleshooting
Ran a diagnostic test to optimize buffer and temperature for the PCR. After doing the PCR (it’s nice to do this in linked PCR tubes) we run on a gel to test which worked best.
Buffers tested: GC + DMSO, HF + DMSO, GC, buffer G supermix + DMSO (3 tubes of each)
Made a master mix of primers, phusion, template DNA, and dNTPs. This was then used this for all the tubes of GC+DMSO, HF+DMSO, and GC.
Master Mix:
- 10 uL dNTP’s
- 2 uL forward primers
- 2 uL reverse primers
- 2 uL template DNA
- 1 uL phusion
GC + DMSO:
- 18 uL H2O

- 5.1 uL of master mix
- 0.9 uL DMSO
- now divide into 3 tubes (10 uL into each PCR tube)
HF + DMSO:
- 18 uL H2O
- 6 uL HF buffer
- 5.1 uL of master mix
- 0.9 uL DMSO
Now divide into 3 tubes (10 uL into each PCR tube)
GC:

PCR program:
1. 98 degrees Celsius for 3 minutes
2. 98 degrees C for 15 seconds
3. Temperature gradient 48-55-63 degrees for 30 seconds
4. 72 degrees C for 1 minute
5. Go to step 2, repeat 30 times
6. 72 degrees C for 5 minutes
Gel results: Only buffer G +DMSO works and it works at all temperatures.

- 15 uL buffer G
- 12 uL H2O
- 0.9 uL DMSO
- 0.6 uL forward primer
- 0.6 uL reverse primer
- 0.6 uL template DNA

1. 98 degrees Celsius for 3 minutes
2. 98 degrees C for 15 seconds
3. 63 degrees C for 30 seconds
4. 72 degrees C for 1 minute
5. Go to step 2, repeat 30 times
6. 72 degrees C for 5 minutes
Storing cells in Glycerol Solution
What you need:
- 1.5 mL cryogenic vials
- 50% glycerol solution (can also use 20%)
- An overnight culture of the cells of interest
Procedure:
1. To a cryogenic vial, add 600 uL 50% glycerol solution and 400 uL liquid cell culture
2. Mix thoroughy and store in the -80˚C freezer until use
Unless noted, all procedures are based on those in the lab of Christopher Rao .
Subculturing E. Coli
What you need:
- Autoclaved 250 mL flasks
- Liquid Media
- Antibiotic, if necessary (not for DH5a c competent cells)
- An overnight culture of the cells of interest
Procedure:
1. Into your autoclaved flask add:
- 50 mL liquid media
- 50 ul antibiotic solution if necessary
- 500 uL overnight liquid culture.
Note: there is a 1:100 ratio of cells to media. Furthermore there is a 1:1000 ratio of antibiotic to media. When subculturing DH5alpha, antibiotic solutions are not required.
2. Incubate in the 37˚C warm room on a stirrer for 4-6 hours
Note: Need to check the cells 2 hours after inoculation to test their optical density (OD). The best competent cells come from cells in exponential phase of their growth. Therefore an OD of 0.4-0.8 is desired and this happens after 2-4 hours of incubation.
Electroporation and Transformation
You will need:
- 100 µl – Electrocompetent Cells
- 2-5 µl – Ligation Reaction (10 – 100 ng DNA)
- 1 ml – SOC broth/ LB liquid media
- Electrocuvette
Procedure:
1. Gather all your supplies and keep them on ice (or in 4o C room). This includes the cuvettes.
2. Thaw frozen electrocompetent cells on ice and place in electrocuvette. Then add ligation reaction and tap the cuvette to mix well. 3. DO NOT pipette up and down.
4. Keep on ice for 1 min.
5. Pulse once (On machine use Ec1 for 1mm cuvettes and Ec2 for 2mm cuvettes).
6. IMMEDIATELY after add 1ml of SOC broth and pipette up and down gently.
7. Incubate recovering cells in 37o C for 1 hr.
Plating:
1. After incubation, plate 200 µl of transformants on to appropriate selective plate and incubate at 37o C for 18+ hrs.
2. If no colonies are formed plate out the rest of the transformants (~800 µl) and incubate at 37o C for 24 hrs
