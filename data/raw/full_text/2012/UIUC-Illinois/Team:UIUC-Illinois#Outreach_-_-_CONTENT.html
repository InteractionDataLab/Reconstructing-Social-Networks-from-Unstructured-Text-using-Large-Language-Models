House, or EOH. Over two sunny days on March 9 and 10, iGEM presented one of over 230
exhibits as part of one of the country’s largest science fairs.  

Our exhibit on synthetic biology
and the manipulation of DNA fit perfectly with the event’s theme, “Dream, Design, Discover.”
At our booth we explained what DNA was to school children and then amazed them by
allowing them to extract their own DNA via salt water and rubbing alcohol! 

We explained the
amazing uses of biobricks by displaying plates with drawings colored by E. Coli transformed with
YFP, GFP, and mCherry. 



We also discussed the safety and ethics of such genetic
manipulations with parents and professors who stopped by our station.</P><P>Pictures of the event can be found at our <A href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/igemuiuc/

As a part of the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program, the students were of a high school age demographic. However, the demographic and educational backgrounds has its differences from the standard educational system. Members of our team who had participated in educational scientific demonstrations had never been exposed to environment of a military academy. The scientific demonstrations involved:
<UL><LI>Fluorescent hand lotion to demonstrate the spread of pathogens through common contact with objects and people</LI><LI>Colouring silly putty and exploring the physical properties of the putty we made</LI><LI>Demonstrating and explaining what happens when dry ice interacts with soap, how temperature affects physical properites of substances</LI><LI>Flash freezing everyday items like candy bars and even the silly putty to show how heat energy is transfered</LI></UL><I>&quot;My visit to those fellow students at the academy will not soon be forgotten. I heard stories, saw faces, and

hopefully made an impression on them. My goal when I went in that building was to shatter any perceptions of

science students and science as “stuffy” and “uptight”. After talking to them between demonstrations, I think I did

that. I wanted to share my belief with them that science and education in general are the most beautiful privileges

we have. In return I feel inspired by them to be a role model and use my talents to help others, wherever I find

myself in the future.”</I><CENTER>- Cara Schornak</CENTER><I>&quot;The faces seemed familiar, but the atmosphere felt so foreign. It was eye opening to say the least; I feel like the schools most of us on the iGEM team went to pampered us with scientific education focuses. I'm glad we were able to open some eyes too, especially with the demonstrations we did with the liquid nitrogen and dry ice.&quot;</I><CENTER>- Bob Chen</CENTER></P></DIV><DIV id="outreach4" style="display:none"><H2>GMO Collaboration</H2>
The overriding purpose of human practices is to educate the public
about what synthetic biology is, what it’s applications are, and the safety of future
developments in the field. To this end we are proud to collaborate with fellow iGEMmers
from Cornell and the University of Southern
Denmark to produce a video series on GMOs, or Genetically Modified Organisms. We
hope to engage the general public in a thoughtful conversation on this hot topic by
discussing the history, ethics, and future of several GMO areas, all of which have been
effected by the innovations of synthetic biology. Please check out the videos at <A href="http://www.youtube.com/user/iGEMHPCollaboration/videos?view=0">our
youtube channel</A>.

In particular, we have created 2 videos – one on transgenic corn and another on gene
therapy.<CENTER><H2>Gene Therapy and Synthetic Biology</H2></CENTER><CENTER><H2>Genetically Modified Corn</H2></CENTER>

While just beginning research, we as a team tried to understand the
impact synthetic biology has made on the public and what type of public impression has
been made. The result of our research was this compilation of resources, which shows
how popular media has reported on synthetic biology advances. It is an excellent source
for both learning more about synthetic biology and understanding how science relates
to social policy.</P><TEXTAREA rows="50" cols="100" readonly="" wrap="soft">Time Magazine
