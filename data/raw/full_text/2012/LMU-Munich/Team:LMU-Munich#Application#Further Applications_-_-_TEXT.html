The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

Further Applications
Ultimately, the ability to express virtually any protein of interest shows great potential for laboratory work. Our Sporobeads could for example express TAL effectors for the binding of sequence-specific DNA stretches. This could allow simple GMO detection of food crops. Besides expressing proteins capable of binding compounds or ions of interest, our Sporobeads could also display proteins which have enzymatic activity. The 2011 University of Washington iGEM team developed an enzyme, Kumamolisin, which cleaves peptides. The substrate of this enzyme is a specific amino acid sequence which causes reactions in individuals with Celiac disease. Such a cleaving enzyme could be used to eliminate irritants from gluten-containing food products.
Sporovector
There are many possible applications for our Sporobeads , as it is possible to display all kinds of different proteins on their surface. To easily create them, we designed a Sporovector in which you just have to insert the gene encoding your fusion protein of choice.
