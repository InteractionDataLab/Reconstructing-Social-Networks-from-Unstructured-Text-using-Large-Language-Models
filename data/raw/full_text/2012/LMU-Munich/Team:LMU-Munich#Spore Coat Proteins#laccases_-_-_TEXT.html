The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

With the help of our Sporovector , we fused two Laccases from Team Bielefeld to cgeA. We chose the Ecol (E. coli) and Bhal (Bacillus halodurans) because they did not contain any fobidden restriction sites (NgoMIV or AgeI for Freiburg standard RFC 25 ). However, the activity of purified protein is quite low in comparison to the other laccases tested by Bielefeld.
The obtained strains were growing slowly, but we were able to test the activity of the spores with the substrate.... . The activity was compared to wild type spores.
The result clearly shows activity for both Laccase-Sporobeads. Consistent with the results from Bielefeld, the activity of Bhal is higher than of Ecol. For us, this proves that the enzyme is displayed on the surface, it is still working and it has access to the substrate! Furthermore, the activity can be clearly measured, although these were not the optimal laccases.
