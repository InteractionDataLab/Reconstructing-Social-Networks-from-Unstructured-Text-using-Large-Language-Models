The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

iGEM Medals
We believe our team deserves the following medal:
Bronze
Silver
Gold
Because we met the following criteria :
Requirements for a Bronze Medal:
1. Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Jamboree.
2. Complete Judging form
3. Team Wiki
4. Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
5. At least one new submitted and well-characterized standard BioBrick Part or Device.
BBa_K823000 , BBa_K823001 , BBa_K823002 , BBa_K823003 , BBa_K823019 , BBa_K823021 , BBa_K823022 , BBa_K823023 , BBa_K823025 , BBa_K823030 , BBa_K823033 , BBa_K823032 , BBa_K823031 , BBa_K823049 , BBa_K823040 , BBa_K823041 , BBa_K823043 , BBa_K823026 , BBa_K823048
A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts.
Additional Requirements for a Silver Medal:
1. Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected.
BBa_K823000 , BBa_K823001 , BBa_K823002 , BBa_K823003 , BBa_K823019 , BBa_K823021 , BBa_K823022 , BBa_K823023 , BBa_K823025 , BBa_K823030 , BBa_K823033 , BBa_K823032 , BBa_K823031 , BBa_K823049 , BBa_K823040 , BBa_K823041 , BBa_K823043
2. Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device.
Enter this information in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
BBa_K823000 , BBa_K823001 , BBa_K823002 , BBa_K823003 , BBa_K823019 , BBa_K823021 , BBa_K823022 , BBa_K823023 , BBa_K823025 , BBa_K823030 , BBa_K823033 , BBa_K823032 , BBa_K823031 , BBa_K823049 , BBa_K823040 , BBa_K823041 , BBa_K823043 , BBa_K823026 , BBa_K823048
Additional Requirements for a Gold Medal: (one OR more)
1. Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device. (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year).
Enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), and don't forget to create a new registry page for the improved part.
BBa_K823019 , BBa_K823003 , BBa_K823004 , BBa_K823005 , BBa_K823006 , BBa_K823007 , BBa_K823008 , BBa_K823009 , BBa_K823010 , BBa_K823011 , BBa_K823012 , BBa_K823013 , BBa_K823014
2. Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
We sent Groningen 10 parts of our Bacillus BioBrickBox, namely: BBa_K823000 , BBa_K823001 , BBa_K823002 , BBa_K823021 , BBa_K823022 , BBa_K823023 , BBa_K823024 , BBa_K823025 , BBa_K823026 . They evaluated BBa_K823023 , BBa_K823024 coming to the same results as we did, and used BBa_K823023 for there sboA-lycopene
3. Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
Innovation: We invited all German teams to the CAS synthetic biology conference enabling them to arrange collaborations, discuss their projects with other teams as well as with the experts visiting this international conference. In addition the attendance at the talks about many topics of synthetic biology might have inspired some of the iGEM team members to new approaches.
Safety: We designed the GerminationSTOP with the two different approaches: germination gene knock out and the Suicide switch. This makes the chassis we use for our project safe to use. This was also discussed with the commissioner for Bio-Safety in Bavaria. See the summary of the discussion here .
Sharing: We envision an iGEM world where work with B. subtilis is as easy as work with E. coli. As most work with B. subtilis is done with strains having a plasmid integrated, the sharing of the plasmid is not as essential as the sharing of the strain itself. It is possible to transfer the gDNA and therefore the integrated element into any other strain (if the integration locus is not already used) quite easily. In addition there are strains produced by deletions of genes. It is not possible to share these over plasmids. To accomplish this, the lab of AG Prof. Thorsten Mascher offers to maintain a Bacillus strain collection from which iGEM members can request or send in strains.
