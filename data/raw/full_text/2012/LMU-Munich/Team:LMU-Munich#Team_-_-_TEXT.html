The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

Who we are
Our iGEM team is a group of seven students and three mentors.
As we are a team of only ten people, and the iGEM competition is a new experience for many of us, we work closely together on all aspects of our work. There is no graph, no abstract, not even a single presentation slide that isn't enthusiastically discussed by the whole team. We divide our lab work as well, so that each of us has spent some time working on the other modules.
All of us are working closely together with our two instructors Prof. Thorsten Mascher and Dr. Tina Wecke and our advisor Dr. Georg Fritz. Prof. Thorsten Mascher is not only offering us a place in his lab, but also a lot of support and input on all parts of the project. Tina is the one to go to for trouble shooting and strategy planning, and Georg is advising us how to best evaluate parts and how to model.
We have a lot of fun working together on Beadzillus!
Where we are from
München mag dich!
This is the slogan of Munich, the city where our team is from. It stands for the cosmopolitan character of Munich. But it is also a declaration of love to its citizens. All of us enjoy the variety of activities that Munich has to offer. The inner city shows traces of Munich|s history, the English Garden provides the space for sunny or snowy days, quarters are complete with diverse museums, galleries, cafes and bars... In many of these quarters you will meet many students, on the run or relaxing between classes, as two universities are located in Munich, Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (LMU) . We study at the LMU, which is famous for over 500 years of research in academics. We comprise the LMU's third iGEM team. Working hard in the lab, we strive to make the LMU, and the city of Munich, proud of our accomplishments in this year's competition.

Team members:
Korinna is a Bachelor student in Biology. She takes care of lab duties and safety, and is also known around the lab as the “data generator.” The sheer amount of data derived from her work and evaluation of all our promoters is the heart of our well evaluated BacillusBioBrickBox module. We all appreciate Korinna for her hard working attitude. Korinna comes from Heidelberg, Germany, and is 23 years old. She will pursue her Master of Biology here at the LMU next year.
Franzi is a Bachelor student in Biology. She is working to fuse different proteins to the spore crust as part of the Sporobead module. Franzi is also developing the design for our Amsterdam (European Jamboree) presentation. With Tamara, she recently celebrated the accomplishment of fusing GFP to the outer spore crust. Franzi comes from Stuttgart and is 22 years old. Franzi's upbeat attitude keeps us all going in the lab. She will pursue her Master of Biology here at the LMU next year.
Tamara is a Master student in Biology. She works on the fusion of different proteins to the spore crust as part of the Sporobead module. Tamara also controls and develops the design for our Amsterdam (European Jamboree) presentation. Tamara has contributed greatly to the website design, and together with Simon, planned and implemented the Students Practical . Tamara originally comes from Serbia, and is 24 years old. Tamara's dedication to the lab is invaluable to the team. She will finish her Master of Biology next year, and will then pursue a PhD.
Simon is a Master student in Biology. He worked with Bacillus during his Bachelor degree, and enjoys working with it. Despite his appreciation for Bacillus, he has taken on the challenging job of balancing our Sponsoring and budgeting, website and information sharing, Human practice , Collaborations , and all of the miscellaneous tasks we seem to come up with. Without Simon, we'd be lost! Simon comes from Munich, and is 25 years old. Next year, he will complete his Master of Biology, and then looks forward to a PhD.
Julia is a Master student in Biochemistry. This is her third time participating in iGEM. Julia has the know-how and calmness of an experienced iGEM member. In the lab, she has inventively developed and created the Suicideswitch aspect of the GerminationSTOP module. In the beginning she also helped Jara with the BacillusBioBrickBox and with the Gene Knockout aspect of the GerminationSTOP module. Also she continued the Inverter from last year's team. We appreciate Julia's passion for science. Julia comes from Munich, and is 22 years old. Julia will complete her Master of Biochemistry next year, and will then pursue a PhD.
Jenny is Master student in Biology. She is responsible for inhibiting germination in the Gene Knockout aspect of the GerminationSTOP module. Jenny is also responsible for all English editing, and graphics and design for our Amsterdam (European Jamboree) presentation. Jenny is known in the lab for her good sense of humor. Jenny comes from Seattle, USA, and is 26 years old. Next year Jenny will complete her Master of Biology, and looks forward to a PhD.
Jara is a Master student in Biology. 2012 marks Jara's third time participating in the iGEM competition. For all of the newbies, Jara is known as our “walking library”. Her depth of understanding and patience are appreciated by the whole team. Jara has worked on every module of the Beadzillus project, helping out especially with the BacillusBioBrickBox . Jara comes from Munich and is 23 years old. She will complete her Master of Biology next year, and then will pursue her PhD.
