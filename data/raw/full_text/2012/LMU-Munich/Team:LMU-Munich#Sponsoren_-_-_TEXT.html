The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

Sponsors
Several public institutions generously supported our team and enabled us to take part at the iGEM competition 2012 by paying the registration fees for both the initial application and the jamborees and the travel expenses for Amsterdam and lab material.
Visit later our Sponsors page for more information.
Thank you!
