The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

B4 - 22 core parts for Bacillus subtilis
A major goal of our iGEM project is to introduce B. subtilis as a new chassis for BioBrick-based synthetic biology. For that purpose, we created a toolbox of Bacillus BioBricks to contribute to the registry to make it accessible to many more future iGEM-teams and the entire public microbiology domain! This Bacillus BioBrick Box (B4) contains the following Bacillus specific parts:
Vectors
Promoters
Reporters
Affinity tags
pSBBs1C
pSBBs4S
pSBBs2E
pSBBs1C-lacZ
pSBBs3C-luxABCDE
pSBBs4S-Pxyl
pSBBs0K-Pspac

Since Bacillus subtilis is not an organism commonly used in iGEM, please check out our Introduction to learn more about it.
Bacillus Vectors
We have generated a suite of BioBrick-compatible vectors: three empty insertional backbones with different antibiotic resistances and integration loci, two reporter and two expression vectors.
Bacillus Promoters
To provide a set of promoters of different strength we characterized several promoters in Bacillus subtilis. Both constitutive and inducible promoters are covered.
Bacillus Reporters
We designed and codon-optimized a set of reporters that are commonly used in B. subtilis.
Affinity Tags
We synthesized 5 affinity tags for protein purification. They all are designed in Freiburg standard with an optimized ribosome binding site upstream. We have not yet tested our tags.
