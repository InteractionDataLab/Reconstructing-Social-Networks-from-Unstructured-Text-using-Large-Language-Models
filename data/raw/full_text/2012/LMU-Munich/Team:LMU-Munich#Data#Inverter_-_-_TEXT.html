The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

β-galoctisidase assay of the Inverter with lacZα
β-Galactosidase assay of Inverter with lacZα as reporter. The higher the arabinose concentration, the higher the translational repression of uofCGU-lacZα
The Inverter is composed of the pBAD promoter (lacking the repressor binding sites), which produces the short RNA RyhB. RyhB binds to uofCGU and masks the Shine Dalgarno sequence, thereby translationally repressing it. UofCGU is translationally fused to lacZα, and therefore also translationally repressed. UofCGU-lacZα is produced by an IPTG-inducible Promoter which is induced with 1mM IPTG. The PBAD is titrated with arabinose. The higher the arabinose concentration is, the higher the RyhB concentration and consequently the lacZα translational repression.
