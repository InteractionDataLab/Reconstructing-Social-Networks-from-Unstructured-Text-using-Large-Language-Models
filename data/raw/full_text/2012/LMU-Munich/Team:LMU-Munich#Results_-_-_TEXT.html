The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

Here you will find the main results of our work.
Seven novel vectors were constructed and four already proven to work in B. subtilis.

15 Promoters evaluated in B. subtilis and added to the registry!
This section gives an overview on the strength of all evaluated promoters, which span a large range of activities. For more details and informations of the experiments see the Data page of the promoters. Note that Pveg was not evaluated with luminescence measurements and this bar is just projected from the results of the β-galactosidase assay.
Overview of promoter activity evaluated with luminescence measurements in pSBBs3C-luxABCDE. These values derive from the experiments you can find in our Data section. Lumi per OD600 are taken at a OD600 of 0.1. Values are the average and the standard deviation of three different experiments for clone 1. Shown is the activity of the Anderson promoters J23100 (#100), J23101 (#101), J23102 (#102), J23103 (#103), J23106 (#106), J23107 (#107), J23113 (#113), J23114 (#114), J23115 (#115), J23117 (#117), J23118 (#118) as well as the activity of the constitutive promoters PliaG, and PlepA. The activity of the inducible promoter PliaI is shown with (+bac) and without (-bac) induction with bacitracin (10 μg/ml). The promoter activity of Pveg is projected from the results from the β-galactosidase assay and was not measured with luminescence measurements. For the assays shown, an intermediate version of the reporter vector pSBBs3C-luxABCDE was used, which still contained one forbidden PstI site.
Sporobeads - what protein do you want to display?
Result of fluorescence evaluation of the three strains: W168, B53 and B70.
Erase* germination ability! Knockout strains
The germination rates of B. subtilis germination mutants. All germination rates are relative to wild type 168 (W168), our positive control. W168 showed near 100% germination rates. The mutant spo0A::tet is unable to form spores, and should therefore show no germination (our negative control). Our results were consistent with this expectation. Mutants used were:
W168: wild-type 168
spo0A::tet: a sporulation-deficient strain
B29: cwlD::kan, sleB::mls
B30: gerD::cm, sleB::mls
B32: cwlJ::spec, cwlD::kan
B40: cwlD::kan, sleB::mls, cwlJ::spec
B41: cwlD::kan, sleB::mls, gerD::cm
B42: cwlD::kan, cwlJ::spec, gerD::cm
B43: gerD::cm, sleB::mls, cwlJ::spec
B46: cwlD::kan, cwlJ::spec, gerD::cm, sleB::mls
B47: gerD::cm, sleB::mls, cwlJ::spec, cwlD::kan
*No germinating spores detected in 4.6x109 spores. For a full explanation of these great results, see All results .
Inverter works!
β-Galactosidase assay of Inverter with lacZα as reporter. The higher the arabinose concentration, the higher the translational repression of uofCGU-lacZα
