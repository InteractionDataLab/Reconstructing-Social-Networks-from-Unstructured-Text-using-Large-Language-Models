The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

Sporobeads - What Protein Do You Want to Display?
Sporobeads are the first generation of Bacillus subtilis endospores displaying a protein of our choice on their outermost layer, the spore crust. In future Sporobeads could serve as a platform for protein display and thus be used for numerous versatile applications . Our goal was to show that B. subtilis spores have the ability to do so. As a proof of principle we successfully fused GFP to the spore crust and obtained fluorescence with microscopy.
