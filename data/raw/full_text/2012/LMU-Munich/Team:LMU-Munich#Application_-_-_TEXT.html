The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

What are the potential advantages of using B. subtilis spores as functional bioparticals?
They are:
Very stable even under severe environmental conditions
Easy and cheap to produce in large quantities (check out the link to this commercial offer )
Part of human nutrition in terms of food supplements and generally regarded as safe
Moreover, our Sporobeads are:
Unable to proliferate and therefore most likely not treated as genetically modified organisms by the law
Our Sporobeads offer a wide variety of applications within the laboratory, and around the world. Sporobeads can be used for filtration and protein screening.
Filtration
