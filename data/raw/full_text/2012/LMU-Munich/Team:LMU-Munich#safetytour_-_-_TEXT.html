The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

Safety Aspect
The GerminationSTOP was put into place for the simple technical reason that the fusion proteins would lose their functions if the spore were to become a vegetative cell. But the GerminationSTOP also ensures that our Sporobeads are no longer able to germinate into viable cells.
In order to get a professional statement about the safety aspects of our project and how realistic it would be to release our spores into the environment, we invited the Commissioner for Bio-Safety in Bavaria to speak with us. In a two hour discussion, we explained the details of our projects and asked the Commissioner all of the "what ifs" on our minds.
