The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".
[ more news ]
Here we attribute work done by others and ourselves. We distinguish work done by the team from work done by others, including the Mascher Work Group (our host lab), LMU lab groups, advisors, instructors, graduate students, and postgraduate masters students.
Materials we have received from the Mascher research group:
- Bacillus subtilis WT strain W168
- gDNA from B. subtilis W168
- gDNA from B. lincheniformes
- Several plasmids Plasmids for Bacillus BioBrickBox : pDG148, pDG1716, pAC6, pDG1662, pAH328, pXT, pCSlux103, pAX01, plasmids as templates for resistance cassettes for gene knockouts : pGEMcat, pDG780, pDG647, pDG1726, pDG1513
- Several primers
- All main protocols how to work with B. subtilis
Support we have received from others:
- Introduction to fluorescence microscopy by the lab of Marc Bramkamp and some microscopy protocols. All pictures were taken by team members.
- Imamura et al. : We received plasmids from his work with the spore crust proteins that we can use as a positive control. The plasmids include cotZ-gfp and cgeA-rfp fusion proteins and a gfp, that is produced inside the spore.
- We used the experience and some materials from last year's LMU-Munich iGEM team for our highschool practical course.
- Sequencing from Dr. Andreas Brachmann
- We used plasmids from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center as template for our new backbone vectors .
- gDNA from E. coli K12 from AG K. Jung
- pRoufCGU-lacZ and pURyhB from AG Udo Bläsi
