The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".
[ more news ]
We are collaborating with the following iGEM teams (in alphabetical order):
Bielefeld : Bielefeld characterised several laccases to purify municipal and industrial wastewater from synthetic estrogens and other aromatic compounds. After the European Jamboree we realized that our Sporobeads could be a nice platform to immobilize their laccases. The team Bielefeld send us immediately their laccases and set up a quick protocol for us so that we can measure the activity. We probably won't be able to get it done before wiki freeze so you will find all the results in our presentation or after the Jamboree.
Groningen : The team from Groningen also works with B. subtilis. We sent them our new parts that we designed for our BacillusBioBrickBox . Groningen could directly use them for their cloning and we got some useful feedback about our parts. They successfully used our vector pSBBs1C.
TU Munich : We worked closely with the TU-Munich to implement the Munich SynBio Day . Because we are located in the same city, when we heard that the TU lost some important BioBricks from the Spring distribution in September, we gladly provided our aliquots to them, saving their team project time.
UCL : The UCL iGEM team, visited us in Munich during the CAS SynBio Conference . When the conference ended, they stayed one day longer to help us with modeling. This afforded us the opportunity to explain to the modelers from London our project in person so that they could think of potential ways to model our project.
Wageningen : iGEM Wageningen works on the modification of virus-like particles (VLPs) as interesting platforms for vaccine production and/or site-specific drug delivery. So both of us want to display proteins, Wageningen on their VLP, and our team on spores. We think about showing the functionality of both of our systems by binding the one to the other.
We are still looking for other teams that work with Bacillus subtilis to test our new BioBricks. Check our list of parts and email us (igem@bio.lmu.de) in case there are any helpful BioBricks for you.
