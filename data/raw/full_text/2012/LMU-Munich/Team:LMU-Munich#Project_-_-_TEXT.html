The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".
[ more news ]
Our project Beadzillus is composed of several modules. Click on the symbols to learn more about their function.  The idea of Beadzillus is to enrich the partsregistry with new BioBricks that are needed for the work with B. subtilis and show how its unique features lead to new creative ideas. We use the spores of B. subitlis to establish a platform for protein display.
Bacillus Intro : A short introduction to the organism Bacillus subtilis and why we chose to work with it.
Our BacillusBioBrickBox offers a set of new parts for the work with B. subtilis.
Sporobeads are a platform to display proteins on B. subtilis spores.
GerminationSTOP prevents the spores from germinating to vegetative cells.
On our Data page you find all our results in detail.
Why did we chose spores to display proteins and for what could they be used? See our Applications page .
