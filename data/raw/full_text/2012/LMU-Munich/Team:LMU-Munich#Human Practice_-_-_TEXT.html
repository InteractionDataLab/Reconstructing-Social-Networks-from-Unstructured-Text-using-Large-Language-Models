The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".
[ more news ]
For the Human Practice aspect of iGEM, we chose three approaches:
engaging with others involved in SynBio, including experts in the field and students like ourselves
teaching young biology students who have not yet learned about or had experience in SynBio
and bringing SynBio into the spotlight within our own city, in partnership with others around Germany
For descriptions of each component of our approach, please see the subsections of Human Practice:
