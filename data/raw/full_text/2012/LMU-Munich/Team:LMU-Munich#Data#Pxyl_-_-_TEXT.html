The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

Pxyl
Our Pxyl-expression vector cannot be transformed into B. subtilis; neither by us, nor by Groningen.

xylR-Pxyl could not be cloned in front of any reporter gene.
So no results on that side - apart from wrong digests and empty plates...
