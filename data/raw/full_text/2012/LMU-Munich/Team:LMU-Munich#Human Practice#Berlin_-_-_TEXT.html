Berlin Biotechnology Conference
Check out our poster
On June 28, 2012, the iGEM team attended the 3rd Annual Congress on Strategy Process titled "Biotechnologie2020+" in Berlin. The conference was sponsored by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research as an initiative to support development of next generation biotechnology. The conference was visited by approximately 200 stakeholders in academia, industry and government, including 11 German iGEM teams.
At the conference, the LMU-Munich iGEM team presented our poster, listened to talks by others in the field, and participated in brainstorming and creative workshops. Two of our team members, Jara and Jenny, were in the winning group of their creative workshop -- they had to generate an idea of how to rapidly earn support for clean water initiatives abroad. We also visited the posters and presentations of industrial entrepreneurs, learning what synthetic biology concepts are being employed at present, and what the challenges are of industrial application.
In the poster presentations, we got to discuss our ideas with experts, learn the projects of other German teams, and consider collaborations for our projects.
