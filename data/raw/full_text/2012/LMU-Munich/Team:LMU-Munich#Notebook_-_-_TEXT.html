The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

You should make use of the calendar feature on the wiki and start a lab notebook.  This may be looked at by the judges to see how your work progressed throughout the summer.  It is a very useful organizational tool as well.

We visited the Analytica, the 24th International fare for Laboratory Technology, Analysis and Biotechnology to learn about cutting edge technologies and to make a first contact with possible sponsors. We returned with a huge load of useful stuff for the lab, e.g. reaction tubes and racks, and pencils of course!
