The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

Crust Protein Genes Organization
The gene cgeA is located in the cgeABCDE cluster and is expressed from its own promoter PcgeA. The cluster cotVWXYZ contains the gene cotZ which is cotranscribed with cotY and expressed from the promoter PcotYZ. Another promoter of this cluster, PcotV, is responsible for the transcription of the other three genes (Fig. 2). Those three promoters were evaluated with the lux reporter genes ( pSBBs3C-luxABCDE ) to analyze their strength and the time point of their activation (see data ).
Fig. 2: Gene clusters of cotZ and cgeA
Based on this data, two of the three promoters could be used for expression of spore crust fusion proteins.
