Bacillus Vectors
We have generated a suite of BioBrick-compatible vectors: three empty insertional backbones with different antibiotic resistances and integration loci, two reporter and two expression vectors. Here is a list of all the vectors we cloned and used.

For the use of our vectors please see our Protocols page. A general introduction to Bacillus subtilis and its integrative vectors can be found here . All vectors have ampicillin as Escherichia coli resistance and RFP in the multiple cloning site as selection marker.
The corresponding vector maps:
The number in the vector's name codes for the insertion locus and the following letter for the Bacillus subtilis resistance gene according to the following table:

The concentrations of the antibiotics for selection of B.subtilis transformation and tests for plasmid insertion can be found in our Protocol section.
See here to find out how to use B. subtilis vectors. In this overview , the integration mechanism of B. subtilis vectors is described.
The design and special use of our Sporovector can be found here .
