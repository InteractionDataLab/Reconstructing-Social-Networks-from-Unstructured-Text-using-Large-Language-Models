Information for our Supporters
The Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (LMU) supports our team and our participation at the iGEM competition. Thus, the registration fees worth 5000€, a place in a lab and two advisors are provided by the university. However, the costs of traveling to the European Jamboree in Amsterdam and World Championship in Boston, as well as our lab materials are not covered. So get involved, support our team, and become a sponsor!
In return we will gladly promote your company throughout the whole competition -- from now on until November 2012.
Sponsoring Categories
The Platinum level sponsor will enjoy our complete gratitude in every possible way of promotion. In addition to the gold level acknowledgements, you will be presented as our main sponsor on every piece of media. We are glad to discuss special arrangements for further publicity.
Gold level sponsors will enjoy reaching high caliber professionals from around the world in a variety of high-profile demonstrations of gratitude, including large logo displays. In addition to the silver level acknowledgments below (even bigger logo), gold level sponsors will enjoy: being verbally named at the beginning of our presentation (+ slide), a logo in the corner of every presentation slide, a logo on our flyer of results, and a large logo on top of our poster. We can distribute company flyers at the Jamborees.
Silver level sponsors will reap the benefits of logo repetition and public acknowledgement in several settings. In addition to the bronze level acknowledgments below (but bigger logo), silver level sponsors will be verbally named in the final presentation, and have their logo on the bottom of our poster.
Bronze level sponsors will be thanked throughout each step of our work: via the website, as a logo on our t-shirts/hoodies worn by all team members and in our final presentation.
Both financial and material support is welcome.
