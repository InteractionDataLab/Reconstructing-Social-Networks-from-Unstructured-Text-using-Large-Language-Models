The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

Integrative vectors for Bacillus subtilis
All except for one vector that we provided to the registry for B. subtilis are integrative. They all insert into the genome via double homologous recombination at specific sites. Thereby, a target gene in B. subtilis is disrupted, which can be selected for by specific tests. The tests are part of our protocol "How to use Bacillus subtilis vectors" .
The following grafic shows how the integration works.
A: Bacillus subtilis vector
B: Linearisation with ScaI
C: Linearized vector
D: Linearized vector is transformed into B. subtilis
E: Double recombination of homologuos sequences
F: Final genotype
Integration of B. subtilis vector into the genome.
