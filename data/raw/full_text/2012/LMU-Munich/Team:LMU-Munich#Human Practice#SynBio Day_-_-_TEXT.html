The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

Germany-wide SynBio Day
See the press release from the LMU.
The Synthetic Biology Day is an initiative by all German iGEM teams. It is a public event with the intention of explaining and opening communication on the field of Synthetic Bilogy to the general public. It was held on August 25, 2012 in the following cities: Bielefeld, Darmstadt, Frankfurt, Freiburg, Göttingen, Marburg, Munich, Potsdam and Tübingen .
In collaboration with the TU Munich, we organized and participated in the SynBio Day activities for the city of Munich.
People that were interested could fill out a an easy quiz to check how much they know about Synthetic Biology. The quiz was a good opportunity to explain basic stuff about gene technology. Especially in Germany, people are very skeptical about everything that deals with GMOs. However, almost all people that took the time to listen to us what Synthetic Biologist aims to do, were excited about the possibilites and didn't express any fears.
Children could take part in a drawing contest. Every child draws a picture about an animal with an extra ability of a different animal.
We think that was a very good way to get to talk with people that normally wouldn't get in touch with Synthetic Biology.
