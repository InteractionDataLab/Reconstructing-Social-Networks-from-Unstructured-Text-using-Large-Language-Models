The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".
[ more news ]
We invited the commissioner for Bio-Safety in Bavaria. In a two hour discussion we explained the details about our projects and wanted to know all the "what ifs" that came to our mind. Most of the applications with our spores we thought of dealt with the filtration or degradation of molecules in water, blood or the human gut.
What regulations, laws or aspects do we need to keep in mind: - during construction of our spores... (antibiotic resistances, toxins,...)? - during purification of our spores?
Which laws apply for which application?
Is our spore a GMO?
The complete protocol of the meeting and the responses will follow!
