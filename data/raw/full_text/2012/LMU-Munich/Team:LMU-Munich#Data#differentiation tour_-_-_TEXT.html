The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

Overview on the life cycle of Bacillus subtilis
B. subtilis is able to differentiate into cells with different morphologies and functions (Fig.1). The most characteristic form is the endospore, which is produced under nutrient starvation. In our project, we will exploit the production of endospores. Because they are extremely stable, they are perfect vehicles for the display of functional fusion proteins on their surface as illustrated by our Sporobead module.
Fig. 1: The vegetative cycle is very similiar to the one of E. coli. But if there is a stress like for example starvation, the cells enter sporulation, where they first undergo a polar cell division, followed by the formation of the endospore. If the enviromental conditions are suitable again, the spore will then germinate and reenter the vegetative cycle.
