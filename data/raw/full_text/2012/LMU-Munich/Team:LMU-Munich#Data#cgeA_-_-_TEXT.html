The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

cgeA and PcgeA
cgeA turned out to contain an AgeI  site. After mutating that, the NotI from the prefix was dysfunctional due to the insertion of one nucleotide. After putting so much effort into such a small gene, it refused to be combined with any of our promoters, not to mention gene fusions with any of our reporter genes.
It should have been obvious that PcgeA is not better than the gene it regulates. It was not easy to clone this promoter into pSBBs3C-luxABCDE, but when it was finally transformed into B. subtilis, it revealed no activity.
It's needless to say, that of course we had the combination of cgeA with exactly that non-functional promoter.
To complete our confusion, the promoter still seemed to work in combination with the Sporobead construction. Weak, but worked....
