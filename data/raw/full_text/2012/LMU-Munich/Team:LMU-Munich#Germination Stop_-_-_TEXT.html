The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

GerminationSTOP
The goal of this module was to yield  Sporobeads which are safe (unable to germinate) and consistently functional (maintain their spore shape and structure throughout time). To achieve this, we sought to remove the germination capability of our spores, while keeping their necessary structural functions intact.
Gene Knockouts
We picked important germination genes and knocked them out. Subsequently we combined the single mutants into quadruple mutants and successfully prevented germination.
Suicideswitch
In case of germination gene knockout failure, we invented the suicide switch. If spores still germinate, the production of a toxin leads to immediate cell death.
