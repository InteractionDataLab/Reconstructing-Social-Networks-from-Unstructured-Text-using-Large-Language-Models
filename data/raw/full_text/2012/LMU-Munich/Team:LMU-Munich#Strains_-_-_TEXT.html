The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

Because we envision an iGEM world where work with Bacillus subtilis is as easy as work with Escherichia coli, we offer the last piece of the puzzle. Until now, there has been no possibility of exchanging Bacillus subtilis strains through the Parts Registry. However, for work with B. subtilis, the option to exchange and work with different strains is much more important than it is with E. coli because:
Mostly integrative plasmids were used. Hence, the storage of the plasmids is less important than the strains.
These genetic modifications can be easily transferred to other strains by isolation and transformation of genomic DNA
To facilitate an easy storage and exchange of relevant B. subtilis strains, the Mascher lab offers to maintain an iGEM Bacillus subtilis strain collection for the time being. By clicking on the picture below, you can download an Excel spread sheet summarizing all B. subtilis strains currently available in this collection. So far, this is limited to the strains constructed by the LMU-Munich iGEM team 2012 as part of their Beadzillus project.
If you would like to request a strain or contribute to the Bacillus subtilis collection by providing novel strains, please contact Prof. Thorsten Mascher .
