CAS SynBio Conference
Check out our poster
For July 23-25, the LMU’s Center for Advanced Studies ( CAS ) organized the 2012 Synthetic Biology Conference here at the LMU Bio-Center.
In conjuncture with this conference, our team invited several teams from Germany and Europe to attend the conference, and to participate in specially organized iGEM activities. We coordinated with the CAS organizers to create a special section within the conference for iGEM participants to present posters of their work, and to receive significantly discounted admission.
The conference was an especially valuable opportunity for teams to discuss their ideas and work with experts in the syn-bio field. Jay Keasling was one of many notable speakers who took time to converse with iGEM teams. Additionally, the conference offered teams the chance to exchange information with in person, and discuss collaborations. Of course, such a meeting would not be complete without some time spent getting to know one another, and as such, we guided the group to the Einkehr zur Fürstenrieder Schwaige, a local beer garden. There we shared laughs, stories, and cheers.
The list of speakers and conference program can be found here .
In addition to the LMU Munich team, the teams that participated in the CAS Synthetic Biology Conference are:
Bielefeld

Darmstadt
Heidelberg_LSL (High School division)
London (UCL)
