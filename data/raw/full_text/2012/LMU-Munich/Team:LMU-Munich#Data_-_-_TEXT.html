The LMU-Munich team is exuberantly happy about the great success at the World Championship Jamboree in Boston. Our project Beadzillus finished 4th and won the prize for the "Best Wiki" (with Slovenia) and "Best New Application Project".

BacillusBioBrickBox
Evaluation of B. subtilis vectors
Seven novel vectors were constructed and four already proven to work in B. subtilis.
Anderson Promoter Evaluation
Eleven Anderson promoters were measured in B. subtilis and showed relatively weak activity.
Constitutive Bacillus Promoters
Three novel B. subtilis promoter BioBricks (PliaG, Pveg, PlepA) were constructed and functionality verified by luminescence and β-galactosidase assays.
Inducible Bacillus Promoters
A novel antibiotic-inducible promoter, PliaI, was constructed and thoroughly evaluated.
Sporobeads
Crust Promoter Evaluation
Three sporulation-dependent promoters (PcotYZ, PcotV, PcgeA) were constructed, two of which show the expected behavior.
GFP-Sporobead Evaluation
They glow! GFP was successfully displayed on the spore crust as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy.
Sporobead Purification
We compared different ways of purifying Bacillus spores from vegetative cells: Lysozyme is the best!
GerminationSTOP
Knockouts of germination genes
We successfully prevented spore germination by multiple gene knockouts.
SuicideSwitch
Death upon germination: We developed a novel safety strategy as a back-up to the gene knockouts.
Inverter
β-galactosidase assay of Inverter with lacZα
It works! Invert the output of your promoter of choice.
Trashcan
Things that were a pain in the neck!
cgeA and PcgeA
Unexpected restriction sites combined with no activity at all - what a bummer!
MazF
The story of trying to clone a toxin from E. coli in E. coli: They die, dammit! (...not a surprise, really...)
Xylose promoters
All constructs involving xylose-inducible promoters refused cloning or evaluation (sorry, Groningen...!).
