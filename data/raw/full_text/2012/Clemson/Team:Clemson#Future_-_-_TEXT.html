Introduction
Biosurfactant - Rhamnolipid
PCB Degradation
Future Directions
Future Directions
     For this year’s competition, we were unable to complete all of our intended goals for this system. We were unable to acquire an appropriate PCB specific promoter to use with our gene arrays, nor implement the guider system into magnetotactic bacteria. In the years to come, we will optimize this guider system as well as functionalize our biosurfactant and PCB degradation pathways. The biosurfactant system and the majority of the PCB degradation genes were synthesized. However, tests must still be conducted to evaluate the expression levels for each component. Despite the large amount of work that has yet to be done, the future for this project seems quite optimistic and maybe sometime in the future Lake Hartwell will be rid of its PCB contamination.
