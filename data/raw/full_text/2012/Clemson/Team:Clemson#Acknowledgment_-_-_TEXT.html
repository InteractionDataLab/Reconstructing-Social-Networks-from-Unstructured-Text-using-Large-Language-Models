The project design, planning, and all of the lab work shown in the team notebook was performed by Clemson iGEM team undergraduate members.
Aaron Brown, the graduate student advisor, gave guidance in primer design, PCR, cloning, and experimental design. He led the team and involved them in all processes.
We would also like to thank Samarth Shah, computer science graduate student at Clemson University, for wiki page design and coding, and all the time and efforts he had committed to complete the wiki pages.
We would like to thank the 2011 Team UT-Tokyo for their design of the SMART E. coli system which we built on and included in our own model system.
We'd like to thank Clemson University Department of Biological Sciences for all kinds of support (including funds and lab space).
We'd like to thank all of our sponsors for their generous support.
