Auxin detection
Overview
Now that we’ve managed to model auxin creation and transport, you may be asking yourself ; great, those guys have done all those models, but how can we link it to what we see ? That’s the aim of this model that will link the quantity of auxin transported into the cell to GFP degradation that we can observe in our tadpole’s cells. As for us, this model will also help our biologists to find the conditions upon which the reception can work and the help them guess the reasons of possible dysfunction in the auxin reception.  Very schematically, this is what's happening during auxin detection:
Figure 1. Kinetic squeme depicting the auxin detection model in the cell.
Once TIR and GFP are produced and auxin has entered the cell, it binds with TIR and then this complex degrades GFP. This is what we're going to model.
Assumptions
In these reactions, we assimilate the complex Auxin-TIR to an enzyme that is able to degrade the GFP. Auxin would then be its activator.
The degradation rate of GFP is negligible; indeed a molecule of GFP takes 72 hours to degrade normally, whereas during auxin detection the complex auxin-TIR degrades it in less than an hour.
The Tir protein is continuously produced and degraded in the cell,
Model Description
Equations
where:
tir1: open reading frame encoding the protein TIR1 coming from the plantOryza sativa
gfp-aid-nls: open reading frame encoding the protein GFP fused to auxin-inducible degron (AID) system followed by an SV40 nuclear localization signal
mRNA-TIR1: mRNA coding the protein TIR1
mRNA-GFP-AID-NLS: mRNA coding the fused protein GFP-AID-NLS
TIR1: F-box transport inhibitor response 1 protein
GFP-AID: Green fluorescence protein fused to auxin-inducible degron system
degGFP-AID: degraded green fluorescence protein fused to auxin-inducible degron system
dIAA: diffused indole-3-acetic acid (auxin)
IAA: Indole-3-acetic acid or auxin
