Week 4: 2nd July - 8th July
Monday, 2nd July
T10 bacteria transformation with DNA ligated on Friday (29/06)- protocol as before
Transformed bacteria spreaded on Petri's plate- LB-agar-ampiciline- incubation 37 degrees Celsius, overnight
SOC preparation:
1,4g Hanahan's Broth
0,18g Glucose
50mL MiliQ water
filtrated on microfilter (if you have more important volume, autoclave it)
Tuesday, 3rd July
Designing starters
Weekly team meeting- discussion about work organization
Wednesday, 4th July
Gel electrophoresis of DNA digests (from 28.06.) followed by cutting-of bands of interests (pCS2+ plasmid and XFP plasmids)
Gel-extraction (Kit used: QIA quick gel extraction) followed by nano-drop measurements in order to get information about DNA concentration.
Result: very low quantity of DNA. We realized that quantity of DNA used for digestion was too low (less than 2 micrograms of DNA/sample).
DNA Digestion (of pCS2+, CFP, RFP, GFP, YFP). Protocol(Final volume of sample: 30 uL):
3 uL Buffer 10x (choose a right buffer for each enzyme you use)
1 uL Restriction Enzyme 1
1 uL Restriction Enzyme 2
2 ug DNA (calculate the volume which you need to add, depends of the DNA concentration)
c uL ddH2O (fill till 30 uL)
Incubation 3h at 37 degrees
Thursday, 5th July
Gel Extraction 1:
Excise the DNA fragment from agarose gel
Weight the gel slice
Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of gel (100 mg = 100 uL)

Incubate at 50 degrees Celsius for 10 min to dissolve the gel
Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix
Apply the sample to the QIAquick column to bond DNA
Centrifuge at 13 000 rpm for 1 min and discard flow-through
Add 500 uL of Buffer QG to the column
Centrifuge at 13 000 rpm for 1 min and discard flow-through
To wash, add 750 uL of Buffer PE
Centrifuge at 13 000 rpm for 1 min and discard flow-through
Centrifuge the column again at 13 000 rpm for 1 min and place the column in a clean 1.5 mL tube
Add 50 uL of Buffer EB to elute DNA
Check DNA concentration with Nanodrop

But: Concentrations are really low => Need to optimize the protocol and make a new gel migration.
Gel Migration:
Gel at 0,08%

Protocole modification: Elution in two times 25 uL with water RNAse free instead of EB buffer.
