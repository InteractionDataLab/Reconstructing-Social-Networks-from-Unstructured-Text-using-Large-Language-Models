Tadpole's surfaces calculation
The tadpole shape is approximated by a cone and a sphere.
Surface of the exterior of the tail
Surface of the exterior of the head
Surface of the tadpole
This would represent the exchange surface between the tadpole and his environment via the skin.
Surface of the interior of the tail
Surface of the interior of the head
Surface of the interior of skin
This would represent the exchange surface between the skin and the blood, as supposing that the capillaries cover all the interior surface of the skin.
Surface of the blood or surface of the receptor
To estimate this blood-receptor exchange surface, we simplified the blood circulation map to a cylindre contains the all volume of the blood. The diameter of this cylindre is the mean between the artery diameter and the capillairy diameter.
The raduis so is r=16.75 x10-4
