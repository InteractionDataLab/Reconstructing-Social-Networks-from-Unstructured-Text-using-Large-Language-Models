Tadpole's volume calculation
The tadpole shape is approximated by a cone and a sphere.
Volume of the tail
rb = 0.035cm
H = 0.8cm
Volume of the head
rh = 0.3cm
Volume of the tadpole
Volume of the skin
To compute the volume of the skin we do the difference between the external and internal sphere/cone.  Tskin = 35 * 10-4 cm  First the volume for the skin in the head:
Then the volume for the skin in the tail:
Finally the whole tadpole skin volume:
Volume of the blood
According to a study published in the article "The Blood-Volume of Cold-Blooded Animals as Determined by Experiments Upon Frogs and Lizards", the average volume of blood in a frog in cubic centimetre is equal to 4.61% of its masse in grammes.  We took the same percentage for a tadpole. For the masse, we mesured mg=1mg for a wet-weighed 5-days tadpole.
Volume of the receptor
We considered the receptor as any tissue which can recept the auxin via the blood except the skin.
