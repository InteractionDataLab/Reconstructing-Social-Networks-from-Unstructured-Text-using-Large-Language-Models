Gregoire Lejay Contact
Freelance designer
After a master in bioinformatics and modeling, I started a research project in which I use mathematical models and computer simulations to study vision in Drosophila. At the same time, I'm involved in many different projects that bring in several aspects of design, art and science. I enjoy the self-taught approach of science and technology thus I joined groups of DIY enthusiasts such as La Paillasse with which I participate for the biotic games project. My goal is to find mechanisms that will enable us to involve tadpoles in a gameplay environment for the biotic game project.
Erwann Le Rouzic Contact
Student in Game Design at ISART Digital
I’m a sophomore in Game Design at Isart Digital. I love creating new and original ways to entertain players that’s why I am part of this project. For the first time I’ll be able to think about a game interacting with biology and also work with scientists, which is completely different from our usual way to work.
Anthony Pigeot Contact
Student in Game Design at ISART Digital
I am a game developer who loves new ways to play games, especially using the web and portable devices and this is why I currently study at ISART Digital, in Game Design & Programming, a course focused on game development. I love creating games, and I do that as much as I can on my spare time. I also like original experiences which try to add new ways of interacting to objects that usually aren't. It's been a while now that I have been interested in the way we can interact with biology thanks to computer science. That is why I am interested in the biotic game project which is a surprising and exciting way of creating games, and probably a nice opportunity to learn new things. Learning is cool.
Thibault Laisney Contact
Student in Game Design at ISART Digital
After two years in law school, I started to learn computer science during three years with a DUT Informatique and a Licence Informatique. I am currently in a web development company and I study Game Design & Programming at ISART Digital. I want to become a game developer specialized on mobile platform and web plateform. I really enjoy to create games for casual gamers in order to transform them into Harcore gamers.
