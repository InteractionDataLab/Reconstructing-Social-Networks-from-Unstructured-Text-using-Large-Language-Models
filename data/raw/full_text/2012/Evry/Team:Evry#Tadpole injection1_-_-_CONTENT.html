	</LI>Number of Plasmids injected: ~ 4.37E+7 </OL><H2>Conclusion</H2><P>
Our constructions were expressed in embryos and then in tadpoles. Presented BioBrick parts are considered as characterized. Nevertheless we expected an uniform expression of reporter with the CMV promoter. Colors fluorescent proteins were expressed in different tissue, one tadpole expresses the colors fluorescent protein in one to four different tissues, and tissue are different between tadpoles. 
Hypothesis: The plasmid does not diffuse in the egg and stay in the same area, it means that depending on the injection area the plasmid would be in a part of the tadpole. This question was raised in our <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Evry/plasmid_splitting">model</A>. Another reason could be that the metabolism of Each tissue specific cell is different and change during the tadpole's development. 
More experiments needs to be conducted to confirm that we showed the tissue specificity of the elastase promoter (pancreas). Four different reporters were characterized: mCitrine, CFP, sfGFP and the fused protein GFP-aid.
Moreover the expression of reporters decreases throughout time, because plasmids are damaged throughout times but also because plasmids are shared between more cells and the quantity of plasmids decreases for each cell.</P><H2>Plasmid injection results</H2><OL><H2 id="ElaGFP" class="ania">pCS2+ Elastase/sfGFP</H2>
	Tadpoles are at stage 47. Their size is near 5 mm.
	<P>We can see a sfGFP expression in a region close to the intestine and the biliar vesicle, and it is not auto-fluorescence. We suspect it to be the pancreas but as it is small in the tadpole it is not easy to testify. This injection will be done again in order to confirm our results.</P><H2 id="GFPaid" class="ania">pCS2+ GFP-aid</H2><H3 id="24hours">24h after injection</H3>

		Embryos are at <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Evry/Stages">stage 34-38</A> and move by intermittence, the size of tadpoles is near 2.5 mm<P>Despite a constitutive promoter in the plasmid (CMV), the expression of GFP-aid is localized in different tissues for each tadpole. We can hipothesize that the plasmids do not diffuse in the eggs because of the vitellus viscosity. This question was raised in one of the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Evry/plasmid_splitting">modelling part.</A></P><H3>3 days after injection</H3>Embryos are at <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Evry/Stages">stage 41-42</A>.

For instance in the tadpole on the left picture, bones in the tail produced GFP; on the right picture the GFP expression is localized in the skin. In this animation the only part of the tadpole moving is the heart beatting (between the head and the stomac).</P><P>The expression of GFP-aid is localized in different tissues for each tadpole, like the day before.

Plasmids may be damaged by cells, and/or the quantity of plasmids may have decrease in each cells which involded the diminution of GFP in each cells, after that it is more difficult to see GFP.

	The expression of mCitrine is localized in tail's muscles.

	</P></OL><H2>Messenger RNA injection</H2><P><I>Xenopus</I> embryos were injected with mRNA, obtained from <I>in-vitro</I> transcription of our frog plasmid using a commercial kit.</P><P>We can see a strong expression of GFP in all tissues, proving that our <I>in-vitro</I> transcription primer works. This debugging tool can be used when no expression is visible in the tadpole: It allows to be certain that the problem does not come from transcription. If RNA is injected and no activity is observed, then the bug is probably due to problems downstream of transcription (no translation, rapid degradation or incorrect protein folding for example). 
		</P><P>We can note that the green fluorescence is much better spread throughout the embryo than it is with DNA. This is because the messenger RNA diffuses much better throughout the <I>Xenopus</I> embryo.
