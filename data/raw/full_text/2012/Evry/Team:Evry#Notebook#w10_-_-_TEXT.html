Week 10: 13th August - 19th August
Monday, 13th August
Tadpoles injection (pNHK60)
Preparation of pNHK60 dilution(phenol/chloro extraction of Friday, 10th August)
Tube A12 (50ng/ul): 1,695ul A11 + 73,305ul H2Odd
Tube A13 (25ng/ul): 25ul A12 + 25ul H2Odd
PCR
TirI
Primers: P1 and P2
ADN: TirI-PCR P2-P36 (08.08) + TirI PCR P1-P4 (10.08)
pCS2+
Primers: P7+P8
ADN:A1
=> These PCR didn't work
New PCR
-TirI + P1-P4 with or without DMSO
-TirI + P2-P36 with or without DMSO
-pCS2+ mCherry + P7-P8
-pCS2+ TC + P7-P8
Cloning pSB1C3/IRES, pSB1C3/IaaM, pSB1C3/IaaH, pCS2+/IaaH (to biobrick pCS2+)
Restriction with EcoRI and PstI for pSB1C3 (K515100) then gel extraction of the backbone
Restriction with EcoRI and PstI for product of PCR: IRES, IaaH, IaaM and pCS2+ then purification with PCR clean up kit
Then ligation of pCS2+ with IaaH, pSB1C3 with IRES, pSB1C3 with IaaM and pSB1C3 with IaaH
Injection of pNHK60 into Xenopus eggs
Directly after fertilization of xenopus tropicalis eggs: injection of pNHK60 (plasmid with Tir1 and GFP-aid)
The production of GFP is expected into eggs
Transformation into Top10 E. coli
10ul sample + 50ul competent cells 250ul SOC medium pSB1C3/IRES
pSB1C3/IaaM
pSB1C3/IaaH
pSB1C3/IaaH-IRES
pCS2+/IaaH
pCS2+/IRES
Plates
pSB1C3 chloramphenicol resistant
pCS2+ ampicillin resistant
Tuesday, 14th August
Colony PCR
Positive Top 10 colonies:
pSB1C3/IRES
pSB1C3/IaaH-IRES
-> the result of the colony PCR is not as expected, IRES and IaaH are not present in pSB1C3
Thursday, 16th August
PCR
IaaH with primers 34 and 20, IaaM with primers 35 and 22, IRES with primers 31 and 32
Tir I "mega" PCR: with Tir I P1-P4 and TirI P2-P36 PCR products + P1 and P2 primers

T4 ligase 1ul
Ligation pSC2+/IaaH
H2Odd 7,49ul
Buffer 1,5ul
pSC2+ 3,91ul
IaaH 1,1ul ==> no more material so 0,5ul
