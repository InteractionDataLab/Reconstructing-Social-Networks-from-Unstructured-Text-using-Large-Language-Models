From 2012.igem.org
What we did today:
1) Gel electrophoresis of DNA digests (from 28.06.)
followed by cutting-of bands of interests (pCS2+ plasmid and XFP plasmids)
2) Gel-extraction (Kit used: QIA quick gel extraction) followed by nano-drop measurements in order to get information about DNA concentration.
Result: very low quantity of DNA. We realized that quantity of DNA used for digestion was too low (less than 2 micrograms of DNA/sample).
3) DNA Digestion (of pCS2+, CFP, RFP, GFP, YFP). Protocol:
Final volume of sample: 30 uL
3 uL Buffer 10x (choose a right buffer for each enzyme you use)
1 uL Restriction Enzyme 1
1 uL Restriction Enzyme 2
2 ug DNA (calculate the volume which you need to add, depends of the DNA concentration)
c uL ddH2O (fill till 30 uL)
Incubation 3h at 37 degrees
