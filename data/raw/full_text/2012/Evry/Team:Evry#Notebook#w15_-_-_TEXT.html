Week 15: 17th September - 23rd September
this week we have worked to characterize Promotors and Reporters in order to test their validity by injection in tadpoles :
biobricking promotors in Pcs2+ which are then to be characterized in tadpoles after cloning upstream to various reporters including mCFP, SfGFP, and citrine which are:
P Elastase
Hsp70
P Car A
FLk1
P CMV
this work included standard PCR amplification, purification , plasmid digestion, ligation of vector-insert, transformation, miniprepping, and sequencing.
following that  cloning the reporters downstream to various promotors was done
cloning og IAAh and IAAM in both Psb1C3 and Pcs2+  by standard biobrick portocol
Golden gate assembly of IAAM-IAAH cassette in both Psb1C3 and Pcs2+
Injection in tadpoles for the parts we managed to clone and was validated correctly by sequencing
