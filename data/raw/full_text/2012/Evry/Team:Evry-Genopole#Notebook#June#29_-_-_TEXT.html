Promoters & Reporters workgroup
Gel migration
Gel preparation
25mL agarose+TAE (frigo) + 2microL BET
Sample preparation
DNA Ladder 1kB: 1microL ladder + 1microL loading buffer + 4microL ddH2O
Digested RFP, YFP, CFP, GFP, pCS2+ (from 28 june) : 10microL sample + 2microL loading buffer
=> 100V, 1h
Result:no DNA detectable, Solution: to redo the step of digestion with more DNA
DNA digestion under construction
4ul of CFP, GFP, RFP, YFP dosed on 28 june
3ul of pSC2+ dosed on 28 june
Gel migration
Gel preparation
50mL agarose+TAE (frigo) + 4ul BET
