Introduction
Dear visitor, welcome to the French Froggies project Homepage. This year, the Evry iGEM team pushed farther away the frontiers of synthetic biology bringing the frog as a new chassis for the iGEM competition. We have developed and characterized the first parts for Xenopus, providing new tools for modeling the physiology of the animal and constructed a synthetic hormonal system in a multicellular organism.
