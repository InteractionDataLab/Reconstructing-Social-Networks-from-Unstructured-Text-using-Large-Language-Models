A multidisciplinary and complementary team
The members of the team come from different formations:
- Evry university, Master mSSB (Synthetic and systemic biology)
- Versailles Saint Quentin university
- Paris Pantheon university (Philosophy)
- Ecole Normale Supérieure
- Ecole Centrale Paris (Engineering)
- Sup'Biotech Paris (Biotechnology)
- ESIEE Management (Biotechnology)
- Télécom Sud Paris (Computer Science & managment)
- Epita (Computer Science)
Our environment: a key location for synthetic biology in France
The Institute of Systems and Synthetic Biology (iSSB):
iSSB is located on the Genopole® in Evry, host team in the summer. The iSSB is a laboratory at the University of Evry and CNRS, supported by Genopole®. It is a multidisciplinary environment or collaborate physicists, chemists, computer scientists and biologists. It is also the laboratory who founded and directs the Master 2 Systems Biology Synthetic and MSSB. This master of avant-garde, unique in France, offers courses provided by researchers at the forefront of their field, which guaranteed training in the state of the art techniques used in synthetic biology.

Advisors
Pablo Carbonell
Associate researcher at the University of Evry
Computational biology  coordinator of the team BioRetroSynth from iSSB
He is professor of mSSB and has his ability to supervise research. He has extensive experience in computer modeling in biology (PhD at the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, a postdoc at the Polytechnic Institute of New York).
Anna Mlynarczyk
Doctoral student in proteomics (first year) at the university of Evry
She obtained a Master in Biotechnology at the University of Technology Westpomeranian of Szczecin in Poland. During her university studies she has conducted several training courses abroad (UEVE, TEPAK Cyprus) and Poland which made ​​her want to do research. Anna also performs the tutoring, which allows her to develop teaching skills.
Cyrille Pauthenier
Student of the Ecole Normale Supérieure and member of mSSB
Former member the 2011 iGEM Paris-Bettencourt team who was a finalist and won the prize for best presentation at the European semi-final, then was in the top 16 in the final at MIT. He is now starting a PhD in metabolic engineering at Jean-Loup Faulon's laboratory.
Instructors
Pr. Alfonso Jaramillo Contact
Team director of the Bio-Synth of iSSB
After a doctorate in theoretical physics, he was converted into synthetic biology for over 10 years. He gained international recognition in this field. It is now the team director of the Bio-Synth iSSB, working on the design, synthesis and characterization of biological regulatory artificial pathways. It is also one of the main teachers of mSSB. Alfonso Jaramillo will be the main iGEM team supervisor Evry-Genopole. He led iGEM team in Valencia in 2006, and participated in the supervision teams from Valencia and Paris.
Dr Andrew Tolonen Contact
Researcher at Genoscope in Evry
After a PhD in genetics and genomics of cyanobacteria at MIT and a post-doc in the team of George Church at Harvard, one of the largest synthetic biology laboratories in the world, he is now a researcher at Genoscope in Evry. His work focuses on the manufacture of biofuels by cyanobacteria. Andrew Tolonen attends the iGEM team Evry-Genopole in the selection and construction of the project. He participated in the supervision of Harvard iGEM teams during his post-doctorate.
Thomas Landrain Contact
Doctoral student at iSSB
Ex-student of the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, he is now a doctoral thesis at iSSB where he developed new technologies, based on the dynamics of RNA, for re-programming and display of gene expression in bacteria. He is also the co-founder and president of the first laboratory for the biotechnology community in France, "La Paillasse". In 2007, he was one of the initiators and participants of the first iGEM team that French was a finalist in the competition and won first prize for basic research.
