Xenopus for dummies: an iGEMer guidebook
Hi iGEMer! Are you brainstorming on a new project? Do you plan to work collaborate with Xenopus? You are at the good place, this book is dedicated for you.
We are the 2012 Evry iGEM team, and this year, we have made the first iGEM project on Xenopus and created the first biobricks to work with. In this small book, we wanted to share with you our experience with this animal, try to give you guidelines for designing your own project and give you references to the resources you can use.
You can download it in the PDF format!
