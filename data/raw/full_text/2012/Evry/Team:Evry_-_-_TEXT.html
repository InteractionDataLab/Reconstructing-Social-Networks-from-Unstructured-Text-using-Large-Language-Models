From 2012.igem.org
Welcome ot iGEM Evry's Wiki!
Welcome to the French Froggies Home Page!
This year, the Evry iGEM team is bringing synthetic biology to multicellular organisms, opening the era of synthetic physiology. We created the first parts for Xenopus and an synthetic orthogonal hormonal system to link them together. We also created new tools for modeling the tadpole physiology, assemble multiple parts in a single shot, wrote a guidebook to help future teams with Xenopus and studied the consequences of the arrival of vertebrates in iGEM.
