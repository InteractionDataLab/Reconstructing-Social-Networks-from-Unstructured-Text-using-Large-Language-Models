Auxin toxicity test in tadpoles
The purpose of this experiment
Before testing hormonal system in embryos (see here ), we conducted auxin toxicity test. Auxin concentrations used were 500, 250, 125 and 0 µM dissolved in MMR, with renewal of the medium each morning. (see medium preparation here )
Result interpretation:
The survival rate of embryos in both 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were observed in triplicate during three days of experiment.
As a control sample, embryos were placed in MMR 0.1x medium without an auxin.
The initial number of embryos for each medium condition was superior than 40.
The embryo's mortality rate was about:
for NAA 23% for day 1 (D1) and 45% for day 2 (D2)
for IAA 20% for D1 and 51% for D2
However embryos mortality depends not only on the auxin presence in media, but also on the rearing conditions, frequency of sorting dead and live embryos and media's changing. Usually the normal mortality ratio is no bigger than 30%.
We are aware that our experiment should be repeated to calculate the error deviation. But even without this data we confirmed our hypothesis that presence of auxin in MMR medium is not toxic for embryos and it doesn't cause any morphological abnormalities.
Data:
Control sample- embryos in MMR medium
Embryos in MMR medium with 250µM NAA
