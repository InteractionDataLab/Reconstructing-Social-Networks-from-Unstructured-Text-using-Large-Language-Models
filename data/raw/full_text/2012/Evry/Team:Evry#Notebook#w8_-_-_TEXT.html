Week 8: 30th July - 5th August
Monday, 30th July
Digestion - Ligation - Transformation:
Digestion of psc2+ and mRFP with EcoRI and PstI.
Ligation and Transformation on T10.
TirI BB
Electrophoresis of TirI last PCR: failure of this technique.
We buy a new primer to try another PCR technic.
Tuesday, 31st July
Inoculation:
Inoculation of pcs2+ (27.07) and repiquage of psc2+ with RFP (30.07)
Inoculation of psB1C3 with GFP-AID TirI: Electrophoresis of 27/07 results: Failure of second PCR We restart the first step
Thursday, 2nd August
Sequencing
Send pCS2+ to sequencing.
Issue
We found that pCS2+ was badly made. We restart the construction of this plasmid from the beginning.
Friday, 3nd August
Construction pCS2+ biobricked:
PCR pCS2+ Biobricked   Result gel:
1) is PCR products with template pCS2+, primers P7 and P8    and  2) to 6) are ladders test
Then the PCR product pCS2+ was purified with kit, digested with EcoRI and PstI then purified with PCR cleanup kit.
Plasmid TSO 28.06 mRFP (plasmid from plate 1-18F, mRFP)was cut with EcoRI and PstI:  after electrophoresis no band visible, 7 microL of plasmid used in a total volume of 25 microL.
