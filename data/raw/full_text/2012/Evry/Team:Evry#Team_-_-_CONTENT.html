La Paillasse is a physical and web platform for citizen scientists, amateur biologists, researchers and entrepreneurs that fosters open-science, debates and hands-on practice of Biotechnology. La Paillasse is also the first and largest community laboratory for Biotech in France. This year, La Paillasse and some of its members are joining the team of Evry to participate in the design and the realization of one of the coolest iGEM project ever: The french froggies. During the summer, La Paillasse have hosted and organized meet-ups between citizens and the iGEM team for explaining the stakes of our iGEM projects and of Synthetic Biology in general.

        I did my bachelor at Evry’s University, in Bioinformatics. During that year when Jean-loup Faulon presented iGem and synthetic biology, I found it very interesting. I wanted to participate with iGem from my bachelor. Because no team existed yet close to our university, William and I decided to create this team in November and we looked for interested people, funding and projects. I am very excited to be involved in this project with this wonderful team.

        I’m a bachelor graduated student from a Parisian engineering school. I look forward to a Master degree in biotechnology. I discovered synthetic biology mainly through conferences and I’ve been immediately fascinated by this new biological approach to work on living systems. iGEM is a good opportunity for me to start in this field and to acquire experience for my future engineering carrier.

        Having acquired a background in biology and a first year of master in “Genomics, Cells, Development and Evolution” at the University of Paris Sud 11, I started to be interested in systems biology since my last year of bachelor and decided on getting involved in this approach during both my second year of master and my master’s thesis. I am participating in the iGEM competition as it allows me to combine experimental work with theoretical modelling. I am keen to learn not only different biological techniques and modeling approaches but also to learn from my teammates and other iGEM teams.

        After a BTS in Biotechnology, I went to Sup'Biotech, an engineering school in Biotechnology. For 6 years, I have been studying DNA manipulation, bacteria transformation... but it is only recently that I have heard about Synthetic Biology. It is such a promising and interesting field but requires multidisciplinary skills. I am eager to increase my knowledge to be able to work at the interface of biology and computer science. I discovered iGEM thanks to the 2009 Sup'Biotech team and I have no doubt it will be a great opportunity to learn more, gain experience and hopefully bring a modest contribution to Synthetic Biology.

        I did my bachelor in Edinburgh university, and came into contact with
synthetic biology when I participated iGem with the 2010 Edinburgh team. My background is mostly molecular microbiology and biotechnology, but during iGEM I came into contact with modelling and how it could serve biology, thanks to the great modellers in our team. I decided to participate in mSSB in order to learn some more about modelling and programming so I could work more closely with computer people later :)

        I’m currently in my final year at Sup'Biotech Paris, a school of biotechnology, and my professional aim is to work on bioproduction processes. I’ve been attracted, since I was young, by all the possibilities of DNA manipulation and discovered synthetic biology with the first synthetic bacteria. Why did I join iGEM? It's a unique chance to participate in a challenging and concrete project.

        I'm in my fourth year at Sup'Biotech, an engeenering school in biotechnologies. Like many others, I have been amazed by the controversy surrounding the publication of Craig Venter and his synthetic bacterium &quot;Synthia&quot;. Since then, I am very interested to acquire expertise in this field and the iGEM competition is a chance for me to be part of this new science.

        I've currently finished my license (Bachelor) in biotechnology and I'm about to join the AIV (Interdisciplinary approaches to life science) Masters. I discovered synthetic biology with the Craig Venter's paper (released in may 2010). After that, my school gave me a 5 month research &amp; information processing project on synthetic biology. Through this project I've discovered the iGEM competition and the opportunities surrounding the emergence of this science filed. Enrolling in an iGEM team will give me a sight of how synthetic biology experimentations are, and also, to work with people who are interested in this science too.

For many years interested in the relation between maths and biology, I discovered synthetic biology in 2011 through its connection to systems biology and immediately got &quot;infected&quot;.

since high school and more especially in the links between biological
systems and my speciality: computer science. After all a cell can be
seen as a kind of computer, as seen in the name &quot;genetic code&quot;. I learned about the IGEM comptetition when I discovered the synthetic biology field in an article in Nature a few years ago. Since then I
wanted to participate to the comptetition but never had the
opportunity. I bring to the team my programming and engineering skills and hope to
learn a lot from biologist in the lab.

I'm completing a master of philosophy of science at Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University. I discovered synthetic biology about two years ago in a popular scientific review and was struck by the ambition of the field and the diversity of disciplines involved in it. I was seduced by the special place that laboratories such as Synberc give to social sciences and started thinking about some epistemological questions that could be raised by Feynman’s word on knowing and making or by the convergence of biology and technology. I saw in the iGEM contest an opportunity to discover scientific work from the inside and to experiment how philosophical reflections could get practical and debated inside a scientific group.
