iGEM Evry 2012 achievements
Asides from having lots of fun, meeting great people, gathering around cheese and wine and lazying around the Genopole gardens during lunch break, we also did a little bit of work. Here is a list of our achievements:
We brought a new multicellular chassis to iGEM
We submitted 21 biobricks to the registry, including the first working Xenopus biobricks
We characterized 12 Biobricks: BBa_K812000 , BBa_K812050 , BBa_K812010 , BBa_K812030 , BBa_K81203 , BBa_K812032 , BBa_K812110 , BBa_K812130 , BBa_K812132 , BBa_K812133 , BBa_K812200 and BBa_K812233 .
We designed a method for testing multicellular systems in Xenopus rapidly
We provided 3 new plasmids for using this method, which include debugging tools, BBa_K812000 , BBa_K812200 , BBa_K812300
Our reporters and promoters were characterized .
We did a collaboration with Team Slovenia and we injected their construction into our fertilized embryos: Results
We designed a multicellular hormonal system
We created an Auxin production ( BBa_K812014 ) device for use in eukaryotes from the prokaryote one
We submitted the Tir1 ( BBa_K812012 )  auxin detection device to the registry
We showed the first Synthetic ecosystem , with a unicellular chassis (E.coli) improved inside a multicellular chassis (Xenopus)
We designed a new biobrick standard
We demonstrated it works (still with a low efficiency) and that the protocol have to be further optimized
We managed to assemble parts with a very high efficiency using Golden Gate and the GoldenBricks plasmids
We used a multi-level approach to model various aspects of the physiology and cellular behaviour of Xenopus.
All our models fit together to comprehensively depict all the processes from the experimental protocol to reporter expression
We used many modelisation techniques ( Ordinary differential equations , some derived from partial differential equations and Gillespie algorithm ) in order to benefit from their respective strength.
We submitted an extensive report of our conclusions about synthetic biology in vertebrates, which is the fruit of our long reflection we conducted over the summer.
