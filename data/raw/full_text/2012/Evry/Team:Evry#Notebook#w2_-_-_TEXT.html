Week 2: 18th June - 24th June
Monday, 18th June
Inoculation
Auxin and salkowski's test purchased
Tuesday, 19th June
Miniprep
J23100 RFP: 101.9 ng/uL
K515100 Auxin: 319.7 ng/uL
Misc
Liquid culture of aux and RFP
Wednesday, 20th June
Previous work :
Liquid culture of DH5a with mRFP and auxin plasmid
Main goals:
Auxin toxicity test
Bacterial integration assessment into the xenopus embryos
Experiments
Xenopus embryos present a protective membrane, we decided to realize our bacterial deposits experiments on xenopus with and without their membrane. Then, we could see if bacterias could enter into the embryos naturally.
On 96 plates, each plate contains 1 embryo:
Plate 1:
Line A & B = on embryos without protective membrane : 500 uL mRFP plasmid on DH5a deposite + 1mL LB + 1mL MMR medium
Line C : 1 2 3 : normal embryos : 500 uL mRFP plasmid on DH5a deposite + 1mL (LB + MMR medium)
Line E & F = embryos without protective membrane : 500 uL AUX plasmid integrated on DH5a deposit + 1mL LB + 1mL MMR medium
Line G & M1-6 = normal embryos : 500 uL AUX plasmid integrated on DH5a deposit + 1mL LB + 1mL MMR medium
Line M7-9 = normal embryos : controls
Plate 2 (normal embryos only):
Line A & B
Line C : LB/MMR medium
Line D : RFP 0.1uL
Line E : AUX 0.1uL
Line G & H : LB/MMR medium only (no embryos)
On 16 Plates each plate contains 3 tadpoles:
Line A : 0.5uL RFP bacteria
Line B1 : 0.3uL RFP bacteria
We put this plate on UV light 15min after the deposit:

Comments:
Plate 2: 50% of dead when we spread bacterias on embryos. All dead if we drown the embryos of bacteria.
Plate 1: All dead except 1
Plate 3: All the tadpoles are fluorescent except the control one.

Bacterial Transformation
Bacteria: T10
DNA: pCS2 (+) at 640 ng.uL-1
Protocol:
Keep constantly the cells on ice
Add 1 uL of pCS2 (+) in 100 uL of T10
Incubate 30 min on ice
Heat shock the cells during 30 sec at 42 degree Celsius in a water-bath without shaking
Put 2 min on ice
Add 500 uL of pre warmed SOC-medium
Incubate 1h at 37 degree Celsius at 225 rpm
Spin at 5000 rpm during 30 sec
Remove 150 uL - 400 uL of supernatant
Resuspend the pellet in the 150 uL left
Spread on appropriate plates
Incubate overnight at 37 degree Celsius
