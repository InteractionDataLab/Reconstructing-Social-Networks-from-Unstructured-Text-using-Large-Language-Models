Protocol:
Keep constantly the cells on ice
Rehydratation of DNA in 10uL H2O 2) Add 1 uL of DNA in 50 uL of T10
Incubate 30 min on ice
Heat shock the cells during 30 sec at 42 degree Celsius in a water-bath without shaking
Put 2 min on ice
Add 500 uL of pre warmed SOC-medium
Incubate 1h at 37 degree Celsius at 225 rpm
Spin at 5000 rpm during 30 sec
Remove 150 uL - 400 uL of supernatant
Resuspend the pellet in the 150 uL left
Spread on appropriate plates
Incubate overnight at 37 degree Celsius

Plasmid purification:
Protocol:
Pellet 3mL bacterial culture by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 3 min at room temperature
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250 uL Buffer P1
Add 250 uL Buffer P2 and mix 4-6 times. Let it for no more than 5 min
Add 350 uL Buffer N3 and mix 4-6 times
Centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 10 min
Take the supernatant and apply to the QIAprep spin column
Centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 60 sec
Discard flow-through
Centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 60 sec
Discard flow-through
Place column in a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
Add 50 uL Buffer EB to the column for elution and let stand for 1 min
