Collaborations
La Paillasse: The Paris community Lab for Biotech
La Paillasse is a physical and web platform for citizen scientists, amateur biologists, researchers and entrepreneurs that fosters open-science, debates and hands-on practice of Biotechnology. La Paillasse is also the first and largest community laboratory for Biotech in France. This year, La Paillasse and some of its members are joining the team of Evry to participate in the design and the realization of one of the coolest iGEM project ever: The french froggies. During the summer, La Paillasse have hosted and organized meet-ups between citizens and the iGEM team for explaining the stakes of our iGEM projects and of Synthetic Biology in general. More in the Human practice section. La Paillasse website!
Lab team
Tristan Cerisy
Master 2, mSSB, Evry university
I did my bachelor at Evry’s University, in Bioinformatics. During that year when Jean-loup Faulon presented iGem and synthetic biology, I found it very interesting. I wanted to participate with iGem from my bachelor. Because no team existed yet close to our university, William and I decided to create this team in November and we looked for interested people, funding and projects. I am very excited to be involved in this project with this wonderful team.
Jorgelindo Da Veiga Moreira
Master 1, AIV, Diderot University
I’m a bachelor graduated student from a Parisian engineering school. I look forward to a Master degree in biotechnology. I discovered synthetic biology mainly through conferences and I’ve been immediately fascinated by this new biological approach to work on living systems. iGEM is a good opportunity for me to start in this field and to acquire experience for my future engineering carrier.
Carolina Gallo Lopez
Master 2, mSSB, Evry university
Having acquired a background in biology and a first year of master in “Genomics, Cells, Development and Evolution” at the University of Paris Sud 11, I started to be interested in systems biology since my last year of bachelor and decided on getting involved in this approach during both my second year of master and my master’s thesis. I am participating in the iGEM competition as it allows me to combine experimental work with theoretical modelling. I am keen to learn not only different biological techniques and modeling approaches but also to learn from my teammates and other iGEM teams.
Tiffany Souterre
5th year, Sup'Biotech Paris
After a BTS in Biotechnology, I went to Sup'Biotech, an engineering school in Biotechnology. For 6 years, I have been studying DNA manipulation, bacteria transformation... but it is only recently that I have heard about Synthetic Biology. It is such a promising and interesting field but requires multidisciplinary skills. I am eager to increase my knowledge to be able to work at the interface of biology and computer science. I discovered iGEM thanks to the 2009 Sup'Biotech team and I have no doubt it will be a great opportunity to learn more, gain experience and hopefully bring a modest contribution to Synthetic Biology.
William Rostain
Master 2, mSSB, Evry university
I did my bachelor in Edinburgh university, and came into contact with synthetic biology when I participated iGem with the 2010 Edinburgh team. My background is mostly molecular microbiology and biotechnology, but during iGEM I came into contact with modelling and how it could serve biology, thanks to the great modellers in our team. I decided to participate in mSSB in order to learn some more about modelling and programming so I could work more closely with computer people later :)
Cyrille Pauthenier
Student of the Ecole Normale Supérieure and member of mSSB
I participated in the 2011 iGEM Paris-Bettencourt team who was a finalist and won the prize for best presentation at the European semi-final, and then sweet sixteen at the MIT. I've studied this year in the mSSB master, I'm now about to start a PhD in metabolic engineering at Jean-Loup Faulon's laboratory at iSSB.
Karine Chauris
5th year, Sup'Biotech Paris
I’m currently in my final year at Sup'Biotech Paris, a school of biotechnology, and my professional aim is to work on bioproduction processes. I’ve been attracted, since I was young, by all the possibilities of DNA manipulation and discovered synthetic biology with the first synthetic bacteria. Why did I join iGEM? It's a unique chance to participate in a challenging and concrete project.
Joachim Eeckhout
4th year, Sup'Biotech Paris
I'm in my fourth year at Sup'Biotech, an engeenering school in biotechnologies. Like many others, I have been amazed by the controversy surrounding the publication of Craig Venter and his synthetic bacterium "Synthia". Since then, I am very interested to acquire expertise in this field and the iGEM competition is a chance for me to be part of this new science.
Raphael Ferreira
1st year, AIV
I've currently finished my license (Bachelor) in biotechnology and I'm about to join the AIV (Interdisciplinary approaches to life science) Masters. I discovered synthetic biology with the Craig Venter's paper (released in may 2010). After that, my school gave me a 5 month research & information processing project on synthetic biology. Through this project I've discovered the iGEM competition and the opportunities surrounding the emergence of this science filed. Enrolling in an iGEM team will give me a sight of how synthetic biology experimentations are, and also, to work with people who are interested in this science too.
Pierre Yves Nogue
2nd year Biology degree, Versaille Saint-Quentin University
Biologist student in Paris university, I've discovered the synthetic biology when I've joined "La Paillasse", a biohackspace in Paris. In the same time, I've learned about the existence of the Igem competition, and decided to join the Evry team after some meetings. Indeed, iGEM looks for me as a very good opportunity to work on really interesting subjects in an encouraging work atmosphere, and I've found all this advantages in the Evry team!
Hafez El-Sayyed
Master 2, mSSB, Evry university
I did my bachelor's degree and my first Master year In Beirut Arab University, Lebanon, In Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I came across the term synthetic Biology on the mSSB Website and then started doing some research about the Synthetic Biology topic. Now I want to be part of this wave of unorthodox and ingenious attempts to help create better things around us. I COULDN'T BE Prouder  to be part of IGEM EVRY 2012.
Modeling team
Artémis Llamosi
3rd year, Ecole Centrale Paris
After completing a Master in engineering at École Centrale Paris and a research master in applied mathematics for biology at Paris 6 University, I am to start a PhD thesis on real-time control of biological systems on microfluidics chips. For many years interested in the relation between maths and biology, I discovered synthetic biology in 2011 through its connection to systems biology and immediately got "infected". My expertise being mostly on theoretical aspects, I enrolled in iGEM to get closer to the wetlab and apply my scholar knowledge to real life problems.
Pierre Parutto
5th year, Epita
I am curently in 5th year at the engineering school Epita and specialized in scientific computations. I am interested in biology since high school and more especially in the links between biological systems and my speciality: computer science. After all a cell can be seen as a kind of computer, as seen in the name "genetic code". I learned about the IGEM comptetition when I discovered the synthetic biology field in an article in Nature a few years ago. Since then I wanted to participate to the comptetition but never had the opportunity. I bring to the team my programming and engineering skills and hope to learn a lot from biologist in the lab.
Iryna Nikolayeva
2nd year, Telecom Sud Paris
As specialization of my last year in the engineering school Telecom SudParis, I will be doing the mSSB (master in systemic and synthetic biology). I've got useful computer science and maths skills for modeling and making the wiki. I imagine that mixing technologies and life science can lead to exciting inventions and discoveries. The iGEM seemed to me a nice opportunity to get to know the synthetic biology background and interact with students that are interested in it!
Mohamed Machat
Master 2, mSSB, Evry university
I am a civil engineer from Tunisia. My penchant for genetics has started since my first biology lectures in college. However, the first opportunity that I got to go into this field showed up in 2011, when I was admissible to join the ISSB master program. So I left my engineer job and have moved to France. The adventure of iGem looks to me a good step towards my career ambition: invest my mathematics and mechanics background into oncology!!
Human practice
Clément Marquet
Master 2, Philosophy, Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne University
I'm completing a master of philosophy of science at Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University. I discovered synthetic biology about two years ago in a popular scientific review and was struck by the ambition of the field and the diversity of disciplines involved in it. I was seduced by the special place that laboratories such as Synberc give to social sciences and started thinking about some epistemological questions that could be raised by Feynman’s word on knowing and making or by the convergence of biology and technology. I saw in the iGEM contest an opportunity to discover scientific work from the inside and to experiment how philosophical reflections could get practical and debated inside a scientific group.
Chassis
