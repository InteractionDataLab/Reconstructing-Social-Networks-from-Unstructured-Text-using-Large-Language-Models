French Froggies : New Xenopus plasmids for creating multicellular systems
We developed and submitted to the registry 2 new plasmid backbones for creating multicellular synthetic systems and the corresponding biobricked promoters
The pSC2+ with the CMV promoter: K812000
The pSC2+ with pElastase promoter (pancreas specific): BBa_K812200
And the Biobricked pElastase alones: BBa_K812233
And with a fluorescent citrine to characterize the promoter pElastase in the frog:
We also submitted a heat shock Xenopus promoter: BBa_K812331
A serie of new eukaryotic reporters ready for expression
Expression of the sfGFP in pCS2+ microinjected in a tadpole
We also prepared a series of fluorescent reporters with a kozak sequence for high expression in eukaryotes.
A kozak-citrine in pSB1C3: K812030
A kozak-sfGFP in pSB1C3: K812031
A kozak-mCFP in pSB1C3: K812032
And provided them directely cloned in pSC2+ for direct expression in Xenopus or chicken:
The Citrine in pSC2+: K812130
The mCFP in pSC2+: K812132
The sfGFP in pSC2+: K812133
All these plasmids can be directly injected in to the Xenopus embryo after a miniprep, and are designed for rapid testing of multicellular devices. They contain all sequences necessary for a tissue specific expression, as well as debugging tools. Several plasmids can be co-injected, allowing ratio adjustment and linking the system do modeling.Once the system is tested and debugged, the final system can be implemented by chromosomal insertion.

The auxin system
Auxin production device
We adapted the auxin production module created by the Imperial College 2011 team for it to be used in eukaryotes. We made a system designed for coinjection, and a system which works with a single “operon” using pep2A. This is a short self-cleaving peptide, which will cut a nascent peptide chain to make 2 proteins, insuring stochiometry of the products in the cell. These auxin production devices are designed to communicate through the organism with the auxin reception device.

K812021: IAAM enzyme that catalyses the transformation of Tryptophan to Inodle-3-acetamide
K812014: Auxin production cassette containg both enzymes above which is monocystronic
Auxin reception device
The auxin reception device is composed of two components : Tir1, an auxin dependant ubiquitin ligase, and AID – a peptide that is recognized and ubiquitinated specifically by Tir1, when auxin is present. By fusing AID to any protein, this protein will be degraded along with the AID tag when auxin is added to the medium.
