Violacein is a violet pigment produced by several bacteria through pathway of 5 related genes, vioA, vioB, vioC, vioD and vioE. It was initially discovered in Chromobacterium violaceum. This metabolite of tryptophan has such special applications as antibacterial, anti-trypanocidal, anti-ulcerogenic, and anticancer drugs. There are three branches in this pathway which could verify the efficiency of the Membrane Rudder.
In Violacein Membrane Rudder System, VioA, VioB, VioE and VioC constitutively aggregate. When blue light is present, VioD with Membrane Anchor would aggregate with complex of VioA,B,C and E, making violacein the dominnant final product.But if you turn the light off, VioD with Membrane Anchor would dissociate with VioA,B,C and E. Thus the biosynthetic pathway for deoxyviolacein is switched on.
