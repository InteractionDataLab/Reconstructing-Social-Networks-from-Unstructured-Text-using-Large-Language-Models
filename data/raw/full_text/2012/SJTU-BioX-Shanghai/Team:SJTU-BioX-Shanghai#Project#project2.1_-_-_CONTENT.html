Based on Membrane Scaffold, we are now trying to achieve this goal through controlling the aggregation state of different enzymes in branched biological reactions.

VioA, a flavoenzyme and VioB, a heme protein, work together to oxidize and dimerize tryptophen into IPA imine dimer. Then VioE induces an indole rearrangement, producing prodeoxyviolacein acid, also known as PVA. In a word, enzyme VioA, VioB and VioE convert tryptophen into PVA. Then this biosynthetic pathway is about to branch.
</P><P>In <I>E.coli</I>, an additional side reaction could occur, and PVA is converted into a green pigment called deoxychromoviridans.
</P><P>The last two enzymes, VioC and VioD are flavin-dependent oxygenases. VioC alone transforms PVA into a purple pigment called deoxyviolacein. VioC could also act cooperatively with VioD. VioD hydroxylates 5-position indole ring, and then the other 2-position indole ring is processed by VioC to create the oxindole. In this way, violacein is produced.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Membrane_Rudder_Sensing_RNA_Signal">Membrane Rudder Sensing RNA Signal</SPAN></H3><P>Membrane Accelerator and Membrane Rudder are both post-translational controlling device to regulate metabolic flux of the host cell. To connect this relatively isolated post-translational control system to genetic circuits, we employed RNA signal, which is present in cytoplasm. Rationally designed RNA D0 with MS2 and PP7 aptamer domain is recruited. When RNA molecule with this two aptamer domains is present in cells, their cognate aptamer binding proteins can thus aggregate together. Furthermore, if we place RNA D0 (with PP7 and MS2 aptamer domains) under various promoters regulated by different signals, approaches to induce dimerization would be expanded sharply. Thus, Membrane Rudder could sense much more signals.
</P><P>We constructed our device as demonstrated in <I>Fig.3</I>. In RNA-sensing <I>Membrane Rudder</I>, VioA, VioB, VioE and VioC with interacting Membrane Anchors constitutively aggregate. <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SJTU-BioX-Shanghai/Project/project1.2" class="external text" rel="nofollow">RNA D0</A>, can aggregate with RNA aptamer binding protein MS2 and PP7. So when RNA D0 is present, VioD with MS2-coupled Membrane Anchor would aggregate with assembly of VioA, B, C and E, making violacein the dominant final product. But when RNA D0 is absent, VioD with MS2-coupled Membrane Anchor will disassociate with VioA, B, C and E. Thus the biosynthetic pathway for deoxyviolacein is switched on.

When blue light is on, VioA, B, C, D and E aggregate together, making violacein the dominant final product. When blue light is off, VioD with Membrane Anchor will disassociate with VioA, B, C and E. Thus the biosynthetic pathway for deoxyviolacein is switched on.
</P><P>Moreover, a significant decrease of side products such as deoxychomoviridans was observed when <I>Membrane Rudder</I> system was present.
</P><P><B>Direction Alteration</B></P><P>Altering direction of violacein &amp; deoxyviolacein synthetic pathway can be realized by dynamically controlling the aggregation state of crucial enzymes. Through the blue light induction, all five enzymes aggregate together. Thus branch pathway producing deoxyviolacein by VioA, B, E and C is inhibited because PVA is more preferably hydroxylated by VioD. On the other hand, as long as blue light is absent from the bacteria, VioD will disassociate with assembling VioA, B, E and C, leading to the production of deoxyviolacein.

Fig. C shows the HPLC result from sample with from sample under blue light induction.The HPLC results show that the peak of deoxyviolacein appears at about 9 minutes after the injection. The peak of deoxyviolacein is identified according to previously published research. Results indicate that the amount of the deoxyviolacein from the sample without blue light induction is tremendously larger than that from light induced sample</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>
Under the induction of blue light, production of deoxyviolacein was inhibited (to almost 0%) while most products were violacein, which is predicted above. Without blue light induction, however, the pathway leading to the production of deoxyviolacein was turned on and thus considerable amount of deoxyviolacein was produced. All results confirmed the feasibility of our light-sensing <I>Membrane Rudder</I>. Besides, it indicated that by replacing signal sensors and functioning enzymes, we could regulate direction of various branched reactions through diversified signals.
</P><P><B>Decrease in Side Products</B></P><P>We also found membrane anchored enzymes could help to reduce the amount of side-product(deoxychromaviridans) by 8 fold compared to diffusing cytoplasmic enzymes. This is because rationally designed enzyme assembly facilitate and improve the metabolic flux of biosynthesis. Intermediate PVA is more preferably processed by adjacent membrane anchored VioD or VioC rather than converted into deoxychromaviridans. Actually this is one of the advantages of Membrane Scaffold.
