Achievements
Realization of Membrane Magic
We expanded the definition of scaffold and developed two universal devices called Membrane Accelerator and Membrane Rudder respectively.
Both of the two devices worked as expected. We improved Fatty Acid synthesis efficiency by 24 fold and stringently switched the direction of Violacein synthetic pathway through blue light signal.
Improvement of Previous Part
We improved previous team's part BBa_I714891 by spliting EGFP into two halves. Split EGFP device could function as a reporter for protein interaction.
Inter-team Help
We helped Team SUSTC-Shenzhen-A characterize their App and gave user feedback.  Moreover, we tested the website of Team SUSTC-Shenzhen-B .
Parts Submission
We have submitted 42 well characterized parts which could either be used directly or serve as a universal tool readily for others' use.
Human Practice
We created an association, called Biocraft in SJTU, spreading synthetic biology in high school and college. To raise more awareness of synthetic biology in society, we interviewed and tried to build collaboration relationship with the founder of Huaqiao Foundation, a non-profit foundation which helped the poor who are suffering.
