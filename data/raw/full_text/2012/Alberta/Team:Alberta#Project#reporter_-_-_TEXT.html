Reportors
Reporter function
Reporters are often used in cell and molecular biology to identify whether the experiment is successful within few seconds. Reportor gene is attach to a regulatorable promotor for gene of interest. When the experiment reaches expectation result the rportor protein molecules will show reporting signs, such as positive selection (color, antibiotic resistant, and cell growth)and negative selection (cell death).
What kind reportor we use in our experiment?
Three colour genes
Blue pigment protein (BPP): looks purplely blue under white light.
Green fluoresecent protein (GFP): looks yellow under white light and highlight green under UV light
Red fluoresecent protein (RFP): looks red under white light and highlight red under UV light.
Two antibiotic resistant genes as selectable marker
Kanamycin resist gene: resistant to kanamycin antibiotics
Chloranphenicol resist gene: resistant to chlornphenicol antibiotics
Aplication in project
We uses those color proteins to monitor the gene regulation by the lacI which controls both the plasmid copy number and gradient concentration in the area.
