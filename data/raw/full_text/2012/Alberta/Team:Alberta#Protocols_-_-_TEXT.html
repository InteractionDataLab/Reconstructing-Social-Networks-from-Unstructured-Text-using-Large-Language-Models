Gradient plates
The following procedure is to be used to find values related to diffusion. All time values should be converted to seconds, from when the antibiotic was plated, and all distance values should be recorded in centimeters, from the edge of the well to the first sign of life at the edge of the “kill zone”. Ensure that all materials are sterile before starting.
Draw a central cross on the lid of a Petri dish
Sterilize a tall cylindrical magnet of a height near, but not at the depth of the plate (a well that reaches the bottom of the plate will allow the antibiotic in question to seep under the agar rather than diffuse through it) and radius 0.25 cm. Place the sterilized magnet on the inside of the Petri dish lid and, from outside the lid, adjust and secure the sterilized magnet with another magnet.
Melt and pipette 25 mL of LB agar into the Petri dish, and place the lid on top, allowing the magnet to rest in the molten agar. Let agar rest until solid and cool, then remove the cap and allow the surface to dry until it is free of excess moisture.
Steps 4 and 5 may be completed in any desired order, depending on the approximate amount of time the substance is meant to diffuse for.
Pipette 50 µL of antibiotic (at a concentration high above the minimum inhibitory concentration) into the centre well. Be careful not to spill. Immediately place the plate in a 37ºC incubator.
Evenly plate 200 µL of cells with a resistance to the antibiotic over the flat surface of the plate. Immediately place the plate in a 37ºC incubator.
Begin watching for results within 2 hours of plating. These will come in the form of a slight difference in texture between the zone in which cells are growing, and the zone in which they are not. It will be very subtle, and may need to be observed by shining light through the agar, or placing the plate on a black backdrop. As soon as it is observed, the radius of the zone must be measured from the edge of the well. The zone may expand. Continue recording the size and time until it stops changing.

Chemically-Induced Competence
The protocols described below were used to create competent cells of Top10 and TG-1 Escherichia coli strains. The Calcium Chloride protocol uses less steps, is easier to perform, and produces competent cells faster than the Liquid Nitrogen procedure. However, we found that the competence efficiency was higher using the Liquid Nitrogen protocol.
Calcium chloride
Inoculate cells into culture tube containing 5 mL LB medium
Shake overnight at 37°C
Plate 200 µL of culture on separate LB plates
Incubate overnight at 37°C
Add 1.5 mL of 50 µM CaCl2 into microcentrifuge tube
Cool tube on ice for a minimum of 10 minutes
Scrape colonies off plate until 1x0.5 cm smear is achieved
Swirl scraper in CaCl2 until all cells removed, then vortex tube
Liquid Nitrogen
Inoculate cells into two culture tubes, each with 5 mL LB medium (one culture tube may be used if large enough for aeration)
Shake overnight at 37°C
Add both cultures to a flask containing 250 mL LB medium
Shake at 37°C for 3-4 hours, checking periodically until 0.55 ± 0.05 at OD600 is reached
Place flask on ice for 10 minutes, then transfer to centrifuge bottles
Spin at 2500x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
Decant supernatant, then add 80 mL ice-cold Inoue transformation buffer
Resuspend cells by swirling slowly, not vortexing
Spin at 2500x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
While spinning, chill one hundred microcentrifuge tubes at -80°C
Decant supernatant, resuspend in 20 mL ice-cold Inoue transformation buffer
Mix DMSO (7% of final volume in bottle), then store on ice for 10 minutes
Transfer 200 µL to each pre-chilled tube
Dip tubes in liquid nitrogen for 5 seconds, then store at -80°C

Plasmid Purification
The following protocol is taken from the instructions provided by Qiagen’s QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit. We changed the rpm of centrifuge from 13,000 to 14,000, and used a vacuum apparatus for select steps, instead of centrifuge.
Prepare overnight cultures of E. coli in 5 mL LB medium (optional: chemical selection)
Transfer culture to microcentrifuge tube
Spin for 1 minute at 14,000 rpm at room temperature, then decant supernatant
Transfer culture, spin, and decant again, if needed
Resuspend bacterial pellet in 250 µL buffer P1 (which contains RNase A)
Add 250 µL P2 buffer and invert 4-6 times, not vortex
Add 350 µL N3 buffer and invert 4-6 times immediately
Centrifuge for 10 minutes
Pipette supernatant into spin column attached to a vacuum apparatus
Turn on vacuum
Wash spin column with 500 µL of PB buffer
After PB buffer is removed, wash spin column with 750 µL of PE buffer
Remove spin column from vacuum after buffer is fully removed, and attach it to column bottom
Centrifuge for 1 minute to remove residual buffer
Discard column bottom, and attach spin column to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
Add 50 µL of EB/TE or any low salt  buffer to center of spin column to elute DNA
After resting for 1 minute, centrifuge for 1 minute
Use a spectrophotometer to measure purity and concentration for storage and for further experiments

Overnight Cultures
Add 5 mL of sterile LB medium to autoclaved 20 mL culture tube
Mix following antibiotic concentration, if needed
kanamycin= 1 µL/mL
chloramphenicol= 0.6 µL/mL
ampicillin= 1 µL/mL
tetracycline= 1 µL/mL
Carefully, pick a colony with a sterile pipette tip and eject tip into culture tube
Incubate in shaker at 37°C for a minimum of 12 hours

LB Agar Plates
Add 25 g LB powder mixture to 1 L flask, and fill with 800 mL de-ionized water
Add stir bar to flask and mix on stir plate
Ensure that stir bar is centered in flask, and maintain watch, as flask may fall
After mixture is fully dissolved in water (~10 minutes), add de-ionized water until final volume is 1 L
Add 3.75 g agar into four 500 mL autoclave-safe bottles, and pour 250 mL of the LB mixture into each bottle
Autoclave bottles, and ensure that bottle caps are screwed just loose enough to lift the bottle by grabbing the cap
This will prevent the bottles from exploding from internal pressure, and will also prevent the formation of a vacuum, which can cause contamination
After autoclaving, leave the caps loose until the agar is comfortable to touch
Antibiotics and other chemicals may be mixed in at this stage
kanamycin= 1 µL/mL
chloramphenicol= 0.6 µL/mL
ampicillin= 1 µL/mL
tetracycline= 1 µL/mL
Pour 25 mL of molten agar into each sterile petri dish
Let petri dishes cool down until agar solidifies, then it can be used immediately, or stored in fridge
If stored, let agar warm to room temperature before plating, so bacteria are not shocked from rapid temperature changes, leading to less colonies

PCR (50 µL reaction)
Create a working stock (5 ng/µL) of template DNA, and add 1 µL to PCR tube
Add 2.5 µL each of 10 µM forward and reverse primers to PCR tube
Add 1 µL of 25 µM dNTPs
Add 10 µL of 5X HF Phusion buffer, along with 0.5 µL Phusion enzyme
Adjust final tube volume to 50 µL with highly purified water
Try to minimize bubble formation, as this can hinder Phusion from functioning optimally
Set the PCR machine with appropriate denature, annealing, and extension temperatures, as well as appropriate durations and cycles

Gel Electrophoresis
Create a 1 L 1X TAE buffer
Mix 100 mL of 1X TAE buffer with 1 g of agarose to create gel mixture
Microwave for 45 seconds, or until solution turns transparent and no agarose is visible
Let solution cool down until comfortable to touch, and pour exactly 16 mL onto a 7.7x6.5 cm glass plate
Ensure that gel mixture spreads evenly and covers entire plate without touching the ground
Place a comb 1.5 cm from the edge of glass, then rest for 10 minutes
Squirt few drops of milliQ water along the interface of comb and gel, then gently remove comb
MilliQ water will prevent vacuum from distorting the lanes, and allows easy removal of comb
Place solidified gel plate in gel apparatus, and fill with enough 1X TAE to fully submerge gel
Create loading solutions of DNA and loading dye, then insert into gel lanes alongside the DNA ladder
Run gel using 150 V, then turn off machine when DNA bands reach 2 cm from end (~20 minutes)
Make an ethidium bromide solution with 2.5 µL ethidium bromide and 50 mL 1X TAE
Remove the gel from the plate, and transfer only gel to ethidium bromide solution
After soaking gel for 10 minutes, view banding patterns using UV machine

Transformation of Top10 and TG-1
Refer to Chemically-induced Competence for making competent cells.
Remove competent cells from -80°C freezer, and immediately thaw on ice
Wait until cells fully thaw (~10 minutes) before adding DNA; do not add more than 10% of cell volume
Rest on ice for 30 minutes
Put into 42°C water bath for exactly 90 seconds, then immediately transfer to ice for 2 minutes
Add 1 mL of LB broth to microcentrifuge tube, and incubate for 1 hour at 37°C
Plate 200 µL of culture on selective plates, such as chloramphenicol, kanamycin, or any combination with appropriate concentrations (see LB Agar Plates for our concentration)

Digestion and Ligation
Create plasmid DNA with concentration between 20 and 200 ng/µL for optimum digestion
Transfer 200 ± 10 ng of plasmid DNA to microcentrifuge tube
Add 1 µL enzyme for single digest, and an additional 1 µL different enzyme for double digest
Add 2 µL of 10X appropriate buffer
Fill microcentrifuge tube with milliQ water to reach 20 µL final volume
Incubate for 1 hour at 37°C, or longer if appropriate buffer cannot be used
Refer PCR/Digestion/Ligation Clean-up for purifying digested DNA in preparation of  ligation
Add 3 µL T4 DNA Ligase 10X buffer to 30 µL eluted DNA, then add 1 µL T4 DNA Ligase
Keep mixture at room temperature for 1 hour
If transforming, use 10 µL of ligated DNA for transformation
Refer PCR/Digestion/Ligation Clean-up if further experiments will be performed
[ Top page ]
PCR/Digestion/Ligation Clean-up
Add PB buffer of volume five times the desired clean-up DNA volume (i.e., a 20 µL digest will be mixed with 100 µL PB buffer)
Transfer mixture to spin column attached to a vacuum apparatus, then turn on vacuum
Wash with 750 µL PE buffer
Remove spin column from vacuum after buffer is fully removed, and attach it to column bottom
Centrifuge for 1 minute to remove residual buffer
Discard column bottom, and attach spin column to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube
Add 50 µL of EB/TE or any low salt  buffer to center of spin column to elute DNA
After resting for 1 minute, centrifuge for 1 minute
Use a spectrophotometer to measure purity and concentration for storage and for further experiments
