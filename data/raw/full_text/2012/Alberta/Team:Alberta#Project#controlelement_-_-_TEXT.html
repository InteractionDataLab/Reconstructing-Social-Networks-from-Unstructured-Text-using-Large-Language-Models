Design and testing of repressor control elements
Design and Testing
Spatial patterning of gene expression requires, in addition to spatial chemical gradients, genetic elements allowing gene expression to be controlled by those spatial gradients. We opted to work with three common and well-studied repressors: lacI and tetR, which effectively shut down transcription of operons containing the lacO and tetO operator sequences in their promoter, and for which repression can be relieved by addition of the small molecule inducers isopropyl-thio-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and anhydrotetracycline (ATC).
