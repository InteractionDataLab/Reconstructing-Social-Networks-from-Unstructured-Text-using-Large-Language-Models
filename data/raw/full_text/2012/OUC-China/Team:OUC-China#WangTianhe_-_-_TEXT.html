My name is Tian He Wang, I am currently studying bioscience at the ocean university of China where I joined the iGEM team OUC-China 2012.I am a class monitor and lead the class at all levels for the honorary title. Since middle school was included in the Beijing youth science and technology backup talent cultivation plan and Participate in research at several laboratory such as the Chinese academy of agricultural sciences and Chinese Academy of sciences. In our project my major work is Provide idea and design experiment scheme about gas vesicle protein. In my work, including clone the gvp gene cluster and making fusion protein and modle and artificial gene cluster. I have still a lot to learn in the field of Synthetic Biology, but that makes it a challenge and even more fun.  I am looking forward to getting deep into the field, and meeting all our fellow iGEM participants!   Mail addressed to me! cwth166@163.com
