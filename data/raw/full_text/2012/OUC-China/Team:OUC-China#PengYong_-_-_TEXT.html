I am Peng Yong and major in ecology coming from School of marine life science of OUC. Though I haven’t received enough    knowledge and experimental training, my computer skills makes sense in the competition. I am in born an adherent for    idealism; I love challenges, not a afraid of the indefinites. I feel so lucky to join in this dream-seeking journey. We are    the first group in Shandong Province to participate in the game, courage and vigor will never dry up, we will always take    them with us until the end. I am the main designer and constructor for our wiki page, art design is my favorite!I have     participated in the iGEM competition of 2011,I believe we will explore further this time
