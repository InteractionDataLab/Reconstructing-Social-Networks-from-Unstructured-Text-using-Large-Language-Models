Hi, I am Bao Yingying, a junior student in college of information science and engineering. My major is computer science and technology.  It is a challenge and great honor to me to be the design assistant in OUC-China team. I have the passion for web development, meanwhile, I am now learning. Although it is not my major, I like molecular biology. I hope I can make my team's overview better. Making a great show about our project is the goal of all members.
