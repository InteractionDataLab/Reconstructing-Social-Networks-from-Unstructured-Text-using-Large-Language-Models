Week0
Before the start of this summer, we prepared a lot, including the preparation of laboratory supplies and equipment, recruitment of team, discussion of idea, we also carried out large-scale data computing, using data to prove the feasibility of our idea. All team members also took part in experimental training and ligated fundamental DNA devices for summer work.

Week1
In the first week of our summer work, we divided our team into two groups. One group (qibebt group) went to qibebt to build platform of interacting RNA, and another group (OUC group) stayed in our lab to do experiments about gvp. After short preparing work, qibebt group began our project quickly.
This picture shows Peiran Zhang doing experiment in qibebt.

Week2
This week, we created foundation for our lab, aiming to advertise our iGEM project and obtain support of others. In addition, our modeling work entered a critical period. The left  picture shows our donation box and in the right one, modeling group members working in full swing.

Week3
This week, OUC group went to qibebt and communicated with qibebt group, discussed recent problems deeply. These pictures are welcoming gloves and dinner party of our team.
More Details
Week4
After one week’s hard work, qibebt group successfully added RNA target sequence in front of GFP region and completed inducible sRNA generator. OUC group ligated many circuits, too. iGEMers, keep your chin up!
More Details
Week5
This week, we introduced synthetic biology to freshmen in our university. We cultured marine bacteria that can produce tyrosinase on plate and it presented a picture of “iGEM”. In addition, the sequencing result of our gene circuits turned out right. The right picture is glycerol stocking bacteria.

Week6
This week, we examined the inhibitory action of spot42 to GFP. Besides, we learned how to use microplate reader and how to prepare M9 medium (used  to detect fluorescence). Picture in lower right corner shows the inhibitory action of spot42 to GFP.

Week7
Our bacteria floated! This week, we transformed GVP cluster into E.coli and it floated successfully.
More Details
Week8
This week, we analysed what we had finished when doing experiments simultaneously. It guided us where to go.!
More Details
Week9
The experiment entered the toughest week. This week, we stayed up late to complete our experiments. One day, when we left our lab, to our great surprise, we found the peach tree laden with peaches. It may be a hint that we will succeed finally as long as we work hard every day!
More Details
Week10
This week, we spared no effort to acquire data. We analyzed and measured our final parts over and over again and got abundant valuable experimental data.
More Details
Week11
we are coming! Finally, we insisted on to the last week. We worked hard to make our project visual and acceptable. The last day of our experiment, when we finished the last SDS-PAGE, we found the air full of hope and vigor. You will find the world full of the true, the good and the beautiful after nearly three months’ hard work. Now, we are full of energy and eagerly longing for the future. iGEM, we are coming. Nothing but dreams, everything for dreams!
