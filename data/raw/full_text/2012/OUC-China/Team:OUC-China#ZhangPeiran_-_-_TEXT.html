Hello!I am Zhang Peiran. I'm happy to join this wonderful team!My work includes computational stimulations and the designation of decision-making device,comparator and ratio sensor. Life is the most incredible thing in the world, but I couldn't figure out how God made it possible only by evolution,even if I had billions of years to do that.The universe is magni-ficent,isn't it? Passers-by:My major is Biochemistry and Molecular biology,and you can get in touch with me by sending emails to oucigem@163.com or zpr823@163.com .   Welcome any time! .
