Overview
Our model for ratio sensor and comparator consists of four parts: ODE analysis, parameter sensitivity analysis, parameter sweep, stochastic analysis. ODE analysis is to examine the feasibility of our project, which also provides the foundation for next 3 sections of analysis. Through parameter sensitivity analysis, the vital parameters for the system are distinguished. And we could figure out appropriate ranges of the identified sensitive parameters by parameter sweep. At last, noise analysis based on the fixed ranges of sensitive parameters could simulate the real  conditions in vivo.
