Wet Lab Member & Human-Practice Member
My name’s Minghao Gong. I’m a sophomore majored in Biochemistry and Molecular biology in Ocean university of China. It’s  my honor to be titled as an excellent youth volunteer and be granted for  second-class scholarship. Stem from my passion for life science, I have been working in group of Science and technology and have the opportunity to join iGEM team. In our project I focus on the idea and experimental design of the fine-tuned phosphate sensor as well as the ratio sensor and comparator through artificial sRNA-mRNA interaction. Here we learned the newest technology from latest papers. We brainstormed to conceive a host of stuffs what we never dared to think before. iGEM contest is likely to be a research-based education leading us to a very different fashion for study. I have confidence to show our brilliant ideas on the world stage.
