For Ratio Sensor,we selected a small RNA scaffold which would fuse artificial region to 5’ end of small RNA to construct a strong sRNA::sRNA interaction,the sRNA buffer with each other in cytosol in this case;
For comparator,km2=0,which means sRNA2 is a pool of buffer for sRNA1,at the same time establish a tunable threshold for comparing quantitatively.

</P><H2 id="theoretical">Theoretical analysis through modeling</H2><P><STRONG>What’s in the 3-RNA system?</STRONG>We formulated the mechanism above quantitatively via a simple kinetic model(ODE model) for three RNA interaction. The model is cast in terms of two mass-action equations for the cellular concentrations of the sRNA ([s1],[s2]) and its target GFP mRNA ([m]):
</P><P><STRONG>Is it feasible?</STRONG>In this three-ternary system,there are at least 6 parameters uncertain,we verified the feasibility of constructing such a device through ODE simulation using parameter set from previous researches, fortunately,it is viable theoretically within the affordable parameter range in cell,and it’s apparent enough considering stochasticity.
</P><P><STRONG>Subsquent analysis</STRONG>We conducted a theoretical analysis consists of four steps(<A https:="">Modeling Section</A>)
</P><P>The modeling analysis shed some light on small RNA scaffold selection:in this three-ternary system,one thing is clear, km is the most important parameter in this system in given parameter set,if km is not low enough(&gt;1),there won’t be any chance to get the ideal behaviours by fine-tuning other accessible parameters like the range of transcription rate(α) and sRNA::sRNA  binding rate(ks).

</P><P>We investigated many srNAs,finally selected <I>spot42</I> sRNA and galk::mRNA as our engineering chassis for several reasons:
-1 Theoretical analysis has shown that the mRNA repression rate must be weak enough,we screened small RNAs from characterization data,found that <I>spot42</I> had the weakest repression capability;
-2 <I>spot42</I> is a multitarget sRNA,which is favourable in screening comparator buffer RNA with varied affinity;
-3 <I>spot42</I> has a weak RNA chaperone Hfq binding site,where as galK weaker,which is favourable in sRNA::sRNA interaction with Hfq;
-4 It’s a very strong pairing(up to 20bases),but it only causes 2.6 fold repression according to Johannes H. Urban and Jo¨ rg Vogel,for it doesn’t result in the degradation of the RNA complex by RNaseE(ssRNA degradation) and RNaseIII(dsRNA degradation),both of them are major enzymes that causes RNA degradation in vivo.<I>spot42</I>-galK complex degrades in a slow and presently unclear way;
-5 Well studied,data is sufficient enough.

To this end, we need to make in-depth investigations in <I>spot42</I>-mediated gene silencing.<A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Project/Supplementary">See more</A>.
</P><P><STRONG>2.<I>spot42</I> targets investigation</STRONG>Fortunately Chase L. Beisel has made detailed works about the network that <I>spot42</I> is involved in catabolite repression. Following microarray analysis and beta-galactosidase assays for LacZ-fusion reported by Chase L. Beisel, we finally selected three <I>spot42</I> targets, <I>nanC</I>, <I>ytfJ</I> and <I>srlA</I> as our candidates for comparator buffer RNA. Here are our candidates’ results of microarray analysis.
</P><P style="text-align:center; font-size:90%;">Fig.5 The ratio of mRNA levels for pBRplac and p<I>spot42</I> samples is shown at the right end. We could see that the repression rates of all our candidates are more than 2.6-fold, higher than galK. Although <I>nanC</I> does not work well in microarray analysis, the author indicated that <I>nanC</I>::lacZ fusion gives   surprisingly more than 47-fold repression rate which seems to match our requirement well.<A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Project/Supplementary">Learn more</A>.</P><P><STRONG>3.Analysis secondary structure &amp; binding sites of target mRNA</STRONG>Next we considered if there are motifs that facilitate the interaction by means of some RNA prediction software such as RNA structure, intaRNA and NUPACK.
After confirming the interactive mechanisms, we decided to construct a trial platform to verify the feasibility of our design and acquire the first-hand data for further fine-tuning. The brief introduction of our comparator trial device is below.<A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Project/Supplementary">Learn more</A>.
</P><P style="text-align:center; font-size:90%;">Fig.6 our design for double plasmids inspection.On plasmid J61002, P0440 can produce repressor TetR to repress R0040 while P0412 can produce repressor LacI to repress R0011.The Repression caused by TetR and LacI can be offset by aTc and IPTG repectively, resulting in transcription of buffer RNA and <I>spot42</I>. The other plasmid on the left side contains a reporter gene GFP, fusing with galK. Provided that concentration of <I>spot42</I> in cytosol surpasses that of buffer RNA, it will act as galK::GFP inhibitor to repress the expression of GFP</P><H2 id="sensor">Artificial Region Design: Ratio sensor</H2><P><STRONG>Modeling analysis</STRONG>Similar to our comparator design, we first adjusted our design ideas according to the model we construct. It indicates that ks should be far higher than km which enables sRNA-sRNA interactions prior to sRNA-mRNA interactions.<A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Project/Supplementary">See more</A>.
</P><P><STRONG>sRNA investigation</STRONG>To this end, we have compared a lot of sRNA-mRNA interactions, both trans-acting and cis-acting. Unfortunately, few literatures tried to make comparison between different RNA expression rates for artificial design, let alone the construction of ternary RNAs system. So we have worked extremely hard to shape and improve our design ideas. 
</P><P><STRONG>In silico analysis of 2 different design guidelines</STRONG>First, we searched for sRNA-mRNA interactive mechanisms that show potential for relatively strong interaction. We have brainstormed several ideas in which we picked up only one that showed great potential for success. We singled out translational activated reaction of <I>dsrA</I>-<I>rpos</I> as our ‘raw materials’ for artificial region. It works like this: <I>dsrA</I> activates <I>rpos</I> translation by base-pairing with the 5’ <I>rpos</I> leader, which relieves an intra-molecular stem-loop structure that sequesters the <I>rpos</I> ribosome binding site (RBS). The location of complementary pairing site of <I>dsrA</I>&amp;<I>rpos</I> is shown below. 
</P><P>Secondary structure of <I>dsrA</I>&amp;<I>rpos</I> as well as completed artificial sRNA(<I>dsrA</I>::spo42 &amp;<I>rpos</I>::<I>spot42</I>) is shown below.
</P><DIV><STRONG>Orthogonal ratio sensor</STRONG></DIV><P>While our first design to construct a strengthened inert secondary structure of sRNA-sRNA is on progress, another design gradually matured, given that we have successfully constructed comparator which is based on multi-targets <I>spot42</I> network. The concept of this design focuses more on biological reaction mechanisms that blocking of RBS to prevent ribosomes loading on galK::GFP transcripts is necessary for GFP expression silencing. In view of this, it seems not reliable to simply look for non-cognated sRNA pairs to assembly to <I>spot42</I> respectively.

Designs of comparator shed light on us that targets of <I>spot42</I> inserted into the AR(artificial region) might solve this problem. To this end, we have chosen <I>nanC</I> as an attempt for it. However, it is frustrating that when <I>nanC</I> with various lengths were assembled with <I>spot42</I> in silico, its secondary structure never failed to changed, leading to loss of functional domains. An orthogonal design finally solved this disturbing problem.  Pair of mutant variant in <I>spot42</I> and complementary mutant variant in <I>nanC</I> have been reported previously and they worked perfectly as well. So we decided to introduce 5 bases mutant in <I>nanC</I>(<I>nanC</I>*) as well as complementary mutant in <I>spot42</I>(*<I>spot42</I>). Obviously <I>nanC</I>* is deprived of pairing with <I>spot42</I>, but given ability to pair with *<I>spot42</I>. It significantly protects its innate structures from self-repression when <I>nanC</I>*&amp;<I>spot42</I>(or <I>nanC</I>&amp;*<I>spot42</I> ) was assembled together. 

Moreover, fortunate as it is that complementary domain between <I>nanC</I> and <I>spot42</I> coincidently avoids that between galK and <I>spot42</I>, which prevent *<I>spot42</I> from deprivation of inhibition of galK::GFP expression. The complementary pairing of two pairs are shown below.

</P><P>The secondary structures of <I>spot42</I> , <I>nanC</I>, *<I>spot42</I>::<I>nanC</I> and <I>nanC</I>*::<I>spot42</I> is shown below.
</P><P>Here we can see that the structure is highly compatible when <I>nanC</I>*::<I>spot42</I> (or <I>nanC</I>::*<I>spot42</I>)assembled, involving previously described <I>dsrA</I>::<I>spot42</I>(or <I>rpos</I>::<I>spot42</I>). It further inspired us to carry out experiments to verify our designs.
</P><P><STRONG>Future work</STRONG>Our experiment of those two designs are still in progress. Actually all the artificial sRNA assemblies have already succeeded, though have not been transformed into E.coli with combined plamids carrying our reporter genes. Provided that the-last-run transformation is finished, we could see whether our designs will work well or not. It is exciting that we would check them before the Asian Jamboree and showcase our results of our brand-new ‘ratio sensor’
</P><H2 id="region">Artificial region assembly &amp; Testing quantitatively</H2><P><STRONG>Assembly method</STRONG>We amplify artificial region by PCR from DH5α,using primers with ClaI/SalI site;
ClaI site and SalI site are well-selected restriction sites,they are used to assembly the artificial region to the 5’ end of <I>spot42</I>,are compatible for all of the Ampr and Chlr vectors(no unexpected restction sites).
</P><P><STRONG>Testing method</STRONG>All the sRNA generators with artificial region were tested with inducer gradient, to verify <I>spot42</I> of different levels repression efficiency in vivo.(<A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Project/DesignMaking/Result">Results</A>)
We tested Comparators ligated with <I>srlA</I>/<I>ytfJ</I>/<I>nanC</I> buffer RNA with aTc/IPTG 2-dimension gradient using well designed <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/protocol">protocol</A>,the data is given in <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:OUC-China/Project/DesignMaking/Result">results</A> page,while the data of ratio sensor is still in progress.
</P><P><STRONG>Adjustment</STRONG>We also made some adjustment on the mRNA synthesis rate(αm) by replacing our device to different copy number vectors.We assemblied two sRNA generator together to J61002(Ampr) while ligating GFPmRNA_Generator to pSB4C5(Chlr), to perform double-plasmids transformation.But the function of buffer RNA didn’t work well due to unclear reasons.
</P><P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>1/ColE1 is a medium copy number replication origin(~70 copies per cell),whereas p15A is a low one(~5 copies per cell).
2/The efficiency of endogenous terminator of <I>spot42</I> remains unclear. Another consideration of swiching vectors is to avoid the readthrough of <I>spot42</I>.
Some evidence suggests it’s not very strong: when induces <I>spot42</I> in the upstream of GFP_Generator with very high aTc concentration, the GFP level soared to a very high level(even higher than GFP_generator alone), made it elusive on this paradox.
