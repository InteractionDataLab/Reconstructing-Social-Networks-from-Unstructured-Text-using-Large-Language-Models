We did a multitude of work in respect of experiment, modeling, human practice, etc. Now, here are our achievements:
1. We communicated with Peking University and discussed a lot about experiment and modeling with them in this summer. As the last year, we helped each other. We sent plasmid with agarase coding region to Peking University while they helped us build stochastic model and gave us some important papers about modeling.
More Details
2. We see long future not just one year’s iGEM competition. Our Human Practice slogan is Better youth,better future. So we pay attention to educating potential iGEMers. We develop many new approaches to make iGEM and synbio known to young adults in high school and our university, like by holding camps, for example, hands-on experience summer camp with Qingdao No.2 High School and 2th summer camp of life science and technology.
More Details
3. We registered many well-characterized and improved new biobrick parts. Among them, 45 parts work well.
More Details
4. For new natural part, we have gvp cluster (BBa_K737010) and it can make E.Coli float. Besides, we transformed two plasmids with gvpA and gvpC. And the bacteria floats, too!
More Details
5. We developed a new approach and a new criterion to measure the capacity of bacteria.

Design and Result of Gvp
6. For engineering part, we have BBa_K737045 which can work as a comparator of IPTG and aTc.
More Details
7. For improved parts, we improved BBa_I20260 (K737068 instead), BBa_R0062 (K737067 instead) andBBa_ K127004 (K737034 instead).
More Details
In conclusion, we are fully confident in getting a gold medal because our work deserves it!
