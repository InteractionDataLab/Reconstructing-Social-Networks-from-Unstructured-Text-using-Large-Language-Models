KangLi
Team Leader."Nothing but dreams, everything for dreams."
I'm Kang Li, a student from Ocean University of China, major in Biotechnology. The reason why I participate in iGEM is that I want to test my ability and to fight for my dream with my dearest friends during the most valuable time of my life. As a student who has received custom education for nearly 14 years, I find iGEM is a brand-new thing and a chance to expand my horizon and show real self to me. I want to prove that impossible is nothing by myself. Nothing but dreams, everything for dreams.
