Hello! I, Lian Li, is from Ocean University of China and I am the member of 2012 IGEM OUC team. My major is electronic and information engineering and what am I doing for the project? In this group, I am responsible for the modeling. At the same time, this is the first year for our team to have modeling and it is pretty challenging for us to start the job from scratch. For me, however, it is also an interesting thing, because I will learn so many new things and come over lots of special difficulties with my teammates. Staying with all these excellent guys, I has become more brave, more optimistic and have access to a different spirit for research.
