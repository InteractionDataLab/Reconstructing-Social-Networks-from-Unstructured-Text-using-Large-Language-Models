Hey, guys! I'm Haowen Xu from one of the most fantastic historic country --China. Like many 20-year-old girls, I love to try new things. So I like to travel to experience various different culture and talk with different people. Besides, I was in the student union and have organised a lot of interesting activities for students' better communication. As a junior of Ocean University of China major in mathematics and applying mathematics, I feel very lucky to join the modeling part of IGEM-2012, a very meaningful undergraduates activity. Since it's our second year to take part in this program and first year to participate in modeling part, my work is full of challenges. However, our teammates are all enthusiastic and concerted which makes me more confident and really enjoyed. Also, I believe the saying "When the going gets tough, the tougher gets going." and will keep exploring passionately.
