Who we are
Instructors
Edgar Andrés Ochoa Cruz (Young PhD):
I am a scientist interested in technology and inventions. Working for generating awareness of the power available on current technologies and the positive impact that can be generated through them to improve the life quality of the world population.
This competition was the opportunity to develop my first project in the synthetic biology field. More ideas are coming for new projects...(swordfish1313@gmail.com)
Marie Anne Van Sluys (Full professor):
Dr. Van Sluys is full professor in the Botany Department of the University of São Paulo. She is the head of the Genomic and Transposable Elements Laboratory (GaTE), the GaTE focus is to study the impact of transposable elements in the structure, function, and diversification of bacterial genomes and plants.
Carlos Takeshi Hotta (Assistant Professor)
I am an assistant professor in the Biochemistry Department of the University of São Paulo. I am the head of the Plant Molecular Physiology group, that focus on the role of the circadian clock in increasing plant productivity. I also write a science blog [1] .

Advisors:
José Gregório:
Degree in Biological Sciences from the Institute of Biosciences Masters in Biotechnology from the University of São Paulo (1994) and Ph.D. in Biological Sciences (Microbiology) from the University of São Paulo (2000). He is currently Professor from the University of São Paulo. He has experience in biochemistry, with emphasis on Biochemistry of Microorganisms, acting on the following topics: polyhydroxyalkanoates, biosurfactant, bacterial metabolism, metabolic engineering.
Luiziana Ferreira da Silva:
Graduated in Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences USP (1982), MSc (1990) and Ph.D. (1998) in Biological Sciences (Microbiology) by the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo. She is currently professor Dr., University of São Paulo. Has experience in the area of microbiology with emphasis on Bacteriology. Her research involving: bacterial metabolism, metabolic flux analysis, biosynthesis of biodegradable plastics and elastomers (polyhydroxyalkanoates - PHA) as well as other compounds of biotechnological interest.

Vitor Nascimento
Nestor Caticha
Graduate:
Débora Parrine: Still looking for the camera...
Luíza Barros:  Luíza is a plant scientist. She was the last one to join the team and is always available to talk about how wonderful Molecular Biology can be to solve our lab problems.
Marcelo Boareto: Marcelo is a biological physicist and phD student in Physics. He has two academic goals: to be recognized as a biologist when talking to a biologist and as a physicist when talking to a physicist. Neither of the two has been achieved, yet.
Undergrads
Cauã Westmann:
I'm a Biology undergratuate student at USP and an eternal lover of life and all its aspects. I'm always trying to understand and connect evetything in an holistic evolutionary aproach.
Cleandho Marcos:
I like to understand how life works and how we are related to it. I also like to help people and get to know them. My hobbies are: plants science, hiking and camping.
Chico Camargo:
Chico is a molecular scientist who found his place in the modeling team. He says work and studies are for leisure time -  having fun is his obligation.
Joana Guiro:
Lucas Cespedes
Is an undergraduate of fifth year in biology at USP, besides iGEM, works with industrial microbiology, biodegradable plastics and molecular biology.
