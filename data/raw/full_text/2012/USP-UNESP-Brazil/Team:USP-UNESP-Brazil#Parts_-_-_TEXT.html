There are two more parts that we would like to submit to the registry, these two parts are the two version (Cre-lox71 and lox71-Cre) under the control of the T7 promoter (BBa_K314104), each one of these plasmids is a Plug&Play Machine prototype, we already have these parts in the backbone pSB4A5, which is a low copy number plasmid. We tested one of this version and it worked.
We are working to submit this two parts, in the next couple of weeks, in the proper backbone (pSB1C3), as well as, to test them in the high copy number backbone pSB1C3.
