3 What we did
iGEM Brazilian Team
We are an interdisciplinary group of undergraduate and graduate students from several areas. The undergrads are divided among the Chemistry Institute  (USP), the Biosciences Institute  (USP), the Pharmaceutical Sciences Faculty (USP and Unesp) and the Polytechnic School (USP). The graduate students are from the Biomedical Sciences Institute  (USP), the Chemistry Institute (USP) and the Physics Institute (USP).
USP and UNESP Brazil's Team
Who we are
Instructors
Edgar Andrés Ochoa Cruz (Young PhD):
I am a scientist interested in technology and inventions. Working for generating awareness of the power available on new technologies, like reverse bioinformatics (Computation in biological organisms) and synthetic biology (Energy and biofuel production applications), and the positive impact that they can generate in the life quality of world population.
This competition was the opportunity to develop my first project in the synthetic biology field. More ideas for new projects are coming ...(swordfish1313@gmail.com)
Marie Anne Van Sluys (Full professor):
Dr. Van Sluys is full professor in the Botany Department of the University of São Paulo. She is the head of the Genomic and Transposable Elements Laboratory (GaTE). The GaTE focus is to study the impact of transposable elements in the structure, function, and diversification of bacterial and plants genomes.
Carlos Takeshi Hotta (Assistant Professor)
I am an assistant professor in the Biochemistry Department of the University of São Paulo. I am the head of the Plant Molecular Physiology group, that focus on the role of the circadian clock in increasing plant productivity. I also write a science blog [1] .
Cleslei Fernando Zanelli
Degree in pharmacy and biochemistry from UNESP (2002) and PhD in Biotechnology from UNESP (2006). I am currently an assistant professor in the Biological Sciences Department of Pharmacy School of Araraquara - UNESP. Our lab is interested in understanding the control of protein synthesis using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model for functional genomics analyses. We also use the budding yeast collections of mutants and fusion proteins in high content screenings (HCS) to search for cellular drug targets.
Advisors:
José Gregório:
Degree in Biological Sciences from the Institute of Biosciences Masters in Biotechnology from the University of São Paulo (1994) and Ph.D. in Biological Sciences (Microbiology) from the University of São Paulo (2000). He is currently Professor from the University of São Paulo. He has experience in biochemistry, with emphasis on Biochemistry of Microorganisms, acting on the following topics: polyhydroxyalkanoates, biosurfactant, bacterial metabolism, metabolic engineering.
Luiziana Ferreira da Silva:
Graduated in Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences USP (1982), MSc (1990) and Ph.D. (1998) in Biological Sciences (Microbiology) by the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of São Paulo. She is currently professor Dr., University of São Paulo. Has experience in the area of microbiology with emphasis on Bacteriology. Her research involving: bacterial metabolism, metabolic flux analysis, biosynthesis of biodegradable plastics and elastomers (polyhydroxyalkanoates - PHA) as well as other compounds of biotechnological interest.
Glaucia Souza
Prof. Glaucia Souza is bachelor by the Biosciences Institute at USP (1988), graduate in biochemistry by the Chemistry Institute at USP (1993), post-doctor in molecular genetics by La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation (1994) and post-doctor in molecular genetics by Baylor College of Medicine (1996).  Currently she is associated professor and leader of the Signal Transduction Lab at Chemistry Institute (USP).
Nestor Caticha
Nestor Caticha is a professor at the Instituto de Física USP working in Information theory of artificial and natural systems and Bayesian data analysis. Current research includes  modelling collective properties of societies of information processing agents, theoretical  analysis of decision processes  and the development of methods for neuroimaging using fMRI and EEG. He obtained a B.Sc. from Unicamp and a Ph.D. from Caltech, both in Physics.
Graduate:
Débora Parrine
Débora is a graduate student from Prof. Luiziana's Lab. Her research involves production of biodegradable materials and metabolic engeneering.
Luíza Barros:
Luíza is a plant scientist. She was the last one to join the team and is always available to talk about how wonderful Molecular Biology can be to solve our lab problems.
Marcelo Boareto:
Marcelo is a biological physicist and phD student in Physics. He has two academic goals: to be recognized as a biologist when talking to a biologist and as a physicist when talking to a physicist. Neither of the two has been achieved, yet.
Undergrads:
Cauã Westmann:
I'm a Biology undergratuate student at USP and an eternal lover of life and all its aspects. I'm always trying to understand and connect everything in an holistic evolutionary aproach.
Cleandho Marcos:
I like to understand how life works and how we are related to it. I also like to help people and get to know them. My hobbies are: plants science, hiking and camping.
Chico Camargo:
Chico is a molecular scientist who found his place in the modeling team. He says work and studies are for leisure time -  having fun is his obligation.
Daniel Ariano
Daniel is a Mechanic Engineer who loves every kind of science and technology, what includes synthetic biology. He is the "handyman" of the group.
Fernando Lindenberg
I am an undergraduate student at São Paulo State University at Araraquara, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences. I spent the last two years working and learning molecular biology at the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology.
Joana Guiro:
Joana is a third year Biology undergraduate student at USP. She is very hard working and became pretty good in molecular biology basic techniques in the last couple of months.
Lilian Oliveira
Lilian is a happy chemistry student at USP. She has the "gold hands" of the group: everything works with her magic touch.
Lucas Cespedes
Is an undergraduate of fifth year in biology at USP, besides iGEM, works with industrial microbiology, biodegradable plastics and molecular biology.
Macarena López:
Is a chilean biology student at USP.  She is at her second year, but has no idea at what field will she specialize. Every living organism appears to be worth and interesting to study for her!
Otto Heringer
He is a chemistry undergraduate student with an interdisciplinary feeling. In short: a synthetic biologist wannabe.
Pedro Medeiros
I have a degree in Biology and now I'm an undergraduated in Pharmacy and Biochemistry by University of São Paulo. My interests are multidesciplinary, but I have a special attention in informatics, technology, open source development and biological sciences. I want to be a Bio Cyber Punk evil scientist in the future.... soon... soon...
