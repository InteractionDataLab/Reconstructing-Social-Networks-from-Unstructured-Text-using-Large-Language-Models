SynbioBrasil Blog
Our blog http://scienceblogs.com.br/synbiobrasil/
During the activities of our Biology Synthetic Club, which became the base of this iGEM team, we created a blog aiming to generate information in Portuguese about synthetic biology ( http://scienceblogs.com.br/synbiobrasil/ ). Our blog is the first website specialized in Synthetic Biology in our country and is now incorporated to the largest community of science blogs in Portuguese: ScienceBlogs Brasil [1] . It has been viewed more than 10,000 times since January 2012 and remains as one of the only resources about synthetic biology in Portuguese.
