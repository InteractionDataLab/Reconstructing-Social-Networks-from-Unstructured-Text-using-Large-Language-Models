The team came up with ideas for projects and after discussions which involved all students as well as all advisors and instructors, it was decided to develop two projects. So, the team had to find a way to obtein money to subscribe in competition. For this purpose, the instructor Carlos Hotta and the student Otto Heringer had an insight of doing a video and posting it on a crowdfunding site on internet, RocketHub. It turned out to be a great idea, since the team successfully achieved the inscription fee.
The Plug&Play project was executed by the undergraduate students Cauã Westmann, Joana Guiro and Macarena Lopez. The students were supervised and helped by the instructor Edgar Andrés Ochoa C. (at that time he was a PhD student). He created the project, helped them in the development of the experiments and gave them theoretical support. The experiments were developed in the GaTE Lab at Bioscience Institute-USP headed by Full Professor Dr. Van Sluys, where the team received support and laboratory materials.
The Associative Memory Network was executed by the undergraduate students: Cleandho Marcos, Daniel Ariano, Fernando Lindenberg, Liliam Oliveira, Lucas Cespedes, Otto Heringer and Pedro Medeiros; and the masters students Débora Parrine and Luíza Barros. Three laboratories gave support to this project: instructor Professor Carlos Hotta’s Lab at Chemistry Institute -USP, instructor Professor Cleslei Fernando Zanelli’s Lab and advisor Professor José Gregório’s Lab at Institute of Biomedical Sciences-USP. Those instructors and advisors not only gave support by allowing us to use their labs but also on theoretical support to solve problems on experiments.
The two mathematical models were developed by the postgraduated student Marcelo Boareto and the undergraduate student Francisco Camargo and was supervised by the advisor Professor Nestor Caticha. The postgraduated students André Schraider Maizel and Jonatas Eduardo Cesar as well as the students Daniel Ariano and Otto Heringer have helped with sugestions.
Wiki texts were checked by the instructor Edgar Andrés Ochoa and all students were responsible for updating it. Wiki’s layout was designed by the student Otto Heringer.
