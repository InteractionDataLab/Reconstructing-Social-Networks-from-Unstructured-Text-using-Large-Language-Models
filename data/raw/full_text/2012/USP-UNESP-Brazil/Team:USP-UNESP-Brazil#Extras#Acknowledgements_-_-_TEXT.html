Acknowledgements
Since the birth of the idea about creating an iGEM team (two years ago), this project was helped by many people. We wish to use this page to thank everyone who made this obstinate student initiative possible.
Prof. Nestor Caticha
His inspiring hungry to new subjects to learn without academic barriers was the driven force behind his important contribuition to the group. A little brainstorming is a valuable resource if it is done with Nestor. Thanks to his provocative insight, we were able to propose the design of a bacterial system who can have an associative memory.
Prof. Luiziana Silva and Prof Gregorio Gomez
This dinamic duo was very important to advising about organizational, scientific and political issues about the projects and the initiative itself. With their help, we were able to organize the Synthetic Biology Club, what lead us to develop our insights and ideas for projects.
Prof. Gláucia Mendes Souza
Her support was vital to the practical development of the project. Offering her lab and resources to our project was another key element that makes all this possible. We have no words to thanks.
Dr. Mateus Lopes Schreiner
Every history have a beginning and character who begins to plot. With an inspiring and enthusiastic feeling, Dr. Mateus ignited the fire that became an persistent student effort to create am iGEM team and learn more about synthetic biology. His encouraging support was fundamental to the existence of the group today.
Prof. Telma Zorn
We would not ever be able to travel to the jamborees without the help of prof. Telma. Her advices were greatly important not only for the iGEM initiative at USP, but even for ourselves in knowing very better how the university can support us.
Graduation Comittees
We wish to thank a lot all the support that was given in to us by all professors from all institutes that contributed to our travels through the undergraduation internationalization program. Again, no words to thanks!
Crowdfunding
Sometimes incredible things happen. And I can assure you: a great part of these things happen because the help of the many, with the help of the crowd! Without them we would never have the initial capital to invest in the project and also the media impact about the initiative. Again, for every one of the 39 persons who helped our subscription: thank you very very much!
Unicamp-EMSE 2011 iGEM team
The outstanding support from the ones who already experienced an iGEM isn't mensurable. They helped us with valorous advices and provided the BioBricks of 2011 to us, an important resource before the 2012 distribuition. We wish to thanks particulary Mariana Favaro, Nemailla Bonturi, Gleidson Teixeira and prof. Renato Vicentini.
We also wish to thank all other persons who helped directly or indirecly in all our achievements this year, but where not mentioned here. Thank you!
