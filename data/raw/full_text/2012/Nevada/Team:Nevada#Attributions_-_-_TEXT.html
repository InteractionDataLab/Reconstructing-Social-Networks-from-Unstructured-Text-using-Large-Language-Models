All experiments were performed by the students. None of the advisors performed any experiments but they did explain and guide us through the experiments we were unfamiliar with. All parts were created and submitted by the undergraduates of Team Nevada iGEM. Dr. Tang and Dr. Howard helped a lot with troubleshooting and guiding the students in figuring out how to fix any problems that arose. They did not give us the answer to solving a problem but helped us figure out an answer to solving our own problems. Dr. Shintani kindly sat in on some of our meetings and provided additional direction.
Information regarding genetically modified rice was all provided by plant manager George Graham of Calrose rice. Information regarding regulations of genetically modified rice and information about the milling/processing of rice were also provided by George. He also gave us feedback regarding our iRICE. Other people that helped are Olivia John who helped by preparing stock solutions and reagents. Dr. Patricia Ellison helped by providing us with the best method to express our starch binding proteins. Dr. Alexander Van der Linden and Dr. Jeff Harper provided a fluorescent microscopes that helped with imaging of the construct model. We also would like to acknowledge the Associated Students of University of Nevada and Charles River in helping fund a major portion our trip to the iGEM Regional Jamboree. A big thanks goes out to NEVADA INBRE for annually helping fund our research and our trip to Stanford, CA for the America West Jamboree and the World Championship Jamboree in Cambridge, MA. Lastly, a big shout out to our advisors: Dr. Howard, Dr. Shintani, and Dr. Tang. Without them, none of this would have ever been possible and we are forever grateful that they have given us this opportunity.
