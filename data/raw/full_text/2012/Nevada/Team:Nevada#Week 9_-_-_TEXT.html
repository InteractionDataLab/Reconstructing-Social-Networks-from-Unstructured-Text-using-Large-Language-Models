July 16
Michelle:
Miniprep from yesterday’s cultures of SBP (SpeI and PstI)-LRP (PstI and XbaI) and digest with XbaI and PstI.
Chris & Jermiah
Colony PCR ligation from 07/15 (gel 089)
Most likely switching to IPTG promoter
Samples from colony 1-9 set up with L. Arabinose expression gradient.
1.0 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.01 mM, 0.001 mM
Samples were taken in intervals of hours: 0,2,4,6,8, O/N
Justin and Dafne
Overnight samples were taken for all concentrations
Run samples using SDS-PAGE
Placed gel #1 in coomassie Brilliant blue for 1.5 hours and destained using 30% methanol solution
Performed Western Blot with gel #2
July 17
Joe: Ligation Tet with EP*, IPTG with EP*
Transform ligations
digestion of RFP=EP^ by SpeI and Nsi
sequence RFP*-EP^
Michelle:
Run gel of SBP (SpeI and PstI)-LRP (PstI and XbaI) plasmid digested with XbaI and PstI. Ligation of SBP (SpeI and PstI)-LRP (PstI and XbaI) plasmid digested with XbaI and PstI with EP onto AMP plate followed by transformation.
Jeremiah & Chris:
Load page gels with all samples
Unable to run gel due to technical difficulties
Justin and Dafne
Develop Western blot using TMB- Microwell Peroxidase
Bands developed at 41 kDa for 0.1% overnight sample
Next stage: medium scale expression
July 18
Joe:RFP*EP^ miniprep
ligation of RFP*EP^ with SBP
Transform
Colony PCR of IPTG-Ep^ and Tet-EP^ plates
Michelle:
PCR colony check 12 colonies from yesterday’s transformation of SBP (SpeI and PstI)-LRP
(PstI and XbaI) plasmid digested with XbaI and PstI with EP on AMP plate using Forward
primer (Constitutive promoter-J32119) and Reverse primer (Lysine antisense) and ran gel.
Cultured colony #2 from transformation with SBP (SpeI and PstI)-LRP (PstI and XbaI)
digested with XbaI and PstI ligated with EP in TB-AMP
Jeremiah & Chris:
Purified and sent samples to NV Genomic Center for sequencing
TBP+++
SBP-TBPàExV
Justin and Dafne
Cultured 200 ml of SBP-B12 bacteria
July 19
Joe:     Culture IPTG colonies 1, 4, 5, 6 and TET colonies 1, 2, 3, 4 PCS RFP*-EP^
Michelle:
Miniprep cultured colony #2 from transformation of SBP (SpeI and PstI)-LRP (PstI and XbaI)
digested with XbaI and PstI ligated with EP from yesterday. Added Forward primer
(Constitutive promoter-J32119) and Reverse Primer (Lysine antisense) for sequencing at Nevada Genomic Center.
Digest colony #2 from transformation of SBP (SpeI and PstI)-LRP (PstI and XbaI) digested
with XbaI and PstI ligated with EP with enzymes, EcoRI and PstI.
Jeremiah & Chris:
Ligated TBP into SBP on the other side of the SBP than done originally (+TBP)
Justin and Dafne
Spin down culture, resuspend in lysis buffer, and lyse cells with sonicator: 8 rounds of 10 seconds on and 10 :::seconds off
Pellet
seperate supernatant from pellet
Analyze pellet and supernatant using SDS-PAGE followed by Western Blot
July 20
Joe:     PCR of RFP*-Ep^
miniprep of IPTG and TET cultures
sequencing of IPTG and TET samples
NHE digestion of samples
Michelle:
Ran gel of yesterday’s digestion with EcoRI and PstI of colony #2 from transformation of SBP
(SpeI and PstI)-LRP (PstI and XbaI) digested with XbaI and PstI ligated with EP.
Western blot transfer of 2 ml of colony #2 pellet from transformation of SBP (SpeI and PstI)-LRP (PstI and XbaI) :::digested with XbaI and PstI ligated with EP.
