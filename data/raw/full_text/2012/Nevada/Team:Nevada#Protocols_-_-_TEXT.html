6 Qiagen Miniprep kit
Bacterial Glycerol Stocks
Put 0.5mL bacterial culture in a sterile eppendorf tube.
Add 0.5mL of sterile 80% (v/v) glycerol solution
Freeze in liquid nitrogen and add to -80oC freezer
To recover, scrape frozen surface of culture with sterile inoculating needle, and then streak onto LB agar plate containing appropriate antibiotics, or inoculate liquid culture containing appropriate antibiotics.
DNA Quantification using NanoDrop Spectrophotometry
Select Nucleic Acids measurement
Initialize the NanoDrop spectrophotometer with 2µL of autoclaved H2O and wipe off
Blank (calibrate) the NanoDrop spectrophotometer with 2µL of the same elution buffer used during DNA purification and wipe off
Measure 1.5µL of DNA sample and record the concentration in ng/µL
Gel Purification of DNA (Qiagen QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit)
Cut out the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a razor blade, while minimizing the size of the gel slice
Weigh the gel slice and add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to every 1 volume of gel (100mg = 100µL)
Dissolve the gel slice using a 60°C heat block
Apply the dissolved gel to the QIAquick column and centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute
Discard the flow-through and repeat Step 4 until all sample has passed through the column
Add 500µL of Buffer QG to the QIAquick column and centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute
Wash the column with 750µL of Buffer PE and centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute
Discard the flow-through and centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute to remove residual EtOH
Transfer the QIAquick column to a new Eppendorf
Add 35µL elution buffer to the center of the column and wait at least 2 minutes
Centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute
PCR Purification of DNA
Add 5 volumes of Buffer DB to 1 volume of PCR sample
ex: Add 250µL Buffer DB to 50µL PCR sample
Apply this mixture to a QIAquick column and centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute
Discard flow-through and repeat Step 2 until all sample has passed through the column
Wash column with 750µL Buffer PE and centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute
Discard flow-through and centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute to remove residual EtOH
Transfer QIAquick column to new Eppendorf
Apply 50µL elution buffer to center of the column and wait at least 2 minutes
Centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute
Phusion PCR
Thermocycling conditions:
Initial Denaturation: 98°C for 30 seconds
25-35 cycles:
98°C for 10 seconds
55°C, 60°C, 65°C for 15 seconds
72°C for 15 seconds
Final Extension: 72°C for 5 minutes
