May 21
Michelle, Justin, and Joe:
Make Buffers P1, P2, N3, PB, and PE for QIAprep Miniprep.
May 22
Jeremiah and Chris:
Creation of competent cells and seed stocks. – For use in cloning, recombination, and transformation.
Michelle, Justin, and Joe:
Continue making Buffers for QIAprep Miniprep.
May 23
Jeremiah and Chris:
Culturing plasmids and digesting inserts out of stock plasmids to insert into SBP plasmid for culturing and recombination. Glycerol stocks of all four plasmids made. Plasmids are cultured in both LB-A broth and on plates.
SBP with EcoRI and PstI to make backbone
TBP with XbaI and PstI to make insert
Michelle, Justin, and Joe:
Continue making Buffers for QIAprep Miniprep
May 24
Jeremiah and Chris:
SBP, VB12, TBP, and Backbone digests
Digestions were made of TBP using EcoRI, XbaI, and PstI to be used as insert into SBP plasmid cut with SpeI and PstI. Parts were ligated together creating a cloning plasmid with both SBP and TBP.
Michelle and Joe:
Miniprep SBP (Starch-Binding Protein) and LRP (Lysine-Rich Protein).
Digest SBP with enzymes SpeI, and PstI.
Digest LRP with enzymes PstI, and XbaI.
May 25
Jeremiah, Joe, Justin, Michelle, and Cody:
SBP digestions and ligations of other various genes (LRP, Thiamine, Vitamin B12) to SBP individually.
