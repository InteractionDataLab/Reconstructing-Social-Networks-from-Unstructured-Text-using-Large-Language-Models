September 10
Michelle:
Single colony isolation of M2-BL21 from LB AMP-CM stock plate, which was followed by culturing it in 10ml LB :::AMP-CM broth and then large scale culturing with 50ml of LB AMP-CM broth.
Justin and Dafne:
Proteins were separated from cells (as done before)
Suspended in Amylose column buffer
proteins were purified using Amylose Resin High Flow (NEB)
eluted using 1M glycine: pH 10 buffer
September 11
Joe:
harvest protein from RFP-SBP
Justin and Dafne
Concentrate protein using Desalting column
Jeremiah & Chris:
Express BL21 cells by use of a L. Arabanose gradient
Took and 8 hour and overnight time sample
September 12
·         Run samples on a polyacrylamide gel ·         Western blot protocol
September 13
Joe:     Add rice to purified protein, incubate for 5 hours
Not enough protein - did not work
Michelle:
Glycerol stocked M2-BL21 before large scale culturing M2-BL21 with 50ml LB AMP-CM broth.
September 14
Joe: make 10, 10 ml cultures of RFP-SBP in Top10 cells
Michelle:
Transformed M2 (SBP-LRP) into BL21 cells and plated on LB AMP-CM plates.
Jeremiah & Chris:
Develop western        No band appeared because the BL21 cells needed to be grown in Ampicillin (Amp) and Chloramphenicol (Cm) antibiotics        Minipreped fresh expression plasmid with TBP+ from BL21 culture        Ran on a gel (gel #193)        Transform plasmid into new BL21 cells        Use Amp and Cm antibiotics when plating        Prepare submission plasmid (pBP31C)        Miniprep and digest in large quantities as to have enough for the other groups
Chris and Jeremiah:
Colony PCR check 5 samples
Ran on a gel (gel #195)
