Future Safety
In the future, we will conduct a variety safety checks to ensure that our iRICE is safe for human consumption. We will conduct feeding studies in small animals to test safety and measure immune responses. Currently, we know that of the nutrients we are experimenting with (Vitamin B12, Thiamine, or Lysine) are non-toxic even if overdosed just non-lethal side effects including diarrhea, stomach pains, and kidney stones [1].
Researcher, Public, and Environmental Safety
The genes used in our experiments pose no danger to both research and public personnel’s health and safety. The genes we are experimenting are unmodified E. coli genes and should pose no threat to human health if standard operating and safety practices are maintained. If our plasmids were to be released into the environment, they would not be able to survive because they require essential nutrition in order to survive. The plasmids contain no known biological threat; however, proper care and disposal of the plasmid constructs were practiced to ensure no accidental release could occur. Plasmids were heat killed before being disposed. This includes anything exposed to the bacterial cells.
BioBrick Safety
None of our BioBrick parts should raise any safety issue. All the working parts: promoters, terminator, etc. come from the iGEM 2012 kit.
Environmental, Health, and Safety Standards at UNR
In compliance with safety regulations, each team member underwent both general safety training and recombinant safety training at University of Nevada, Reno. UNR follows the OSHA environmental health and safety standards.  Lab safety consisted of proper use and care of lab equipment, proper waste disposal, and maintaining a safe work environment. More information regarding chemical hygiene can be found at http://www.ehs.unr.edu/Documents/ChemicalHygienePlan.pdf . Recombinant DNA safety training emphasized the handling and proper disposal of recombinant organisms, as well as the proper handling of genetically altered DNA. More information regarding biosafety can be found at http://www.ehs.unr.edu/Documents/UNRBiosafetyManual.pdf .
Lab Safety
Staining of the DNA called for the use of ethidium bromide which is known to be a mutagen and possibly a carcinogen. Ethidium bromide is an intercalating agent and dye that binds double stranded DNA. When handling ethidium bromide, Team Nevada iGEM recognizes the potential hazards and wears protective clothing, including close-toed shoes, disposable  gloves, goggles and lab coats. A separate waste container for ethidium bromide is present to place pipette tips, gloves, and gels stained with ethidium bromide when finished.
When screening gels, ultraviolet light was used. We recognized the dangers of exposure to UV light so we made certain we had proper protection to minimize exposure. This includes wearing lab coats, face shields, and gloves to make sure there was no exposure of skin, as well as using a plexiglass cover on the UV light source.
When handling bacterial products, our team members were careful to make sure nothing exposed was contaminated. This included working in an isolated environment and proper clean-up prior and after usage. Diluted bleach, sodium hypochlorite, was used to clean bacteria infected dishware after experiments. Also, bacteria contaminated tools in were place in biohazard waste containers and autoclaved for 1 hour prior to disposal.
