June 4
Jasmine:
Created primer stocks for J23116 Promoter, Terminator, RFP sense, RFP antisense
Used Phusion PCR to create expression plasmid (EP) and RFP gene
Michelle and Joe:
PCR colony check of transformation SBP (SpeI and PstI) and LRP (PstI and XbaI)
Cultured two colonies that expressed the brightest bands on the gel with Terrific Broth-Kanamyacin (TB-KAN) overnight.
Jeremiah & Chris:
Prepared new primers for PCR.
Colony PCR of SBP-TBP
Antisense: TBP-anti534 , Sense: SBP-sense124
Justin and Dafne:
Ligate B12 into SBP.
June 5
Michelle and Joe:
Miniprep and prepared cultures colonies #1 and #2 from transformation SBP (SpeI and PstI)and LRP (PstI and XbaI).
Jeremiah & Chris:
Purification of TSAP-SBP
PCR of SBP-TBP, then culture in stocks #3 & #4 TB broth for twenty-three hours.
June 6
Jasmine:
PCR Purified EP and RFP
Digested EP with DpnI
Self-ligated EP
Michelle and Joe:
Digest colonies #1 and #2 from transformation SBP (SpeI and PstI) and LRP (PstI and XbaI)with enzymes SpeI and XbaI.
Jeremiah & Chris:
Digested sample #4 for use in expression plasmids with RFP with XbaI and SpeI
Cultured samples #1 & #2, PCR of #2
Antisense: TBP-anti534 , Sense: SBP-sense124
Sample #2 sent to NV genomic center for sequencing
Justin and Dafne:
Transform SBP-B12 ligation into TOP10 E. coli cells
June 7
Jasmine:
Transformed ligated EP into competent cells
Plated cells onto Amp plate
Michelle and Joe:
Digest SBP + LRP with SpeI and PstI.
Digest Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) with XbaI and PstI and also with EcoRI and PstI.
Jeremiah & Chris:
Digestion of SBP-TBP – will be combined with VB12 binding protein with SpeI & PstI
Cultured more of sample #4 SBP-TBP – will be used for all future stock
Justin and Dafne:
Colony  check-PCR of SBP-B12 colonies
Culture successful colonies in TB-kana
June 8
Michelle and Joe:
Check digests: SBP + LRP with SpeI and PstI, RFP with XbaI and PstI, and RFP backbone with EcoRI and PstI.
PCR purification of RFP (XbaI and PstI).
Digest SBP + LRP with EcoRI and PstI.
Jeremiah & Chris:
Digestion with EcoRI and PstI of SBP-TBP to be ligated with RFP
Digestion of VB12 with XbaI and PstI to be ligated into SBP-TBP
Justin and Dafne:
Miniprep cultures, run on 1.2% agarose gel to confirm successful plasmid transformation
Once confirmed, digest SBP-B12 plasmid with Xba I and Pst I HF
Digest overnight
