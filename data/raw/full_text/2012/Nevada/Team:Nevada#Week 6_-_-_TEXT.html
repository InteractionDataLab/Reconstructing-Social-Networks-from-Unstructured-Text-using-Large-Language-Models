June 25
Jasmine:
Cultured more EP in TB-Amp
Michelle and Joe:
Re-run PCR colony samples of RFP-TA colony #2 (XbaI and PstI) transformation from 6/22.
Cultured colonies #7, 8, 9 from PCR colony samples RFP-TA colony #2 (XbaI and PstI) with TB-AMP.
Transformation of ligation of SBP + LRP (XbaI, EcoRI, SpeI, and PstI) with EP from 6/22 on X-gal + AMP plate.
Jeremiah & Chris:
Transformation of SBP-TBP-VB12
Justin and Dafne:
At this point, the unsuccessful nature of our project lead to the restart from the point of ligating SBP-B12 insert into the expression plasmid
New Miniprep buffers were used
New ligase was used
June 26
Jasmine:
Miniprepped new EP cultures
Digested EP with SpeI
Michelle and Joe:
Check transformation of SBP + LRP (XbaI, EcoRI, SpeI, and PstI) with EP on X-gal + AMP plate.
June 27
Jasmine, Joe, and Michelle:
Run EP digest on agarose gel to check
Created primer stocks for new RFP (RFP*), new EP (EP*), and new controlled promoter (CP): RFP*-sense-SPEI-NsiI, RFP*-anti-PstI, EP*-sense-NsiI, EP*-anti-SpeI, CP-sense-EcoRI, CP-anti-SpeI
Amplified EP* using Phusion PCR
Blunted EP* with Blunting Enzyme
Jeremiah & Chris:
Colony PCR of transformation from 6/25 (gel 040) – good yield on all lanes
Cultured samples 1 & 8
Phusion PCR of SBP-TBP in expression vector
Justin and Dafne:
SBP “fusion” into SBP-B12 plasmid.
SBP-B12 was digested using Xba I and Pst I HF
PCR was used to add 15 bp to the end of both SBP and the open SBP-B12 plasmid
This process allowed for the annealing of SBP and SBP-B12 to occur without the normal ligation process
SBP-B12 insert was also ligated into the new expression plasmid using this technique
June 28
Jasmine, Joe, and Michelle:
Self-ligated blunted EP*
Transformed EP* into competent cells and plated onto Amp plate
Jeremiah & Chris:
Purified samples of 1 and 8 of SBP-TBP-VB12
1 – 194ng/ul  #2 – 239ng/ul
Samples 1 and 8 sent to NV Genomic Center for Sequencing
Purified LRP already digested (XbaI and PstI)
SBP-TBP-VB12 (TBP++) digested to ligate with LRP
Ligation of LRP à TBP++
Justin Emlen:
Transform the SBP-B12 insert in the expression plasmid into TOP 10 competent cells
June 29
Jasmine, Joe, and Michelle:
Checked 8 EP* colonies with colony PCR
Cultured colonies 2 and 6 in TB-Amp
Amplified RFP* and CP using PCR
Digested RFP* with SpeI, PstI, and DpnI
Jeremiah & Chris:
Transformation of LRP-TBP++
Phusion transformation of SBP-TBP à expression plasmid on LB-Amp
Justin and Dafne:
Colony PCR check SBP-B12 insert in expression plasmid
Three successful colonies were obtained
Culture colonies in 6 ml of TB-amp
