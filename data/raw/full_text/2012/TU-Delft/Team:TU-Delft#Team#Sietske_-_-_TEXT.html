Sietske Grijseels
My name is Sietske Grijseels and I just started with the Master Life Science and Technology in Delft. During the iGEM competition I mainly focus on the wetlab work. I started with iGEM because I was really curious about synthetic biology and the possibilities of standardization in biology. See you in Boston!
