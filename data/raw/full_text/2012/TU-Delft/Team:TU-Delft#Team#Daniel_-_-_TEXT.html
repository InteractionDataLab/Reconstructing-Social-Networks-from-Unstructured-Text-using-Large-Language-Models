The topic of my PhD is the development of techniques for top-down and bottom-up approaches for synthetic biology in yeast, because I'm part of the Industrial Microbiology Section the focous is on the construction and caractherization of relevant phenotypes for industry. Since, this is the first time that TUDelft's team is working with yeast, I've been helping them during my free-time.
