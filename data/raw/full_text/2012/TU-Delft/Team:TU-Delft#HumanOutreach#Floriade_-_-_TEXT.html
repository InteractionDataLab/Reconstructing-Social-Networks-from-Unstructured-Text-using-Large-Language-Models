Floriade
Floriade is a World Horticultural Exposition. World expositions are major international exhibitions that have been taking place across the world since 1851. They offer countries the opportunity to showcase their economic, social, cultural and technical developments. An expo often leaves behind it a legacy building, like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Atomium in Brussels and the Euromast after the 1960 edition of Floriade.
We were invited to the Floriade to give a biology workshop at the Kids House, the day it was opened by the Dutch Minister Verhagen (Economic Affairs, Agriculture & Innovation). The Kids House is an example of bio-based building. ”All building materials used are green and can be fully recycled,” said Verhagen. The walls are made from pressed straw, its roof from vegetable oil, and the wall sockets from bioplastic. But instead of being recycled, the house will go on tour through the Netherlands after the Floriades ends.
