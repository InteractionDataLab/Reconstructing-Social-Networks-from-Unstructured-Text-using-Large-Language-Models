Stability and Sensitivity Analysis
System analysis
Stability analysis
Biological systems are usually robust against changes in environmental conditions. However, in almost all biological systems, certain parameters are subject to tight control and even small deviations result in malfunction or even death of the system.
Sensitivity analysis
Values can be tuned: initial concentration of Ste2, Vht2hd, VGa2ht, VGFPmRNAsyn
