Hey, after finishing chemical engineering studies in Turkey, I got my PhD on computational biology, at TUDelft and topped this with Bioinformatics post-doc. I am interested in the study of biological systems, because they exhibit emergent system properties (1+1!=2), and adapt to their environments. As for my interest in iGEM, I simply am curious and love education: very good combination for iGEM. I like to meet young minds and usually end up learning more from them than teach :)
