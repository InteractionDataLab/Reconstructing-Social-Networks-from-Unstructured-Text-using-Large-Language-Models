Analysis of Growth retention by addition of alpha pheromone
Introduction:
Alpha pheromone is a compound which induces the mating response in S. cerevisae. Promoter Fus1 is induced through a downstream cascade. Wildtype S. cerevisae and Δfar1 S. cerevisae are analyzed on growth rate when alpha pheromone is added.
Method:
Yeasts are inoculated O/N and harvested in the exponential growth phase. X cells/well are put into a 96 wells plate and a concentration gradient of alpha pheromone over the wells. A fluorometer tracks the cell density by measuring the OD600.
Results:
First background signal is substracted from the OD600 data.  The OD600, t=0  gives an indication of the initial cell density. For the wildtype yeast this is summarized in table 1. Here can be seen that the difference between the initial OD and the OD at the end of the measurement of measurement D (9 and 10) of the wildtype, is relatively low in comparison to others. This is also seen for measurement F (9 and 10) of the Δfar1 strain.

The data is averaged (duplo measurement. This give growth curves according to figure 1 and 2.
In the figures can be seen that the cells where at the end of their exponential phase, going into the starving phase (0 nM curve), starting at ~(t= 0:30:00). Therefore alpha pheromone effect can only be observed in growth curve in the first 30 minutes, too short to observe growth retention.
 
Discussion:
Growth retention can be observed in wildtype yeast when alpha pheromone is added. Also correlation in the first 4 hours between the alpha pheromone concentration and the growth retention can be observed for measurements B, C, E and F. Measurement D does not follow this correlation but this can be due too low OD600 values. The Δfar1 strain of S. cerevisae also seems to be affected by addition of alpha pheromones, but to a lower extent. This can be seen in relatively low differences of growth
