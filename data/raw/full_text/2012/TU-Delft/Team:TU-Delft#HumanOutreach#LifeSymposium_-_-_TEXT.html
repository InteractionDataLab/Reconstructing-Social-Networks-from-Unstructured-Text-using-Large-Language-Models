Life Symposium
The 14th of May the Life Symposium took place, organized by LIFE, the study association of Life, Science & Technology of the TU Delft. They invited us to talk about our project. Mark Weijers and Marcel Langelaan represented our team there and introduced our project to a high-minded audience. Many 'things to think about' came up when the visitors let their thoughts go over our project.
Two posters were designed for the LIFE symposium. One general and a more scientific poster, both to be seen here below. Click on them to enlarge.
