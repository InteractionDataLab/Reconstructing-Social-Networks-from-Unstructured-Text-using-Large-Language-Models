When people say iGEM, they also say synthetic biology. My first impression when I heard about iGEM was: ’’that seems really awesome iGEM, but what is synthetic biology? I only followed high school biology, help!’’
I am a bachelor student with a major in Aerospace Engineering. My tasks in this team are taking care of the Human Practice, doing some minipreps in the lab, and being the team manager. Besides a fulltime summer spending on iGEM, I like to do gymnastics and salsa dancing.
