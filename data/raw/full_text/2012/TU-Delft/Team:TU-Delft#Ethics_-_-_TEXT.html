Ethics
We did two different project on the field of ethics
Working together with humanist Daan Schuurbiers
Rathenau Debate 'Meeting of Young Minds'
We are working together with Daan Schuurbiers, the director of a consultancy for responsible innovation. Daan's main contribution was to make the team aware of the social sciences of the research. Which is so important for our potential tuberculosis diagnosing method.
We also proposed a debate for the Meeting of Young Minds, organized by the Rathenau institute, on the first day of the Jamboree. We held a debate about the H5N1 research and whether scientific research may be censored. With this debate we won the Meeting of Young Minds Award!
