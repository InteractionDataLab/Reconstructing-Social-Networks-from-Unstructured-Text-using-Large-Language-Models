An exciting moment! Last check: are all the illegal restriction sites removed, is the gene in frame, is it codon-optimized, do we have the prefix and the suffix... yes? GO!</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 24</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">We transformed the competent cells with pUC19 cells. This led to an equivalent amount of colonies in the positive and negative plate. Competent cells were made again. The top-10 cells with plasmids were grown in liquid LB and with a midiprep the plasmids were purified. We checked the vectors with DpnI and prefix/suffix enzymes, this led to results as expected. This week we investigated the possibility of growing yeasts and bacteria in the same culture using bacteriostatins to regulate bacterial growth (which grows quicker). We inoculated bacteria and yeasts separately in liquid YPD with tetracyclin and observed the growth curve using OD600. This led to a nice correlation of concentration and growth speed for bacteria, where yeast cells weren’t affected.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 25</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Synthesized banana receptors came in! Competent cells where checked and no growth was detected, we decided to transform cells anyway with the banana receptor vectors (IDT smartAMP backbone). This led to a positive outcome and we picked colonies and grew them and isolated the plasmids. Primers were designed to generate a knock-out cassette for the genes ATF1, FAR1 and GPA1 with the pUG73 and pUG72 vectors. Also primers were designed around the multiple cloning site of pRS to check inserts.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 26</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Primers arrived. Restriction of the banana receptors was performed. Vector pRS305 and two banana receptors were cut with EcoRI and PstI. The product was put on gel and the gel band with the proper size was cut out and purified. Then a ligation step was performed and the ligation product was transformed in Top10 cells. This didn’t give colonies. We tried the ligation step again and the second time it did lead to colonies. A colony was picked, grown in selective liquid media and after a day the plasmid was purified. A PCR reaction using the primers which checks the insert was performed. This didn’t led to results. A PCR reaction using pFX polymerase to amplify the pUG73 cassette with knock-out flanks also didn’t lead to results after a few tries. New primers (shorter ones) were ordered and also the pRS305 primers were redesigned to anneal ~200 bp from the multiple cloning site for optimal sequencing. Preparation for transformation of yeast cells with the knock-out cassette was performed. Further the I7 and I7-olf10 genes where amplified with a PCR reaction which flanks the gene with a kozak sequence and BamHI and NdeI sites. This facilitates the implementation of the gene between the promoter and terminator. Also the synthesized banana receptor genes where cut, gel extracted and ligated into the backbone. This led to many false positives. We performed the ligation step again and this time we confirmed the insert through restriction.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 27</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">We found out that pRS305 isn’t usable in our system since the leucine gene is completely removed in our strain and there is no origin of amplification for yeast on our plasmid. Therefore we ordered pRS315 and we contacted Mark Chee to see whether he could send us the renewed pRSII415 vectors which are also Biobrick compatible. G alpha pieces A and B arrived (the company couldn’t make it as a whole, so it is chopped up in pieces A, B, C and D). They were transformed in Top10 cells, grown and purified. When performing a restriction check we came to the conclusion a mistake had been made. The second time (same story) the bands of the restriction check where fine. New primers arrived to make the knockout cassette. A PCR with pFX polymerase to make the knock-out cassette was performed again. This time Gpa1 was successfully amplified. Yeast cells were grown and transformed with help of Daniel Solis Escalante. The cells where transformed with the gel purified Gpa1 knock-out DNA. After 2 days 3 colonies where seen and the colonies where grown in deficient media.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 28</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Mark was at a festival here, so it was a bit more quiet in the lab.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 29</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">We got microscopy training! Mark, Sietske, Lizah, Eftychia, Marcel, Yifan and Menno were there! Daniel Lam was kind to show us around in the microscopy section of the Nanotechnology building of the university. There we performed a shmoo test (adding alpha factor in a yeast environment), but due to long waiting times the yeast cells didn’t seem shmoo-ish. The I7-receptor was ligated into the IDT vector which had a constitutive promoter (GPD) and terminator. We performed a few rounds of PCR on the yeast knock-out colonies. To see whether our method of preparing was correct we checked also with EukIF and Euk563 primers. This led to a positive result. Varying annealing conditions didn’t lead to results.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 30</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">The colonies of the knock-out where checked again using PCR on the yeast colonies. After a few rounds bands where seen as expected. For this to occur we had to extract the genomic DNA first by beading. We stored the Mat a  –gpa1 –fus1 strain. We further experimented with PCR condition to make an ATF1 and GPA1 knockout cassette (to complete the universal platform study). Also we cloned the banana receptor in the pRS415 vector, but no insert was seen. Because we concluded it is hard to distinguish between a single and double cut (very close together when put on a gel for extraction), we took one positive colony (with insert) and use that as template for further cloning.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 31</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Mark was at Berlin and Warsaw here, so it was a bit more quiet in the lab.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 32</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">A banana receptor and HKUST I7-olf10 transformed yeast cells were checked on presence of plasmid by PCR on the yeast colonies. This led to positive results. To continue we performed a transformation with the niacin receptor, another banana receptor in –far1 knockout yeast and a wildtype strain. To get a nice representation and conclusion of our knockout strain –far1, -gpa1 we’ve performed a PCR using genomic DNA of the yeast. Further we have begun cloning yeast Biobrick genes mOrange and Venus YFP to get multiple color outputs. First a PCR reaction with pFX polymerase and the biobrick is performed to add res. Enz. Sites to the gene.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 33</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">We used a technique called TOPO cloning to attach the PCR product (elongated color gene) into a backbone for easier cutting. After ligation these products are transformed. This resulted in colonies for mOrange, but not for YFP. The EGFP-TOPO is cut but very vague bands could be seen when put on gel. Therefore EGFP is amplified again in Top10 cells and isolated. <SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 34</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">EGFP in Topo is cut with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into two vectors, pRS415II between promoter GPD and terminator CYC1 and in IDT-smartAmp between promoter FUS1 and terminator ADH1. Transformation of the ligation product led to colonies which were checked on inserts using EGFP primers. 
Further, yeast cells containing I7-olf10 receptor and one of the banana receptor plasmid where grown and plasmids were isolated (using zymolase) and used for PCR reaction to see whether the receptor gene was still intact. This wasn’t the case, the insert has shortened from 1500 to ~500 nt. With the banana receptors 3 bands could be distinguished (original, somewhat shortened and the ~500 nt band). We have decided to immediately after transformation inoculate a grown colony of yeast and freeze it after a day. From there we only have to use that strain.</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 42</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">Succeding better localization in the membrane! </SPAN></SPAN></DIV><DIV id="modelling-column"><SPAN class="notebook-txt"><H1 style="color:#fe2626;"><EM><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:TU-Delft/brainstorming" target="_blank">brainstorming session</A></EM></H1></SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-weekno">Week 23</SPAN><SPAN class="notebook-txt">The diffusion model is complete and will be adapted according to the
