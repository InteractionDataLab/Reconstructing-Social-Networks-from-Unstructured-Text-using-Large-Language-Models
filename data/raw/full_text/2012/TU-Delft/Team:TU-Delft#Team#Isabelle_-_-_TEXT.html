Hi all! iGEM came along on my blackboard page and I decided to have a look.. I am a bachelor student in Maritime Engineering, so I basically study steel and water and there is not a lot of DNA involved. But I strongly believe in combining knowledge of different fields, so I had a look and applied! Before I knew it, I was surrounded by biologists, chemists and control engineering students! Especially the lab is filled with miracles for me, it is very exciting to see what synthetic biology can do! This project convinced me even more of the fact a multidisciplinary team has a lot of potential and gives every team member an oppurtunity to learn in other fields of science.
