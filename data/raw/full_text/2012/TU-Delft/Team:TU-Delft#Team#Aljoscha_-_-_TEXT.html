Hi there! My research focuses on intracellular regulation, especially metabolic functions. During my master thesis I was fascinated by 13C tracer techniques that allow a quantitative insight to metabolic fluxes. It is amazing to observe how cells can adapt to their environment and even more exciting to extend their capabilities. Synthetic biology and iGEM extend to genetic and regulatory levels and I am curious how much we can learn and develop in-silico and in the lab. iGEM is fun and challenge!
Looking forward to a great Jamboree!
