Dear all,
My name is Eftychia and I am the Greek girl of the team :) I came to TUDelft to do a Master in Bioinformatics. I learned about iGem competition after a mail, that I received from my master’s coordinator, Mr. Marcel Reinders.
My willingness to adapt to the culture of the Dutch University, my curiosity for further knowledge and my wonder about how my work can be combined with Biologists’ work, led to my application to iGem. Before realizing it, I was an active member of the TUDelft iGem team!!
I really enjoy working with people with different background, different habits and different ideas for the same project. By this way, I learn many things everyday and I see things from many different perspectives.  As a Bioinformatician the chance to see in practice what Synthetic Biology is about, how Biologists work and how my knowledge can contribute to their work, is really invaluable!
My main tasks in the iGem team are the development of the wiki page, sequence alignment and support to the Structural model of Snifferomyces.
