Your title
Rob Carlson
Dr. Carlson earned a doctorate in Physics from Princeton University in 1997. At the broadest level, Rob is interested in the future role of biology as a human technology. He has worked to develop new biological technologies in both academic and commercial environments, focusing on molecular measurement and microfluidic systems. Carlson is the author of the book Biology is Technology: The Promise, Peril, and New Business of Engineering Life, published in 2010 by Harvard University Press.
Dr. Carlson gave a lecture about 'Biology is Technology', after his book. Afterwards we had a very nice dinner, it was very inspiring to meet such an icon in synthetic biology.
