Ever since I realized the true complexity of every living cell, I never lost interest in it. By combining this interest with my Bachelor of Engineering, the choice for the mastertrack bionanoscience was pretty straight forward.
From the moment I read about bionanoscience, I wanted to see it all happening before my own eyes and see the results by practicing this study 'in the field'. Therefore, I see iGEM as a great opportunity to get (more) experience in modeling, labwork and teamwork within the biotechnological field. Also, iGEM is a unique possibility to boost my academic career.
