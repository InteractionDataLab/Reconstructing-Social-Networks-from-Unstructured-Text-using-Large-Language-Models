I am a PhD student in Delft Center for Systems and Control at TU Delft. Although I am a mathematician in my mind, I love biology and I think it is now one of the most interesting and challenging areas of application of the theory I am working on – formal verification of probabilistic systems. Moreover, working with our student team is an amazing experience which I never had before – besides of just having fun, it’s wonderful to see how the ideas, which popped up occasionally, with the time take the shape of new methods and techniques.
