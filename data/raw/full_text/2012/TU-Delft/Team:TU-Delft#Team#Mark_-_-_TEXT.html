This summer I am dedicated to the scientific aspect of the project. I am a master student in the Life Sciences in Delft, dedicated to our yeasties. Other than this I love to play and listen to all sorts of music, skateboard through the city and watch movies. I hope with this project to provide a useful tool to make yeast cells sniff around.
