Menno Witteveen
Hi! My name is Menno and I work on various aspects of our iGEM project. My special interests lie on new modeling approaches, tightly coupled with the experimental approaches of the lab. Nice examples are: Applying information theory to signaling cascades, using numerical methods for optimal experimental design, especially in the light of intercellular noise. I also do labwork, but I hope one day, that we will only have robots and microfluidics in the lab, that can do the work for us, so we can work on other more abstract problems. I also have a strong interest in personalized medicine!
