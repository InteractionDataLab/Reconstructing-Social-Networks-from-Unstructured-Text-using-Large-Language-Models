Collaborative learning
During the brainstorm sessions a MSc student in Educational studies, Amalia Ephrat had recorded the way this team came to their final topic Snifferomyces! The team helped her to study the collaborative learning activities between students with different international backgrounds within the learning context of the University
Who is Amalia Ephrat? – Our MSc students in Educational studies
Amalia Ephrat is a MSc student in Educational studies at Leiden, she     did a short internship focused on collaborative learning     activities between students with an international background within     the learning context of the university.
When students of diverse backgrounds participate in a project where     collaborative learning is important, the individual differences can     pose a series of challenges to the group processes. This is a well-     known challenge for many Dutch universities, which makes it a relevant     topic for educational research to investigate the means for     intervention and the effects of those interventions on collaborative     learning processes and outcomes.
Her plan is to improve collaborative learning amongst students of     different backgrounds, by designing research and conduct measurement     during the brainstorming phase of the project. Research shall consist     of qualitative exploratory methods using observational methods and     interviews and quantitative research using several questionnaires,     including collaborative skills, empathy and intercultural conflict     management.
The main focus of her research is the collaborative process in the     iGEM group and the efficacy of the interventions of the supervisors to     support the collaborative process in a culturally diverse group of     students.
