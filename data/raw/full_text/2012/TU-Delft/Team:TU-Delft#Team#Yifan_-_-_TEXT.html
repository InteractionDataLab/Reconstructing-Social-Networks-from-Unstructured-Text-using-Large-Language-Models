It's a wonderful experience to work with knowledgeable supervisors and excellent teammates, who don't use chopsticks though. The way we communicate as different roles, and the goal of completing a fantastic project I've never imagined before, really turns me on. It helps me to gain the insight to what we learned theoretically before, and hopefully our work will turn to be an amazing bio-machine. Come on guys!
