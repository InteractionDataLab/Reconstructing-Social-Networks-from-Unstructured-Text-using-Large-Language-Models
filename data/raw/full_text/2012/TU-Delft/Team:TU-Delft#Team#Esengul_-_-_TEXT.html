Esengul Yildirim
For several years I have been employed at Kluyver laboratory for Biotechnology at the Enzymology section as a supporting staff member on education and research.
To be an integral part of TUDelft’s iGEM supervisor team gives me the unique chance to apply different facets of my own education to this year's interdisciplinary team. Next to this it’s a challenge to use my technical knowledge and distinctive expertise with membrane associated research to support and tutor an inspired group of upcoming synthetic biologists.
In addition, I supervise several Bachelor and Master students that are doing their internship at my department. I'm looking forward to the European Jamboree in Amsterdam and see all the fascinating and challenging work done at iGEM!  See you all there!! ;)
