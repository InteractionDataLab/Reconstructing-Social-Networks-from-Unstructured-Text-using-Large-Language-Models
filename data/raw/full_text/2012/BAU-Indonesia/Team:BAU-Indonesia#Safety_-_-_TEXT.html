Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in                             terms of:
Researcher Safety
We have isolated and cultured the bacteria sample from landfill                             at Galuga, West Java Indonesia. To prevent contamination by some                             harmfull bacteria, we have followed the instruction of safety                             procedure, such as using sensigloves, mask, and washing hand                             after sampling. Hazardous chemicals that we used are aclrilamide                             and ethidium bromyde. Acrylamide (or acrylic amide) is a simple                             organic compound with the chemical formula C3H5NO. It's                             potentially hazardous to health (cancer or carcinogenic).                             Acrylamide can form long polymer chains known as polyacrylamide,                             which is also carcinogenic. Inhalation: irritation,                             disorientation, burning, convulsions. Contact with skin:                             irritation, disorientation. Eye contact: irritation, a burning                             sensation of the eyes, eye damage.              Ethidium bromide will reduce the rate of migration of linear DNA                             molecules by 15%. This solution is extremely dangerous and                             carcinogenic. All solutions which contained ethidium bromide                             should be decontaminated before disposal. Ethidium Bromide                             (EtBr) will fluoresce under UV exposure. These dyes can be added                             to the gel and buffer so there is no staining after                             electrophoresis process. The advantage is more practical, but                             the possibility of EtBr contamination is greater. Due to the                             carcinogenic factor, it must be avoided for direct contact.
Public Safety
We have ethics to minimize the danger possibility to public. We                             usually wear single-used gloves, covered shoes, lab coat, and                             mask so the accumulation of materials and impurities are not                             exposed to participant directly. We have a liquid discharge                             valves which equipped with running water, so it won't settle. We                             also have a separated solid waste disposal for potentially                             hazardous materials. Those ethics are rules in our work on this                             project.
Environmental Safety
No harmful effect on our enzyme product. E. coli bacteria which                             inserted by  Cutinase gene has been set for its life period by                             sonicator so there'll no blooming act in nature. Destruction of                             PET by using our products is done at indoor laboratory so the                             waste does not impact to the environment directly. The enzyme                             does not cause further effect especially for chemical / physical                             danger.No harmful effect on our enzyme product.

The enzyme does not cause further effect especially                              for chemical / physical danger.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you                             made this year raise safety issues? If yes, Did you document these issues in the Registry?
No, we didn't document the safety issue to the registry, but our                             procedure was according the Standard Operational Procedure of                             Molecular Biology Laboratory and Microbiology laboratory in IPB                             (Bogor Agricultural University). So we think our project hasn't                             any safety risk during we follow the procedure carefully.
How did you manage to handle the safety issue?
To handle the security issue of our work, we always consult with                             the team advisor and instructor who handle the laboratory                             security work in IPB. Our security is guaranteed by following                             the standard operating procedures which provided in each                             laboratory. As a mechanism to ensure the safety of our work,                             first of all we started it by product testing step in the                             laboratory before applying it in nature, so when the result is                             guaranteed safely, it can be applied in nature.
How could other teams learn from your experience?
Other teams can learn from the procedure that we have used. We                             use the common procedure that is used by molecular researchers                             at the laboratory, so its safety has been tested (as long as we                              follow the standard operation procedure had been given).
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review                             board at your institution?
Which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to                             consider in your country?
We have no local biosafety committee at our institution but                             there are Biosafety rules or guidelines in our country. Please                             see below :

11. Biosafety Technical Team In the establishment                             process.
12. Biosafety Clearing House Regarding Article 20 of the Cartagena Protocol, Indonesia has been establish a Biosafety                             Clearing House to facilitate the exchange of scientific,                             technical , environmental and legalinformation on LMO. BCH is                             coordinated by Ministry of Environment in cooperation with                             Indonesia Institute of Science Secretariat of Biosafety                             Commission.
13. Law 32/2009. Every activities may create important risk                             on environment, biodiversity and human healthand human safety                             have to carry out Environmental Risk Analysis, Risk Assessment,                              Risk Management, Risk Communication.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety                                   issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How                                   could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through                                    biosafety engineering?
To ensure the biosafety, it will be better to give more                                   certification letter about the safety of materials which                                   provided to the participants. Each institution must have their                                   own fire fighters and laboratory clinic centre.                 To minimize the hazardous chemicals we can use the synthetic                                   biology engineered system. The equipment which is used is fairly                                   easy to control for these biosafety ethics. The example of                                   recommended system that has better security is JSA (Job Safety                                   Analyst).
