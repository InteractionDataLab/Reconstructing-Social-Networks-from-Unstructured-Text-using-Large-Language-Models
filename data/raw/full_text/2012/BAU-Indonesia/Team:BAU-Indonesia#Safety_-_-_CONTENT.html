Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in 
									    
									    terms of:
                                        
                                        </STRONG></H3><H4><STRONG>Researcher Safety</STRONG></H4><H4>We have isolated and cultured the bacteria sample from landfill 
									    
									    at Galuga, West Java Indonesia. To prevent contamination by some 
									    
									    harmfull bacteria, we have followed the instruction of safety 
									    
									    procedure, such as using sensigloves, mask, and washing hand 
									    
									    after sampling. Hazardous chemicals that we used are aclrilamide 
									    
									    and ethidium bromyde. Acrylamide (or acrylic amide) is a simple 
									    
									    organic compound with the chemical formula C3H5NO. It's 
									    
									    potentially hazardous to health (cancer or carcinogenic). 
									    
									    Acrylamide can form long polymer chains known as polyacrylamide, 
									    
									    which is also carcinogenic. Inhalation: irritation, 
									    
									    disorientation, burning, convulsions. Contact with skin: 
									    
									    irritation, disorientation. Eye contact: irritation, a burning 
									    
									    sensation of the eyes, eye damage.
									    Ethidium bromide will reduce the rate of migration of linear DNA 
									    
									    molecules by 15%. This solution is extremely dangerous and 
									    
									    carcinogenic. All solutions which contained ethidium bromide 
									    
									    should be decontaminated before disposal. Ethidium Bromide 
									    
									    (EtBr) will fluoresce under UV exposure. These dyes can be added 
									    
									    to the gel and buffer so there is no staining after 
									    
									    electrophoresis process. The advantage is more practical, but 
									    
									    the possibility of EtBr contamination is greater. Due to the 
									    
									    carcinogenic factor, it must be avoided for direct contact.</H4><H4><STRONG>Public Safety</STRONG></H4><H4>We have ethics to minimize the danger possibility to public. We 
									    
									    usually wear single-used gloves, covered shoes, lab coat, and 
									    
									    mask so the accumulation of materials and impurities are not 
									    
									    exposed to participant directly. We have a liquid discharge 
									    
									    valves which equipped with running water, so it won't settle. We 
									    
									    also have a separated solid waste disposal for potentially 
									    
									    hazardous materials. Those ethics are rules in our work on this 
									    
									    project. </H4><H4><STRONG>Environmental Safety</STRONG></H4><H4> No harmful effect on our enzyme product. E. coli bacteria which 
									    
									    inserted by  Cutinase gene has been set for its life period by 
									    
									    sonicator so there'll no blooming act in nature. Destruction of 
									    
									    PET by using our products is done at indoor laboratory so the 
									    
									    waste does not impact to the environment directly. The enzyme 
									    
									    does not cause further effect especially for chemical / physical 
									    
									    danger.No harmful effect on our enzyme product. E. coli bacteria 
									    
									    which inserted by  Cutinase gene has been set for its life 
									    
									    period by sonicator so there'll no blooming act in nature.

									    directly. The enzyme does not cause further effect especially 
									    
								      for chemical / physical danger.
									  </H4><H3><STRONG>2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you 
									    
									    made this year raise safety issues? If yes, Did you document these issues in the Registry?</STRONG></H3><H4>No, we didn't document the safety issue to the registry, but our 
									    
									    procedure was according the Standard Operational Procedure of 
									    
									    Molecular Biology Laboratory and Microbiology laboratory in IPB 
									    
									    (Bogor Agricultural University). So we think our project hasn't 
									    
									    any safety risk during we follow the procedure carefully.</H4><H4><STRONG>How did you manage to handle the safety issue?</STRONG></H4><H4> To handle the security issue of our work, we always consult with 
									    
									    the team advisor and instructor who handle the laboratory 
									    
									    security work in IPB. Our security is guaranteed by following 
									    
									    the standard operating procedures which provided in each 
									    
									    laboratory. As a mechanism to ensure the safety of our work, 
									    
									    first of all we started it by product testing step in the 
									    
									    laboratory before applying it in nature, so when the result is 
									    
									    guaranteed safely, it can be applied in nature.</H4><H4><STRONG>How could other teams learn from your experience?</STRONG></H4><H4> Other teams can learn from the procedure that we have used. We 
									    
									    use the common procedure that is used by molecular researchers 
									    
									    at the laboratory, so its safety has been tested (as long as we 
									    
								      follow the standard operation procedure had been given).                                      
								      </H4><H3><STRONG>3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review 
									    
									    board at your institution? </STRONG></H3><H4><STRONG>Which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to 
									    
									    consider in your country?</STRONG></H4><H4> We have no local biosafety committee at our institution but 
									    
									    there are Biosafety rules or guidelines in our country. Please 
									    
									    see below :
									    1.	Regulation Law No. 32 of 2009 about Environmental 
									    
									    Protection &amp; Management 
									    2.	Law No. 7 of 1996 on Food
									    3.	Law No. 18 of 2002 on National System

									    12.	Biosafety Clearing House Regarding Article 20 of the 
									    
									    Cartagena Protocol, Indonesia has been establish a Biosafety 
									    
									    Clearing House to facilitate the exchange of scientific, 
									    
									    technical , environmental and legalinformation on LMO. BCH is 
									    
									    coordinated by Ministry of Environment in cooperation with 
									    
									    Indonesia Institute of Science Secretariat of Biosafety 
									    
									    Commission.
									    13.	Law 32/2009. Every activities may create important risk 
									    
									    on environment, biodiversity and human healthand human safety 
									    
									    have to carry out Environmental Risk Analysis, Risk Assessment, 
									    
								      Risk Management, Risk Communication.                                                                                                                    
								      </H4><H3><STRONG>4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety 
								        
								        issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How 
								        
								        could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through 
								        
							          biosafety engineering? </STRONG></H3><H4>To ensure the biosafety, it will be better to give more 
								        
								        certification letter about the safety of materials which 
								        
								        provided to the participants. Each institution must have their 
								        
								        own fire fighters and laboratory clinic centre.
								        To minimize the hazardous chemicals we can use the synthetic 
								        
								        biology engineered system. The equipment which is used is fairly 
								        
								        easy to control for these biosafety ethics. The example of 
								        
								        recommended system that has better security is JSA (Job Safety 
								        
								        Analyst).</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV id="footer"><DIV class="row-top"><DIV class="row-padding"><DIV class="wrapper"><DIV class="col-3"><H2><B>Follow Us: </B></H2><UL class="list-services"><LI class="item-2"><A href="https://twitter.com/BAU_INDONESIA" target="_blank">Twitter (BAU-INDOESIA)</A></LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
