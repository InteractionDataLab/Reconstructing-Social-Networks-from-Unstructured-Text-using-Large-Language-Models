Bio Synthetic Pathways
Codonizer
To ensure that our modeling worked, we ran our sequences through a custom developed codon optimizer.  Try it our yourself below!  Drop in a chunk of DNA data and click "Optimize Codons" to have your sequence optimized for the acetobacter preferred codons.
Upon completion of the iGEM competition we would like to expand our Codonizer software to support other strains.  A mockup of what this tools will look like is provided below.
