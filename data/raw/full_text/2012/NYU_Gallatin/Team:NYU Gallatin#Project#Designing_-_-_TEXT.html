Gen2Seat: Genetic Generation Seat
Designing the Chair
It was always a chair, from the very first brainstorming session.  Somehow it just seemed like it fit.  What can we do with cellulose, bone, mycelium, and other squishy and hard and structural pieces found naturally in the world?  The process was a whirlwind of sketches and attempts -- everything from fruit rollups to wood chips -- until a working model started to emerge.
About the Chair
The emergence of citizen biotech must be seen within the broader context of advanced technologies becoming ever more readily available to individuals and groups. With that availability, comes enhanced opportunities to develop new ideas. We have produced the first full-scale synthetic biological chair entitled; Genetic Generation Seat or Gen2Seat. At IGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) competition, we have genetically engineered the naturally occurring bacterium Acetobacter xylinum.
This bacterium secretes copious amounts of cellulose, which can then be harvested and used directly as a building material. Alternatively, our goal is to create a novel strain that can also secrete the biopolymer chitin, which is normally produced by arthropods, such as insects and crustaceans. In addition, we fused mycelium blocks with the modified acetobactor to create a new biopolymer.  Applying the tools of synthetic biology, alongside other biological disciplines, such as microbiology and tissue engineering, will allow us to create products more organically, with minimal waste and energy expenditure.
Media: biopolymer of acetobacter, chitin, mycelium.
Size: 20"x 21"x 14".
Support/ Consultation: Ecovative Design LLC, Suzanne Lee and BioCouture.
Sponsor: NYU Gallatin.
