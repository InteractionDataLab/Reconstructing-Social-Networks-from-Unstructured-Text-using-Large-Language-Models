The Project
Gen2Seat began as a vision; a vision of fully formed seats and chairs emerging from giant vats of colorful bioengineered bacterial cellulose.  Acetobacter naturally produces mats of cellulose that can be used for a variety of purposes. We wanted to create a broader spectrum of materials, so we altered the properties of the cellulose mats by engineering Acetobacter to express enzymes that charge N-acetyl glucosamine, a subunit of chitin, with UDP which facilitates its uptake by cellulose synthetase. The result is a chitin-cellulose copolymer which may have unique properties. We have demonstrated its potential for use in modern architectural design, and plan to engineer other properties such as color, scent, etc. into the celluose as next steps.
Cloning
Learn about our cloning techniques, primer designs, protocols, and exciting adventures along the way.
Transforming
Learn about the protocols we used to insert engineered DNA into bacterial cells and observe its affects.
Growing
See how we learned to grow cellulose in Kombucha tea, and produced sheeting on a large scale.
Designing
Creating functional furniture out of completely organic materials takes creativity, flare, and a lot of awesome tools.  See the conception of a bio-composite chair design and the novel fabrication methods necessary to produce it.
Human Practices
Our human practices involved a 200+ response national survey on genetic engineering and a pop-up shop selling synthetic biology products at the Atlantic Antic street fair in Brooklyn, NY!
iGEM
The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Foundation is dedicated to education and competition, advancement of synthetic biology, and the development of open community and collaboration.
