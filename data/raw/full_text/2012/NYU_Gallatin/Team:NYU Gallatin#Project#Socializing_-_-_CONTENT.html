our project altered the cellulose produced by <I>acetobacter xylinum</I> for use as a fabrication material in consumer products. Accordingly, the human practices portion of our project focused on the consumer market for genetically modified (GM) products and sought to identify the primary demographic and psychographic predictors of approval for those products.  We used both quantitative and qualitative measures to research this question.</P><P>The quantitative measure was in the form of a ten item survey administered to a national sample via the world wide web.  The survey asked respondents whether they were aware that GM food and cotton were already sold in stores, whether they approved of GM food, clothes, fuels, and medicine, how safe they perceived GM products to be, and basic demographic information including their age, gender, and highest level of education completed. A 37 percent response rate yielded 168 usable responses, and results are reported with 95 percent confidence and a confidence interval of 7.5 percent. We found that product type, gender, and awareness of existing GM products were all predictors of approval for GM products. We also found that women were significantly less likely to approve of GM products (p
</P><P>As a qualitative measure of opinion concerning GM products, we created an artificial store selling GM products at a widely attended street festival in Brooklyn, NY and interviewed visitors concerning their perceptions of actual and hypothetical GM products on display at the store. We interviewed women in particular and found that the perception of GM products as unsafe or untrustworthy is a likely cause of disapproval for GM products.</P><H1>The Survey</H1><P>Our human practices portion consists of a study concerning relationships among awareness, education, and approval of different genetically modified products. e.g. Do people care whether cotton is genetically engineered as much as food?  The survey results were collected online as well as our shoppe at Atlantic Antic from volunteers off the street. </P><P><A href="/Team:NYU_Gallatin/Project/Socializing/Survey">Take the survey yourself!</A></P><H2 style="clear: both">Methodology</H2><UL><LI>10 item web survey regarding genetically modified (GM) products:

With tons of street traffic and several film crews documenting the day and interviewing visitors, the store was a huge success.  Check out some of the &quot;products&quot; we were selling that day.</P><H2>GMO based consumer products: Present and Future</H2><H3>Living Watch</H3><P> Â  </P><P>This biologically based oscillator is attuned not only to lunar and solar cycles, but to biological circadian rhythms as well. Housed in an organic scaffold and bezel setting, the time is digitally indicated by truly organic light emitting diodes; cells that have been genetically modified to bio-luminesce in response to oscillating genetic circuits. With a housing and strap made from laboratory grown keratinocytes and chondrocytes (a.k.a. Victimless Leather), it ensures complete biodegradability when time runs out. </P><P><I>Availability: Near Future</I></P><H3>BioCrete</H3><P> Â  </P><P>Did you know that the production of cement is a very energy intensive process and is a source of 5% of industrial CO2 emissions?  Build your foundation instead using BioCrete. A genetically engineered strain of a naturally occurring bacterium, Sporosarcina pasteurii, has been designed to secrete both calcium carbonate and spider silk proteins to generate a very durable cement to produce concrete with optimum tensile strength. The strain has also been engineered to be salt tolerant and photosynthetic. Mix with some soil and water, add the freez-dried bacteria, expose to moderate sunlight and grow your dream house!</P><P><I>Availability: Near to Far Future</I></P><H3>Microbial Fuel Cell / Engineered ProBiotics</H3><P>Always feel as if youâ��re flushing money down the drain? With the Microbial Fuel Cell, you can generate enough power to light up your home. Attaches easily to existing waste water pipes and harnesses bacteria to generate a steady and reliable output of â��Bac-tricity.â�� Naturally occurring E. coli colonize high-surface area carbon nanotube anodes and contribute electrons from their membrane surface. With our genetically modified probiotic supplement, you can â��turbo-chargeâ�� your gut microbes with probiotic strains over-expressing proteins that optimize the external transfer of electrons. These will yield up to 10 times the current flow as natural strains, ensuring that your roll-on OLED display and Xbox Holodeck doesnâ��t run out of power.

The grown photosynthetic algae harvests CO2 directly from the atmosphere and uses sunlight to biosynthesize energy packed hydrocarbons. Since the CO2 that is subsequently released from the burning of this fuel has been taken up from the atmosphere, the result is a net carbon-neutral load on the environment. New strains are being genetically engineered to produce higher yields of hydrocarbons which can be used to power everything from F-18 Hornets to the family sedan. </P><P><I>Availability: Near Future</I></P><H3>Enzyme based Cleaners</H3><P>The addition of genetically modified enzymes that degrade proteins (proteases), carbohydrates (amylases) and greases (lipases) to cleaning compounds such as detergents, surface cleaners, contact lens solutions, etc. ensures the speedy removal of accumulated dirt. In addition, enzymes function at lower temperatures, thereby reducing the need for hot water during cleaning. A sample, by no means complete, of some products that contain enzymes for cleaning purposes is on display here.</P><P><I>Availability: Now</I></P><H3>GloFish: Genetically Modified Pets</H3><P>Originally engineered at the National University of Singapore to act as a biosensor to detect pollutants in rivers, these genetically modified zebra fish have proven to be a hit at pet stores nationwide. </P><P>From <A href="http://www.glofish.com:">www.glofish.com:</A>

From the Harvard Team IGEM 2010 website:
â��The Harvard iGarden is a venture into plant engineering. Our aim is to create a toolkit for the cultivation of a personalized garden containing features introduced through synthetic biology. In addition to a &quot;genetic fence&quot; designed to prevent the spread of introduced genetic material, we have developed three independent features to be included in this toolkit - inclusion of novel flavors, knockdown of plant allergens, and modification of petal color. We envision the iGarden as a medium through which the non-scientist can see the power and potential of synthetic biology and apply it to everyday life.â��</P><P><I>Availability: Near Future</I></P><H3>Gen2Seat (Generation 2, Seat)</H3><P>Furniture that is grown using biopolymers derived from genetically modified Acetobacter strains, isolated from Kombucha, that secrete chitin, a durable material also found in insect exoskeletons. What will they think of next! Draped over an interior cushioning derived from fungal mycelia, this chair is light, sturdy and eventually compostable. This consumer item is designed to be produced using a minimum of energy expenditure and is currently being developed by the NYU-Gallatin IGEM team, along with members of Terreform One and Genspace.</P><P><I>Availability: Very Near Future</I></P><H3>BioProgrammable Paint</H3><P>Not sure what color to paint your walls? Decide later with programmable paint! Contains micro-encapsulated strains of genetically engineered B. subtilis bacteria. Each bacterium contains a series of genes cloned from various plant biosynthetic pathways that synthesize pigment molecules, such as red lycopene found in tomatoes and orange beta-carotene found in carrots. When freshly applied, the oxygen activated microbes get to work, producing a slowly changing spectrum of synchronized color on applied surfaces for up to a week, with previous pigments being degraded. When your favorite color comes into view, simply wave the enclosed UV emitting wand in the direction of the surface to disable the bacteria and lock in the color. Improved varieties of programmable paint are being worked on that will also absorb allergens and toxins such as carbon monoxide and mold spores.</P><P><I>Availability: Far Future</I></P><H3>Genetically Modified Foods</H3><P>Currently at the center of various controversies, genetically modified crops come in a range of varieties. Crops that have been developed today include varieties of maize, soy and alfalfa, that express genes from the naturally occurring soil bacterium B. thuringiensis. The expressed protein is fatal to insect larvae when they ingest the crops. Most current crops are engineered to be either pest or herbicide resistant. Future varieties of food crop plants are being engineered to have enhanced production of nutrients. Golden rice varieties have been engineered that produce beta-carotene (Viatmin A). Currently 80% of papayas grown in Hawaii are derived from a variety that has been genetically engineered to contain a gene making it resistant to papaya ringspot virus, a natural pest of the papaya plant.</P><P><I>Availability: Now</I></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></NOWIKI><DIV id="footer-wrapper"><DIV class="section"><DIV id="igem-footer" class="clearfix"><DIV class="region region-footer"><DIV id="block-block-3" class="block block-block"><H2>iGEM</H2><DIV class="content"><P>The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Foundation is dedicated to education and competition, advancement of synthetic biology, and the development of open community and collaboration. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
