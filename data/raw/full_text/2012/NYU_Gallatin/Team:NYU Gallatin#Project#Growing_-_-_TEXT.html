Growing Cellulose
Growing cellulose is like growing a giant vat of kombucha tea, in fact all of the basic ingredients are the same and if we had been brave enough to taste one of our cellulose growths perhaps we might have enjoyed what we found.  Here you'll find the adventures (and mis-adventures!) of growing cellulose as an upholstery fabric.
Small Growths
To start our experiment in harvesting cellulose on a large scale, we wanted to try out different ingredients and see which ones yielded the most product.
 
 
Large Growths
Eventually the scale and the smell were too much, and we had to construct a little cellulose growth center on the roof of our Brooklyn building.
