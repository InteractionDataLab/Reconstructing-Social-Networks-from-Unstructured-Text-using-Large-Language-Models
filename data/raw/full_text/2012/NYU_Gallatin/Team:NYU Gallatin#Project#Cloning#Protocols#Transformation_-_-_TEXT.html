Cloning:  Transformation Protocol
Thaw competent cells on ice. Not in hands.
Transfer 50 Âµl of competent cells to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. The competent cells are fragile and sensitive to temperature change, cool the microcentrifuge in the ice for a few seconds first, then be as quick as possible while transferring the cells and return them to the ice.
Add 2 Âµl of the chilled assembly product to competent cells. Mix gently by pipetting up and down or folcking the tube 4-5 times. Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for at least 30 minutes. Do not mix.
Heat shock at 42Â° C for exactly 30 seconds. Do not mix.
Add 950 Âµl of room temperature SOC media to the tube.
Place the tube at 37Â° C for 60 minutes. Shake vigorously (250 rpm) or rotate.
Warm selection plates to 37Â° C.
Spread 100 Âµl of the cells onto the plates.
Incubate overnight at 37Â° C.
