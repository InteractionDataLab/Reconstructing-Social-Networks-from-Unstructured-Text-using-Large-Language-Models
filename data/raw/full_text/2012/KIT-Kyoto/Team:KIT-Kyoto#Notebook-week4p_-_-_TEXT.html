September 13th
1-1-50 and 2-2-8 Isolating a single colony of E. coli carrying the candidate pSV1C3-UAS-LacZ or pSB1C3-HS-GAL4
We isolated colonies (one for pSB1C3-UAS-LacZ ,three for pSB1C3-HS-G4L4) and cultured in liquid medium(2.5ml LB Chloramphenicol(+)) at 37℃ for 16 hours. No transformed colony was detected for E. coli carrying the candidate pSB1C3-Act5C-GAL4.
1-2-8 Cut check for the candidate pSB1C3-UAS-LacZ and pSB1C3-UAS-EGFP
The candidate pSB1C3-UAS-LacZ and pSB1C3-UAS-EGFP DNAs (made 9/12) were digested with EcoRⅠ/ SpeⅠ and BglⅡ, respectively.
