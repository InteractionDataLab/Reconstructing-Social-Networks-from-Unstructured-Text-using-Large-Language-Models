MEETING
PROTOCOL
DESIGN NOTE
August 1st
Since it takes at least one month to establish transgenic flies, we decided to first construct the P-element plasmid for microinjection into Drosophia embryos.
We performed PCR in the following conditions.

2. DNA purification from gel
We electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gel in the following conditions.
Composition
8/1 attB TNFAIP3 PCRproduct
DNA sample
90μL
6×Dye
18μL
total
108μL
We applied half of 108 uL of sample to each of two lanes of Agaroe gel with 5uL of 1kb marker.Then we detected the DNA band in the gel.
Results
We purifed DNA from the gel by QIA Quick Gel Extraction Kit.
・Eatimation of the amount of attB TNFAIP3 DNA fragments by electrophoresis.
Order of samples applied to the agarose gel
The samples were electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gel in following order.
Right to left:3uL of 1kb marker 1uL of 5 fold dilution of attB TNFAIP3 DNA fragments,1uL of 10 fold dilution of attB TNFAIP3 DNA fragments, 1uL of 20 fold dilution of attB TNFAIP3 DNA fragments, 1uL of 1kb marker.
Results
We have estimated amount of the attB TNFAIP3 DNA to be 80ng/uL.

1. BP reaction
BP reaction was carried out in the following conditions.
attB TNFAIP3(80ng/μL)
1μL
pDONR(455ng/μL)
0.35μL
TE buffer
7.65
total
9μL
One uL of BP Clonase Ⅱ enzyme mix was added to this solution and incubated for 2.5 hours.
2. Transformation of E.coli by BP reaction products
2uL of BP TNFA reaction product was added to 100uL of E.coli XL1-Blue to do transform ation.
At last, cells were divided into 10,40,100,and 200 uL,and spreaded on LB Kanamycin(+)plate,Plats wera incubated for 16 hours at 37°C.
August 4th
Four independent 4 colonies were picked up from the plate incubated from 8/3 as described in ②,then cultured in 2.5mL of LB Kanamycin(+) liquid culture medium for 16 hours.
August 5th
Plasmid DNAs were isolated from E.coli cultured in 4 of LB liquid culture medium which we made on 8/4 by the alkaline-lysis method, we added the DNA to 20uL TE and added 10uL of the solution to 2uL of 6×Dye. Then we electrophoresed it with marker, 2uL of pDONR+ 2uL of 6×Dye+ 8uL of TE,in 0.7% agarose gel in following order (from left to right)
Left control pDONR DNA, BP TNFA-1,-2,-3,-4
Results
August 6th
E.coli carrying the plasmid sample -1 and -2 in LB Kanamycin(+)liquid culture medium for 16 hours.
August 7th
1. Purification of candidate pENTR-TNFAIP3
We purified candidate plasmid-1 and -2 by QIA Prep Spin Miniprep Kit, dissolved  it in 30uL of Buffer EB.
Then,the samples were electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gel.
We made samples as follows.
