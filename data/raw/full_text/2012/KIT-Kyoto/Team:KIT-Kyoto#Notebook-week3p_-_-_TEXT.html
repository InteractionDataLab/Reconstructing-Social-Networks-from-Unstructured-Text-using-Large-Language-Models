At 20 min after removing the medium, 25 uL of serum free medium containing the 1 uL of siLentfect and 200 ng each of pAct5C-GAL4 DNA and pUAS-EGFP-TNFAIP3 DNA was added to the well. At 4 hours after transfection, the transfection medium was removed and the Schneider’s Drosophila medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to each well. The cells were incubated for 48 hours at 25 ℃.
