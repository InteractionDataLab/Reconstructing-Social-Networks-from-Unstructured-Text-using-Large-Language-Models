Protocol for Transfection of Adherent Cells (24 Well Plates)
1. The day before transfection, inoculate 24-well plates with an appropriate number of cells in serum-containing    medium such that they will be 50 to 70% confluent the following day. For most cell lines, we recommend plating
2.5×105 cells in 0.5 ml of medium. Incubate the cells at 37℃ in 0％ incubator overnight.
2. Fifteen to sixty minutes prior to transfection, carefully aspirate the medium from the wells and add 250 µl of fresh  growth medium to each well.
3. For each well to be transfected, prepare 25 µl of serum-free medium containing 1 pj of siLentFect as a starting   point.
4. For each well to be transfected, prepare 25 µl of serum-free medium containing DNA .Use a final concentration of  10 nM as a starting point. For example, for a 24-well plate with 250 µl of growth medium per well, prepare 25 µl of  serum-free medium containing 120 nM of DNA. After mixing with the diluted siLentFect from step 3 and addition to  cells, the final concentration will be 10 nM. The optimal concentration of siRNA may vary from 5 to 20 nM     depending on the cell line used and the gene to be targeted.
5. Add the diluted DNA to the diluted siLentFect. Mix by tapping or pipetting.
Incubate 20 minutes at room temperature.
6. Add 50 µl of complexes directly to cells in serum-containing medium. Rock the plate back and forth to mix.
Incubate the cells at 37℃ in incubator.
7. Gene silencing can be monitored at the mRNA or protein levels from 4 to 72 hours after the transfection. If toxicity  is a problem, change the medium 4 hours post transfection.
