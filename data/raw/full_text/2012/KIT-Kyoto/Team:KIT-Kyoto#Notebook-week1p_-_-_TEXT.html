DESIGN NOTE
First
The first number 1 indicates experiments about UAS.
The first number 2 indicates experiments about GAL4.
Second number 1 indicates making two experiments at the same time when we carried out ligation.
Second number 2 indicates making three experiments at the same time when we carried out ligation.
The parts we are going to submit are these seven, pSB1C3-UAS, pSB1C3-UAS-LacZ, pSB1C3-UAS-EGFP, pSB1C3-UAS-TNFAIP3,pSB1C3-GAL4, pSB1C3-HS-GAL4, and pSB1C3-Act5c-GAL4.
