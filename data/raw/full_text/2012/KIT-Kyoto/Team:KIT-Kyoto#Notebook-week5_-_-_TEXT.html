DESIGN NOTE
September 4th
The female-virgin flies (yw) and male flies (yw) were collected for mating with the microinjected males and females.
September 5th
The female-virgin flies (yw) and male flies (yw) were collected and separately kept at 25℃ for mating with the microinjected males and females.
September 6th
The female-virgin flies (yw) and male flies (yw) were collected and separately kept at 25℃ for mating with the microinjected males and females.
September 7th
The eclosed male and virgin female flies from microinjected embryos were collected and kept at 25℃ for maturation.
September 8th
The adult male and virgin female flies from microinjected embryos were mated with yw virgin female flies and yw male flies, respectively. Mated flies were transferred to the new food vials in every three days to lay eggs as much as possible. The eclosed male and virgin female flies from microinjected embryos were again collected and kept at 25℃ for maturation. The female-virgin flies (yw) and male flies (yw) were collected and separately kept at 25℃.
September 9th
The eclosed male and virgin female flies from microinjected embryos were again collected and kept at 25℃ for maturation. In total 83 flies were eclosed from the microinjected embryos. The calculated viability for the microinjected flies was 12.0%. The female-virgin flies (yw) and male flies (yw) were again collected and separately kept at 25℃.
Drosophila S2 cells (2.5 X 105 cells per well) were plated on the 24 well plate and cultured in the Schneider’s Drosophila medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 25 ℃.
September 10th
The adult male and virgin female flies from microinjected embryos were mated with yw virgin female flies and yw male flies, respectively. Mated flies were transferred to the new food vials in every three days to lay eggs as much as possible.
