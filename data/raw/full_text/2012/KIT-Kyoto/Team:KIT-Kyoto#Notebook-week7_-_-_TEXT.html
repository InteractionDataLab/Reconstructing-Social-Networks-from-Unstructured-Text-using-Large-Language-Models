By red eye screening, we identified the strain 13 and strain 14 to be the successfully transformed lines. Photographs for the transformed red (orange) eye fly (strain 13) were taken.
Drosophila S2 cells (2.5 X 105 cells per well) were plated on the 24 well plate and cultured in the Schneider’s Drosophila medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 25 ℃.
September 20th
By red eye screening, we identified the strain 23 and strain 29 to be the successfully transformed lines.
