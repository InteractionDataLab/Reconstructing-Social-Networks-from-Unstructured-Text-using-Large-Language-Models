MEETING
PROTOCOL
DESIGN NOTE
August 20th
1. Isolation of DNA fragment from the gel Sample applied to the electrophoresis
Composition
a product of PCR attB TNFAIP3(8/1)
DNA sample
90μL
6×Dye
18μL
Total
108μL
Results
DNA was isolated from the agarose gel by QIA Quick Gel Extraction Kit, then the DNA was dissolved in 40 uL of TE.
August 21st
1. Measuring the concentration of the attB TNFAIP3 DNA fragment
The order of sample applied to the electrophoresis
1kbmarker3uL，1uL of 5 fold dilution of attB TNFAIP3, 1uL of 10 fold dilution of attB TNFAIP3 DNA fragment，2uL of 1kbmarker, 1uL of 15 fold dilution of attB TNFAIP3 DNA fragment, 1uL of 20 fold dilution of attB TNFAIP3 DNA fragment, 1kbmarker1uL,
Result
The concentration of the isolated attB TNFAIP3 DNA fragments was estimated to be 35ng/uL.

We added 2uL of BP Clonase Ⅱ enzyme mix to this solution and incubate it for 2 hour.
3. Transformation
We added 100uL of XL1-Blue to the BP reaction products to do transformation.
August 22nd
We isolated 6 colonies from a plate and incubated in 2.5mL of Kanamycin(＋) LB liquid culture medium for 16 hours.
August 23rd
1 Purification of the candidate pENTR-TNFAIP3 DNA
We purified the candidate pENTR-TNFAIP3 DNA fro six independent colonies cultured on August 22 using QIA prep Spin Miniprep
2 Characterization of the candidate pENTR-TNFAIP3 DNA
We conducted PCR on the following condition to confirm the pENTR-TNFAIP3 DNA using primer designed for attB

4. The LR reaction products were transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue100uL according to the protocol and spread on the LB ampicillin(+) plate and cultured for 16 hours at 37℃.
August 24th
Single colonies were isolated from a plate with the candidate pTFW-TNFAIP3 and pTGW-TNFAIP3 and cultured them in LB ampicillin(+) liquid medium for 16 hours at 37℃.
August 25th
1. Purification of the candidate pTFW-TNFAIP3 and pTGW-TNFAIP3 DNA
the candidate pTFW-TNFAIP3 and pTGW-TNFAIP3 were purified by QIA prep Spin Miniprep Kit.
2. Characterization of the candidate pTFW-TNFAIP3 and pTGW-TNFAIP3
We used the primer attB to confirm the candidate pTFW-TNFAIP3 and pTGW-TNFAIP3 for PCR reactions under conditions described below.

Results: Since the amplified DNAs with appropriate sizes were detected on the gel, pTFW-TNFAIP3 and pTGW-TNFAIP3 were appeared to be successfully constructed by the Gateway system ! At this point we renamed the pTFW-TNFAIP3 as pUAS-flag-TNFAIP3.
August 26th
The female-virgin flies (w; Δ2,3) and male flies (yw) were collected for microinjection. The collected flies were kept in the 25℃ incubator separately.
