2-1-7 Purification of pAct5C DNA and pGaTB DNA
pAct5C DNA and pGaTB DNA was purified from E. coli prepared on 8/29by QIA prep Spin Miniprep Kit.
September 1st
1-1-18 and 2-1-8   Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR produsts and the purified pAct5C DNA and pGaTB DNA
Agarose gel image is shown below. Left to right: HS promoter 10uL, UAS fragment 10uL, pAct5C DNA-1, pGaTB DNA-1, pGaTB DNA-2, pAct5C DNA
1-1-19 and 2-1-9  Expected bands for pAct5C DNA and pGaTB DNA were detected on the gel, but band for UAS fragment was not.
September 3rd
1-1-21 and 2-1-11  PCR amplification of DNA fragments containing GAL4, Act5C promoter and LacZ sequence
pGaTBDNA was used as a template to amplify GAL4 sequence. pAct5C-LacZ DNA was used to amplify Act5C promoter-enhancer region and LacZ.
