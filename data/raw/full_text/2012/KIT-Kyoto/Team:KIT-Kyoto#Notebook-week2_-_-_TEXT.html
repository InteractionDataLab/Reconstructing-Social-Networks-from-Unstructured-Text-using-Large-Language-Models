TNFAIP3
MEETING
PROTOCOL
DESIGN NOTE
August 8th
We isolated 5 colonies from the LB plate, and cultured.
August 9th
1. Purification of the candidate pUAS-flag-TNFAIP3 DNA
The candidate pUAS-flag-TNFAIP3 DNAs from five independent sample -1,-2,-3,-4 and -5 were purified by the alkaline-lysis method.
We added 0.2uL of 10ng/uL RNase A to them and incubate them for 1 hour.
2. Characterization of the candidate pUAS-flag-TNFAIP3 DNA
The candidate pUAS-flag-TNFAIP3 DNA was digested wit EcoRⅠ as follows.
Each diluted DNA sample

10×H buffer
0.5μL

After incubation of these samples for 1hour, we added 1uL of 6×Dye to each of them and electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gel in following order.
Left, 10fold dilution, 2uL marker, 20fold dilution, 30fold dilution, 1uL marker, 40fold dilution, 0.5uL marker right.
Result
The concerntration of the candidate pUAS-flag-TNFAIP3 DNA was estimated as 200ng/uL.
3. PCR amplification of the insert DNA
The four 5'primers were designed for PCR as follows.
・GW3r
5’-ATCGAGGCCTGTCTAGAGAAGC
・TNFA-1
5’-GGCTTTGCTATGATACTCGGAACTG
・TNFA-2
5’-GTAAAATGTGAAACGCCCAACTGC
・TNFA-3
5’-GGACTCCAGAAAACAAGGGCTTT
The 3’ primer was designed as follows.
・SVr
5’-GGCATTCCACCACTGCTCCC
PCR reactions with the following combinations of primers were carried out.
sample１→GW3r―SVr
sample２→TNFA-1―SVr
sample３→TNFA-2―SVr
sample４→TNFA-3―SVr
PCR was carried out in the following reactions.

August 10th
Electrophoresis of PCR products was carried out.
After adding 2uL of 6×Dye to each 10uL of sample, we electrophoresed them in 0.7% agarose gel in following order.

Result
The sizes of the PCR products were unexpected ones. We therefore concluded the construction of pUAS-flag-TNFAIP3 DNA was not successful.
August 13th
Cut check of the plasmid DNA(the candidate pENTR-TNFAIP3) after BP reaction.
The candidate pENTR-TNFAIP3 was digested with HindⅢ that will cut out the insert DNA.

Results
Insert size was different from the expected one. We therefore concluded that the construction of entry DNA was not successful.
August 14th
Based on the results, we decided to carry out the PCR reaction for TNFAIP3 DNA again.
