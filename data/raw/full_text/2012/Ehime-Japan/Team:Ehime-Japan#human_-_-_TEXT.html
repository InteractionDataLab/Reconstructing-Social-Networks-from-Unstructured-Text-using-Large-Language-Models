・E.create!
Our motivation
We made a BioBrick card game “E.create” to introduce to a number of people    the enjoyability of synthetic biology. Nobody in our team had learned synthetic biology until     we started our iGEM project. We thought from our experiences that the construction of the plasmids     is the most interesting process. We hope that everybody who is interested in life sciences and     genetic engineering can enjoy learning synthetic biology by playing with E.create!
E.create is a puzzle game. The kit contains cards with illustrations on them.      Each card corresponds to one of the gene parts including:
・Promoter,
・RBS (Ribosome Binding Site),
・Protein coding regions,
・Terminator,
・Ori (Origin), and
・Drug registance genes (KmR, CmR and AmpR).
☆ How to play
Players will challenge to constract one or more plasmid(s) that should be required to    transform ''E.coli'' to give properties presented by the puzzle master. An example is shown below.    Let’s make it!
Ex. This ''E.coli'' can express GFP constitutively and has Km resistance.
