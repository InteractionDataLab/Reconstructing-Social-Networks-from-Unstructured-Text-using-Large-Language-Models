・Questionnaire
Our survey was carried out by Ehime-Japan, Osaka and KIT-Kyoto iGEM 2012 teams together!  We obtained a lot of answers from people in different regions.
≪Questions about genetic recombination≫
Choose the best answers from the bottom.
Q1
In Europe, genetically modified foods are distributed on the market widely. When shopping, would you buy “not genetically modified foods” if there is an indication?
[Always buy / Tend to buy / Hardly mind / Not mind / Never seen such an indication]
Q2
Have you ever heard the word, “Synthetic biology”?
[Yes / No]
Q3
What do you associate with genetic engineering and biotechnology?
[Clone / GM crops(foods) / DNA / Genome / Medicine / Cosmetic / Bioethics / Virus / Artificial life/Biological weapon / iPS cells / ES cells / Biofuel / Gene therapy / Others]
Q4
What do you think about genetic engineering?
[Unfamiliar technology / Negative effects on the environment / Negative effects on the human body / Unethical conduct / Insufficient legal framework / Don’t like science / Unclear / Need to prove safety /  No negative effects on the environment or people / Effective / Useful / Interesting / Not care / Others]

Summary
Q1
More than half of 10’s and 20’s answered “Always buy” or “Tend to buy”, and more than 70% of 30's and over answered “Always buy” or “Tend to buy”. In 10s, there is also the person who does not know the indication. On the other hand, the generation of having children is especially sensitive to the safety of foods, tends to feel uneasy about negative effects on the human body.
Q2
More than 70% people haven’t ever heard the word, “synthetic biology”. The word, “synthetic biology” hasn't spread yet. We need to extend the knowledge of synthetic biology and genetic transformation.
Q3
GM crops, clone, DNA, iPS cells are ranked higher than other thing.
It’s remarkable that the number of 10’s which answered “Bioethics” is the fewest among all generations.
Q4
All the generations are worrying about negative effects on the human body and the environment.
We think that public attention became stricter to technology because of the accident of Fukushima nuclear power plant.
There is also the person who wants to know about genetic transformation.
