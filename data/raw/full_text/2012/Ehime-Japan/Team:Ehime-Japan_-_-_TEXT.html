Ehime-Japan team challenged to three projects, which would finally lead us to create “E.colingual”, a tool through which we can know E. coli feelings. It consists of three parts: Main, Connection, and Screen.
To realize our project, we used the light sensor genes from Synechocystis, the Lon protease and the ssrA tag from Mesoplasma florum. Also, a cell-cell signaling system and the heat shock and cold shock promoters were used so as to construct a foundational system of E.colingual.
“E.co-mail” is a communication tool with E. coli and an optical fiber. We would be able to transfer digital information depicted in E.coli through a distance, and probably could send e-mails with this tool.

We tried to reconstruct toppling dominoes with E. coli,       and we would be able to draw a movie of firework on LB plate!

Main is comprised of two different kinds of E. coli transformants.       One is that feels heat and cold and respond differently, producing different      signaling molecules. The other catches the signaling molecules and convert       the signal into the form of light. As a result, we can see a temperature change      around the E. coli. The light signals could be transferred through a distance       and be displayed if the Connection and Screen systems work.

It consists of three parts:Main, Connection, and Screen. E.colingual is a tool through which       we can know E. coli feelings:“hot”,“cold”, “happy” ,or “dying” etc…       Also, by an optical fiber, the information of those feelings is transmitted       to someone in a distant place from a lab. Actually, we focused on E. coli feelings, “hot” and “cold”.

→  New degradation system
We used two different ssrA tags to make a circulatable communication system. One is from M. florum recognized by the Lon protease from M. florum. The other is E. coli ssrA tag (LVA).     Because the sequences of those tags are not similar, the degradation systems should function     independently.

We made new BioBrick parts!

→ Human Practice
Ehime-Japan did a lot of projects as Human Practice!
・Ecreate !
We are enjoying gene recombination, and to tell interests of synthetic biology for     high school students, we made “E.create”!! It is a card game that people can enjoy      building genetic circuits. Also, we did educational activities for high school students      and played them with E.create!

・Questionnaire
Our survey was carried out by Ehime-Japan, Osaka and KIT-Kyoto iGEM 2012 teams together!      Thus, we were able to obtain a lot of replies, and found more general opinions      about synthetic biology in Japan.
