Ehime-Japan2012 team is constructed from seven sophomore students and two instructors. The ideas, which are “E.colingual” (Miho), “E.co-domino” (Miwa) and “E.co-mail” (Miho and Miwa) were all proposed by student members. The experiments and human practice were carried out by all the members. Our wiki was designed and made by Mei and Miho. Modeling related to the degradation with Lon-tag was done by Shunsuke. Nice pictures were taken by Hikaru. Dr. Takai and Dr. Hori gave us some advices to our activities.
Contribution
The Ehime-Japan iGEM activities were in part supported by the "Project-E" student research support program by Ehime University.
We obtained the plasmids, pJT122, pJT118, pJT106b and pCph8 through addgene. We also got the  E.coli, JW0429 which is Δlon strain from Keio Collection via National BioResource Project E. coli (NBRP E.coli) of Japan.
