Context and Objectives
Every year industries spend billions of dollars to get rid of the biofilms which develop in their installations. Indeed biofims are reponsible for :
Food spoilage or poisoning in the food industry
Pathogens' persistence and dispersal in health industry
Corrosion and diameter reduction of pipelines
At the moment, industries have some solutions at their disposal to limit the biofilm development but they have generaly an environmental impact and/or an important cost.
Thus, we develop a new generation of solution against biofilms in industry, which allows to reduce :
The use of harmful chemical reagents in cleaning processes
The cleaning costs for industrialists

PROJECT STRATEGY
Our solution is based on engineered bacterial "torpedos" capable of infiltrating, destroying biofilms (KILL) and protecting the cleaned surfaces by either a surfactant coating (COAT option), or by establishment of a positive biofilm ( STICK option).
This tunneling activity of Bacillus subtilis swimmer cells enables to :
Facilitate the delivery of the active substances within the biofilm.
Destroy the inacessible biofilms in pipes.
Moreover Bacillus strains are non pathogenic and do not cause equipment deteroriation by corrosion.
To sum up, this biocide-alternative strategy provides a money-saving and an environementally friendly solution for the control of unwanted biofilm.
