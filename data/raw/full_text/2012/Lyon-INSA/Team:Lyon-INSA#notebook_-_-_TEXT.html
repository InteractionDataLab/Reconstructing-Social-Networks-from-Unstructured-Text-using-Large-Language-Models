Result of the transformation of NM522 by pHT304 S and pHT315 S : 0 clone and 1 clone... this only clone is tested but the test is negative : the SpeI site is always here at 311 bp. The cultures of the transformation are concentrated and spread on LB plate : 0 clone for pHT304 S and 18 for pHT315 S but none of the clones is good. We must do the filling-in again...

For all purposes
Extraction of NM522/pHT315S. We expected a plasmid without a SpeI site. However, the selected clone contained a plasmid identical to pHT315 (the digestion by SpeI and EcoRI enzymes gives a fragment at 1000 bp). We decided to screen more clones (8 out of 17).
The transformation pSB1C3 + RFP and pSB1T3 + RFP is a success ! (red clones)

New Lysostaphin tests are planned (on plates) : in this purpose, a culture of 60 mL of Bs 168 pWG100 is inoculated and then incubated overnight at 28°C.
None of the clones Lysostaphin+Dispersin grew in LB + Amp so LB cultures were inoculated.
Out of 29 clones, 18 Promoter+Dispersin clones are Ampicillin sensitive, LB cultures are launched with these clones.

Culture of 60 mL of Bs 168 pWG 100 at 28°C for the lysostaphin tests on plates.
Monday, August 13th 2012
For all purposes
We identified the reason why the deletion of the site SpeI from pHT315 and pHT304 plasmids and filling-in was not successful : the Pfu enzyme requires Mg2+ and the buffer we used did not contain any, so we decided to give it another try, this time with the proper buffer.
The extracted plasmids containing the RFP gene in the pSB1C3 backbone were digested and verified by electrophoresis.
Kill
Lysostaphin tests : Flasks of 25mL of Bs 168 pWG 100 filtered supernatant were cultivated on Friday and frozen at -20°C on Sunday (2 flasks of each). The control flask is filled with 25mL of LB broth.  These flasks are then frozen at -80°C and freeze-dried overnight.
The gel electrophoresis of the digested plasmid [Lysostaphin + Dispersin] in pSB1C3 doesn’t correspond to the expected fragments. Similarly, the second electrophoresis shows that the clones with [Constitutive promoter + Dispersin] in pSB1C3 do not have the right plasmid : the digested fragments do not have  the right size.

Miniprep of the clones having integrated the modified  shuttle vector (after filling-in). 4 clones seem to have the right plasmid.
The electrophoresis after digestion with EcoRI and SpeI showed that the SpeI site was eliminated. 4 clones were chosen for further tests. However, the DNA concentration was too low so the enzymes did not digest the plasmids.
Kill
Ligation of the Constitutive promoter (Pveg) produced by PCR in an iGEM plasmid.
Result of the lysostaphin tests : didn’t work again. The Bs 168 pWG100 supernatant doesn’t contain any lysostaphin : the lysostaphin is probably degraded in one way or another (sensitivity to defrosting ?).

The plasmids (pBK19 and pBK20) from 2 clones were re-extracted using columns. This time, the digestion was successful. The tests showed that there was no SpeI site. However, the pHT315 plasmid also had no XbaI site. We digested the two plasmids with the XbaI enzyme and this time we incubated the digestion during one hour, instead of 10 minutes. We also tested the enzyme on another plasmid which had a XbaI site. The digestion of the control plasmid was partial.

3A ligation of pBK4 (pUC57 containing the lacI gene) and pBK29 (pSB1A3 containing the sfp and abrB genes) in pBK24 (pSB1C3 containing a RFP gene). The cloned fragment was transformed in the NM522 strain.
Stick
After the bad results with xylR, we decided to cut pBK10 plasmid in SmaI site, and ligate with xylR, doing a blunt ligation. We also decided to ligate xylR with xylR, creating a big polymer, which will be like a “pre-ligation” molecule.
Extraction of pBK24-xylR from 7 clones. Gel electrophoresis is run → ONE CLONE IS GOOD!! Meaning that it’s the first time we manage to ligate xylR successfully.
Physiological tests
The microtiter plate prepared the day before is analyzed. There is a significant difference between the adherence potential of the two strains. B. subtilis abrB strain forms thin layer biofilms while B. subtilis 168 doesn't form any specific kind of biofilms.

Midiprep : Extraction of Pveg-dispersin-pSB1C3 of clone 22.
BK33 strain was put in storage.
Surfactant
Given the fact that the digested plasmids extracted from transformed NM522 E. coli with the 3A ligation (pBK24, pBK4, pBK29) had unexpected fragments (and impossible to explain), the ligation was done again, this time changing the vector/insert ratio (1/1 and 1/3, as opposed to the first trial with a ⅙ ratio ).
Liquid cultures of two potentially good clones of the NM522 strain transformed with a 3A ligation (pBK22(promoter Pxyl, RBS and sfp gene), abrB gene and pSB1A3 backbone) were made for miniprep (the two plasmids were extracted using the classic ABC protocol, with extraction solutions that we made, so the yield and the purity of the extractions were poor; that’s why we decided to extract the plasmids again, this time using an extraction kit).
Stick
No transformation was done, because we ran out of LB broth.

Ligation of [Constitutive promoter + Dispersin] in the shuttle vector pBK25.
Results of the transformation of BS 168 strain with the pBK28 (1) in the shuttle vector : the negative control is full of bacteria → Is the Bs 168 strain resistant to erythromycin ? Or is the erythromycin concentration too low ?
We made another transformation and we spread the transformed bacteria on LB+Ery plates with different erythromycin concentration (from 5 µg/mL to 10 µg/mL).
Surfactant

Transformation of the previous ligation [promoter-dispersin-pBK25] in E. coli NM522.
Results of the second transformation of Bs 168 strain with pBK28 (1) in the shuttle vector : the negative control is still full of bacteria even though the erythromycin concentration was higher than the previous trial (0,5 µg/mL the first time, 5 and 10 µg/mL the second time).
We made (LB+Ery) plates with different erythromycin concentrations in order to make different tests.
Surfactant
Only one of the 24 screened colonies concerning the two ligations (3A ligation of pBK24, pBK4, pBK29, with two different insert/vector ratios) did not turn up to be red (LB+Cm plate) and did not grow on a LB+Amp plate. The clone was used to inoculate a liquid culture for an extraction.
Miniprep of the two clones containing the sfp and abrB genes. The gel electrophoresis did not turn out as expected, probably because the bacteria used for inoculating the liquid cultures were contaminated or did not come from the same colony. We decided to transform the low purity plasmids into the NM522 strain.
Given the fact that we were not very optimistic concerning the 3A ligation of pBK24, pBK4 and pBK29, we decided to do two more trials, this time using  two ligated genes (sfp and abrB) coming from clones other than the one containing pBK22. However, the miniprep of the bacteria which were supposed to contain the two plasmids was unsatisfying, so we decided to do the 3A ligation with the low purity plasmids, isolated with the classic protocol because we were running out of time and we were behind the schedule.
In parallel, we decided to do a standard ligation in order to transfer the lacI gene into a plasmid having an antibiotic resistance other than Ampicillin. This way, in case the 3A ligations fails, we would not be forced to do again a 3A ligation because the plasmids would have different antibiotic resistances.
Stick
Transformation of xylR-pBK24 in NM522. The transformation of xylR-pBK24 is done in order to see if xylR was successfully ligated or not. If the bacteria are red, then xylR was not ligated.

All 5 transformations were successful. White colonies are selected (pBK24 is a plasmid containing RFP in the pSB1C3 backbone, so we can exclude the colonies having integrated the religated backbone) and tested on LB+Cm and LB+Amp plates.
The miniprep of the one clone that had the expected phenotype (obtained after the transformation of the 3A ligation of pBK24, pBK4, pBK29) was digested, but the gel electrophoresis did not turn out as expected.
The miniprep confirmed that the ligation containing lacI was successful.
Stick
The patched plate is used as a master for replica-printing. The replica plate contains LB+Kan growth medium. Results : only one clone didn’t grow in the replica plate, meaning that it might be a clone containing xylR-pBK10 ligation. The clone is put in liquid culture overnight.
Another test is run to confirm that pBK34 plasmid (xylR-pBK24) doesn’t contain xylR : we digested the plasmid using NdeI restriction enzyme. Since xylR contains a NdeI restriction site (pBK24 doesn’t contain it), if pBK34 is opened by the enzyme, it means that it contains xylR. Result : pBK34 doesn’t contain xylem.
Friday, August 31st 2012
For all purposes
We have finally received the enzymes, so we tested the minipreps containing the modified shuttle vectors (containing the iGEM linker). The results are promising : 4 plasmids are digested by SpeI, so the ligation was successful. The four plasmids are further tested for the other 3 iGEM sites. To make sure that the site SpeI is not the initial site that we eliminated by filling-in and that the plasmid used for transformation and ligation was not contaminated with the original plasmid, a double digestion was done (EcoRI and SpeI). There was no fragment at 1,000 bp, so the ligation was successful.

Verification of midiprep : Midiprep of Lysostaphin in pSB1C3 is okay but not the one of Dispersin in pUC57.
Miniprep of 14 clones NM522 transformed with Lysostaphin in pBK26. The digestions and electrophoresis show that 7 clones are ok ! They are put in storage under the references pBK38 (1) to pBK38 (6).
Extraction of 14 clones transformed with Dispersin in pBK25. Gel electrophoresis showed no good clones.
Surfactant
One of the 12 screened clones transformed with the ligation of pBK22 and pBK39 has the expected fragments. Unfortunately, the plasmid is mixed with another one. To separate the two plasmids we decided to transform 1 µL of the miniprep into E. coli NM522 strain.
6 other clones with the transformed 3A ligation (done on August 29th) are screened.
Standard ligation of the abrB gene and the plasmid containing lacI in pSB1C3 backbone (pBK37) and transformation. In parallel, another ligation is attempted : [pBK37 + pBK29].

Shuttle vector containing lysostaphin is treated with an alkaline phosphatase, then a ligation with dispersin is realized,  followed by transformation in E. coli NM522 strain.
Dispersin is ligated with pBK26 and then digested by BamHI before transformation. BamHI digestion allows not to transform the circularized vectors which doesn’t contain the insert.
Surfactant
Plasmids from the 6 clones containing the 3A ligation are extracted and digested. Gel electrophoresis showed that one of the clones has the expected fragments. However, it was mixed with another plasmid. In order to separate them, we decided to transform the NM522 strain with 1µL of the miniprep.

Tests are launched to verify manufacturer cells. And other tests are launched to verify that our plates contained the appropriate antibiotic.
A transformation is made with our cells of their positive control.
Transformations of Bs 168 :

Lots of clones are obtained with our cells.So we have tried a transformation of commercial cells with bigger quantities of DNA.
Miniprep of clones obtained with STLB2 are made. Clones are not okay. A new transformation with the same ligation mix is made but with NM522.
Results of the transformations of Bs 168 : not coherent. However, the problem seems to be identified : it is the erythromycin solution. Indeed, the erythromycin must be diluted in ethanol and not in water and must be kept refrigerated at -20°C.
Standard ligations between :

Gel electrophoresis showed that 5 out of 6 clones screened after the transformation with the miniprep containing two plasmids had the expected fragments. However, we had doubts and we decided to search for restriction sites in the sequences that the plasmid was supposed to contain to make sure we had the right construction. We found out that a digestion with EcoRV would give 5 fragments of different sizes, enough to confirm the presence of the expected genes. Unfortunately, the electrophoresis was disappointing.

For all purposes
Ampicillin resistance tests gave some surprising results : even at 1.3 mg/mL there is bacterial growth. However, the higher Ampicillin concentration is, the lower OD600 of the liquid cultures is. Ampicillin resistance test of the two shuttle vectors did not show any significant difference between the two strains (BK37 and BK38). The result is not surprising, given the fact that both plasmids (pBK36 and pBK35) derive from the shuttle vectors pHT315 and pHT304 which have the same origin replication as pUC19. However, the test must be done again, this time with at least two samples for each Ampicillin concentration in order to be able to estimate an error.
Kill
Clones obtained on lysostaphin-dispersin plates are put in liquid culture.
Transformation of Bs 168 : new trial ! To improve our protocol, we took periodic OD600600 measurements in order to stop the cell growth at the best stage (just between the exponential and the stationary phase). The Bs 168 strain is transformed by :
pBK 25 (= modified shuttle vector pHT304);
pBK 26 (= modified shuttle vector pHT315);
pBK 28 (= Lysostaphin in the  modified shuttle vector pHT304);
pBK 38 (= Lysostaphin in the modified shuttle vector pHT315);
Dispersin in pBK26.

A miniprep of potential lysostaphin-dispersin clones is made : no clones are okay.
Result of the transformation of Bs 168 :
All the negative control plates are clear : the erythromycin concentration is high enough to do a selection;
Some plates with the transformed bacteria are empty but some have from 1 to 4 clones : these clones are put in liquid cultures in order to extract and analyze their DNA;
Transformation of Bs 168 : new trial by electroporation. As the last transformation, the Bs 168 strain is transformed by pBK25, pBK26, pBK28, pBK38 and dispersin in pBK26.
A new SDS-PAGE is made using supernatants and pellets as samples. The samples were not concentrated enough, so the gels didn’t show any of the expected bands.

All the screened clones had the religated vector, so we decided to use commercial competent cells from STLB2 strain to transform the ligation of pBK39 and pBK22 in order to diminish the number of clones so that the chances of finding the recombinant plasmid containing the 3 genes (sfp, abrB and lacI) would be higher.

Miniprep of the clones Bs 168 transformed by pBK25, pBK26, pBK28, and Dispersin in pBK26. Electrophoresis to analyze extracted DNA :
Bs 168 clone transformed by pBK25 has the right plasmid !! =)
Bs 168 clone transformed by pBK28 has the right plasmid !! BACILLUS LYSOSTAPHIN IS HERE !! :D :D :D
Bs 168 clones transformed by pBK26 and dispersin in pBK26 : nothing on the gel...
Transformation of Bs 168 GFP with the five same plasmids as before. The transformed bacteria are spread on LB + Ery plates, with two different concentrations : [Ery]=10 µg/mL and [Ery]=15 µg/mL.
Given the fact that there was nothing on the miniprep for pBK26 and pBK28, we made a new electrophoresis after using the seeDNA method  to concentrate the DNA of the miniprep. We see very light stripes on the gel, but the results for pBK26 and dispersin in pBK26 have to be confirm again...
Thanks to the good results, we put in storage the transformed Bacillus under the reference :
BK41 : Bs 168 + pBK25
BK42 : Bs 168 + pBK28
BK43 : Bs 168 + pBK26 (to confirm)
BK44 : Bs 168 + Dispersin in pBK26 (to confirm)

For all purposes
4 transformations with the same amount of plasmid are done (pBK19,pBK20, pBK35 and pBK36) in order to characterize the transformation efficiency of the shuttle vectors.
Ampicillin resistance test was repeated, this time with 3 tubes per Ampicillin concentration for each plasmid.

We decided to give another try and do the ligation once again, this time using 5 time less vector and a ⅛ ratio vector/insert. Given the fact that we are running out of time, we did two ligations hoping to construct the same biobrick: pBK22+pBK39 and pBK29+pBK37. Both ligations were transformed into the E. coli NM522 strain.

OD600 test in tanks to test lysostaphin effect on a S. epidermidis culture. Strains used for the test are E. coli strains which might produce lysostaphin. Supernatant is filtered and applied on the S. epidermidis culture.
S. epidermidis cultures are launched with tetracycline or without tetracycline. Presence or absence of antibiotic doesn’t change test results. The only effect is that cultures grow more slowly with antibiotic.
According to the results there is an effect of lysostaphin but we observed an effect due to the initial OD600 of cultures that were different, so we don’t know if the results can be used. A new protocol is tried out, culture are diluted to have the same OD600.
New SDS-PAGE 12% gel is done with just the supernatants. The samples preparation didn’t go well and they were not enough concentrated. Therefore the gel didn’t show anything.
Plac and Pxyl kinetics
Measurement of the NM522 + Plac kinetics (with Cm) during 12h in a 96 well plate with and without different IPTG concentration addition. (1 mM; 0.5mM and 0.1mM)
In the same 96 well plate NM522 + Pxyl kinetics is also measured during 12h with and without different xylose concentration. (2%; 0.5% and 0.2%)
Results : kinetics decreases so there is a problem. But it can be explained by the fact that the promoters need to be activated by a sigma factor which is active in the exponential phase and 12h is not enough. So this experiment has to be done during 24h.
Physiological tests
The microtiter plates prepared the day before are analyzed. Each well is stained with crystal violet and subsequently OD600 is measured in order to quantify the adherence of the strain. We can see that the biofilm is not adherent enough and it is destroyed no matter what kind of supernatant is tested. Unfortunately, we cannot say what the effect of the dispersin or lysostaphin is using this kind of test.
