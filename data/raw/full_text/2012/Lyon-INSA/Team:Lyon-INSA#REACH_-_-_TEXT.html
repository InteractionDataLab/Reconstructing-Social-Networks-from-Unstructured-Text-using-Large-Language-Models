Microbial control processes currently relies mainly on the use of high quantity of chemicals. Since the introduction of the REACH Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) regulation in 2007, which “makes industry responsible for assessing and managing the risks posed by chemicals and providing appropriate safety information to their users” ( Website of European commission ), use of chemicals has to be limited and solutions for sustainable microbial control have to be invented.
