Team:Lyon-INSA/collaboration
From 2012.igem.org
How did we collaborate?
Collaboration is a very important issue. We think that sharing our ideas could be very beneficial for both teams engaged in the collaboration. There are more than 240 teams involved in the iGEM 2012 so it was impossible not to find another team sharing some aspects of our project.
iGEM FRANCE
iGEM FRANCE is a network gathering the French iGEM community together, linked by a collaborative website. Everything started in February 2012 in Lyon, by the meeting "The iGEM French Touch", organized by the Lyon-INSA iGEM team to help new French iGEMers to improve their scientific, human and financial organization. The ambition of iGEM France is to promote and develop in France SynBio research and development, SynBio teaching, biosafety and  bioethics, dialogue between science and society, and develop SynBio programmation by Governmental agencies.
Collaboration with the University of British Columbia (UBC)
We have established a collaboration with UBC for our Human Practice. Indeed, UBC was working on Intellectual property (IP) this year, an aspect we also chose to explore.
One of our advisors is a Professor in Economics. Thus, we have suggested to UBC when they sent their survey on IP, that we could share with them our knowledge and thoughts to improve their survey or to interpret the results of their survey. In exchange they shared the results of their survey with us.
We have used their results to show what kind of IP issues iGEM teams could meet. To see the results of our collaboration you might want to read our Human Practice page .
An interesting way to undertake a collaboration with Göttingen team
Furthermore, we have tried to begin a collaboration with the Göttingen team . They are working on a super swimming E. coli strain. We have proposed them different ways for collaboration. For example, we were interested in comparing the impact of swimming on biofilm destabilization between their E. coli strain and our Bacillus subtilis natural swimming strain. We offered to send them our Bacillus subtilis strain to also make them able to perform comparative swimming behavior studies between both strains. Several different reasons made this collaboration unsuccessful.
Collaboration with TU Munich
We took part in TU Munich 's survey about their proposition of standardization of BioBricks part descriptions.
