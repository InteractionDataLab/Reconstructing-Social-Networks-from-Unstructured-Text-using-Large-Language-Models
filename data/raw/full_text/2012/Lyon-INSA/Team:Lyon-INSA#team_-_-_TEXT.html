iGEM rocks so badly, when you do it once, you just wanna do it again :)
But this year, I'm keeping a low profile, just helping out the newbies to settle in and feel comfy in the lab. I'm still enjoying working around bacteria, apart from B. subtilis producing lysostaphin, because it smells so badly you just wanna die when you happen to be working in the same room!
I also like playing volleyball, cooking, baking, eating and above all traveling and meeting new people ^^ See y'all at the Jamboree!
Bastien Doix
I am a third-year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA Lyon and taking part in iGEM for the first time. I am joining the iGEM team to have a first sight of what genetics and bacterial manipulation is and to step into something different from studies. I like sports, skiing and computer graphics and hope to make it to Boston.
Alexandre Duprey
This year, I’m back for another iGEM competition. I’m still at INSA Lyon, fourth-year biochemistry and biotechnology, and still interested in how we can regulate parts to make them work together. However this time I’m rather advising on the project with the intent to improve our weak points (who said modelling ?), and making sure the newcomers don’t make (too many) mistakes. Otherwise I play video games. A lot. Too much...
Patricia Gifu
I am an undergraduate student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA de Lyon. This year, I participate for the first time in iGEM.  I am very confident that INSA Lyon team is going to win because the team members worked very hard on the project and they all are skillful. I am passionate by biosciences. Outside the school I like watching movies and traveling whenever I have time.
Carine Gimbert
Also known as Stoatix, it is my first participation in the INSA-Lyon team. In my previous studies, I worked on two projects about bioremediation and production of vanillin using biotechnology. So being part of the iGEM team is really important to continue learning how to manage bacteria and working in a student team. I am fond of dance, photography and art in general. I live in a town where the international short film festival takes place : Clermont-Ferrand and one of my favorite is “la révolution des crabes”
Clémence Gonthier
When you participate in iGEM once, you just want to take part in this great adventure again !
In my fourth year of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, I’m still enjoying microbiology, modifying bacteria and creating new plasmids! I’m this time on the advisor side... Helping the new team members searching for sponsors and guiding them for experiments in the lab.
In my free time, I like dancing, playing the piano and traveling !
Anne Haziza
I am a third-year student in Biochemistry and Biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. I am taking part in the iGEM competition for the first time. This project is a good way for me to improve my organization skills, ingenuity and dynamism which will be very useful for the future. Outside of school, I enjoy cooking, playing handball and mainly traveling whenever possible! So I believe on the talent of her team to discover Amsterdam and of course Boston!
Rémi Hocq
I am also known as Clumsix for often being … clumsy. Hell, I am the kind of guy who managed to cut my finger trying to open a bottle of beer and for the record, I was actually using a bottle-opener. My clumsiness is even contagious : Gaël and Yoann also cut their finger during the summer. Anyway, I am also a third-year bioengineering student who love music (especially hard rock !), good food (though I am skinny and absolutely don't know why) and traveling. I may be a bit of a nerd too as I am a videogames fanatic.
Audrey Masi
Also known as Squirrelix because I used to climb up on trees and hide in narrow cupboards to make jokes to my friends. I am a third-year bioengineer. I am joining the IGEM team after a first experience in molecular biology to improve my knowledge and discover the synthetic biology approach. Outside of iGEM, I am interested in rock dance, cooking, traveling, and above all that literature.
Alex Mizgier
Also known as Hairix, I am a third-year biochemist at INSA Lyon. I am from Chile, specifically from the northern limit of Western Patagonia.
I got into the iGEM project because I think that it’s an unique experience and an excellent opportunity to learn more about bacterial manipulation and synthetic biology.
Apart from microbiology, I like reading, playing rugby, bicycle touring, and everything that involves nature and outdoor activities. You will find in me a knight-errant.
Béryl Royer-Bertrand
This is my second participation in the iGEM competition with the INSA Lyon team. In fourth year in Bioinformatics and Modeling, I’m helping this year the team in the modelling part from Scotland, where I am in academic exchange.
Ioana Sandu
I am a third-year Biochemistry student. I decided to join the Lyon team because I believe that the iGEM competition is a challenging experience that will put myself to the test. Apart from synthetic biology, I like dancing, star-gazing and reading while listening to music (the older, the better).
Xavier Tholot
I am a third-year student in computer sciences at INSA Lyon.
I come from Clermont-Ferrand, the city where Michelin was created, which isn't far from Lyon.
I am fond of music (I play the guitar and the clarinet), and also of computers : this year, I joined the Lyon-INSA team to help them improving their wiki, and make it as great as possible. ).
Marion Traouan
I am an undergraduate student in biochemistry and biotechnologies at INSA Lyon. This is my first participation in an iGEM team. I consider this as an opportunity not only  to acquire specific qualifications very useful for the future, but also to participate in the construction of an attractive project from scratch.
Besides my interest in biosciences, I am into sports like basket-ball or volley-ball,  reading and cinema. I hope my "blondness" won't be an obstacle to the realization of this project.
Marion Wolfovski
Also known as Rasberrix Olympix, I have a bachelor's degree in Sciences and I am now studying Biochemistry and Biotechnologies. This is my first participation in the iGEM competition. I love new challenges and iGEM is an amazing opportunity to manage together my passion for biology and building a project : a scientific adventure. I love sports and making cookies for my lovely team !

I am the leader of the biofilm group at the INRA Micalis Institute. I have focused my research on microbial biofilms present in the food chain with special emphasis on their role in the persistence of pathogens. One of my main scientific line of interest is to identify the link between the 3D spatial organization of biofilms and the survival mechanisms of cells in face to the exposition of antimicrobials. Recently, my team reported that a tiny proportion of certain Bacillus species can tunnel through biofilms, creating pores that allow molecules to flow in. We are now evaluating the industrial benefit to pretreat target biofilms with swimming Bacilli cocktails to increase their efficacy and reduced their ecological impact.
Gaël Chambonnier
Hi everybody, here is Chambix!! I just graduated from the INSA Lyon in Biotechnologies but after two participations at the iGEM Competition, I couldn’t do anything but continue my studies with a master in bioinformatics. After two years working in the lab for the team, I came back this year trying to help out the new team, sharing my experiences. Actually, they didn’t really need my help. They’ve done a great job with Bacillix. And for sure you’ll have to deal with them in Amsterdam and Boston.
Fanny Springer
I've joined the INSA-Lyon team this year to see how we can change the world using genetically engineered material !
Philippe Thomas
This year, Asterix and his friends have travelled until Buenos Aires in Argentina... They meet some strange people living riding horses, drinking mate, eating very good meat and raising cows in the infinite pampa! I’m one of this gauchos! I‘m currently working in Buenos Aires for 18 months as an Engineer in biotechnology in Sanofi Pasteur. As it is not so easy to assist meeting and perform some experiments, the best for me was to be an advisor! I try to help out my Gallic friends when some extra work is needed and give my best as advisor, sharing my experiences of the iGEM competition with them! El hombre de la pampa can’t wait to see the Lyon Biosciences Team rockin’ Amsterdam and Boston with our very powerfull bacteria!

Agnès Rodrigue
Olivier Brette
Associate Professor in economics at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées (INSA) de Lyon
I teach the "economics of firm", "innovation economics", as well as the "economics of globalization" to engineering students.
I am affiliated with the CNRS Research Unit "Environment, City, Society" (EVS), where I pursue my research activities in theoretical and applied economics. From a theoretical viewpoint, my research work aims at developing the methodological, conceptual, as well as behavioral foundations of Institutional and Evolutionary Economics. I resort to this theoretical framework to deal with different kinds of issues in innovation economics and economic geography.
Valérie Desjardin
Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon
After a Master of Advanced Studies in Biochemistry and a PhD in Chemistry and Science and Techniques of waste, now I teach Chemistry classes and also a class dealing with radioactive waste management in the Energy Engineering and Environment department.
My research work at the Laboratory of Civil engineering and Environmental engineering (LGCIE) is currently aimed at the study of biophysicochemical interactions of pollutants in various compounds (soils, sediments, municipal solid waste) using molecular biology tools. I am very excited to take part in the iGEM 2012 project which leads to the development of a synergy, already launched, between the Biosciences department and Environmental sciences.
Corinne Dorel
My teaching activities in the Microbial Genetics mainly take place within the Biosciences department at INSA Lyon, but also at the Ecole Normale Supérieur de Lyon and at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1.
My research work is based on the understanding of genetic mechanisms involved in the formation of biofilms and the contamination of materials. Being the Communications officer for the Biosciences department, my participation in iGEM 2012 is part of a strategy to promote and share knowledge in the field of research in genetic engineering and more generally in Biological Sciences.
Yoann Louis
Young ;) ) Associate professor at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Lyon
Up to now my work is focused on the trace metal behavior in the environment and their interaction with dissolved organic matter in aquatic ecosystems.
Now my work at the LGCIE laboratory is mainly to study trace metals/ organic matter behavior in various waste and to give an expertise on their potential toxicity depending on the bio-physico-chemical conditions of the studied site. As a chemist, my interest in the iGEM project is to have a working approach angle allowing the improvements of our environment thanks to our complementarity.
Philippe Oger
Also known as Piezophilix because I work on high-pressure adaptation in microorganisms. My research is focussed on adaptation mechanisms in microbes from the deep-biosphere, and mainly in Archaea isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems. Our aim is to identify and quantify what genetic modifications make our favorite model, Pyrococcus yanaosii, require 500 times the atmospheric pressure for growth, when everybody else's favorite lab rat, E. coli, cannot even growth at the same hydrostatic pressure. My teaching activities at the University of Lyon deal with petroleum reservoir microbiology and the use of biosignatures for the study of past and present environments.
Agnès Rodrigue
As an associate professor I find that iGEM is an unique experience, a place to mix teaching and practice in a long term project relying on students’ motivation. My teaching interests are microbiology, molecular biology, protein engineering  and bioinformatics.
My research topic focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in  bacterial adaptation to a  metal-rich environment, from molecular interactions to population biology. Apart from the basic approaches, this subject offers also  the opportunity to develop biological tools for the bioremediation of spoiled environment or the in situ detection of toxic compounds for instance, developments which I’m interested in. My motivation for iGEM is the same: conception and application.
