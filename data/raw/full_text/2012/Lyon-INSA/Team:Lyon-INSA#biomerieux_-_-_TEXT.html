Special thanks
Since the beginning of our adventure in the iGEM competition in 2010, Biomérieux has been our main sponsor. The start of Biomérieux success was in 1897, with the creation of the Mérieux Institute by Mr Mérieux. Nowadays, Biomérieux is established in each continent and in more than 160 countries and has more than 1000 collaborators. Biomérieux is a world actor in the field of:
In vitro     diagnosis for more than 45 years and offers solutions of diagnosis:     reagents to conduct biological tests to be able to identify     different types of bacteria, viruses and to measure markers or specific     hormones; instruments for automated testing and software to interpret the results of biological tests.
Clinical application for the diagnosis of infectious diseases such as     hepatitis, HIV, tuberculosis ans respiratory infections but also     cardiovascular diseases and cancer based on biological samples     analysis like blood, saliva, urine…. Clinical diagnoses use     reagents and instruments developed by the in vitro diagnostic     industry. Those tests are used to establish or confirm a diagnosis     or to determine an appropriate treatment and monitor its efficiency,
Industrial application for the analysis of industrial samples such as food,     pharmaceutical and cosmetic products or environmental samples such as     water, air surface to determine microbiological quality. The     industrial microbiology laboratory is very useful to test the     sterility of a product or the absence of pathogenic bacteria.     Biomérieux technology is able to detect Listerial in food product     during the production chain.
We want to thank Biomérieux for their support during the iGEM competition.
