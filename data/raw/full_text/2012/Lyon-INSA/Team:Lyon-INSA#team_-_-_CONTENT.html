I’m still at INSA Lyon, fourth-year biochemistry and biotechnology, and still interested in how we can regulate parts to make them work together. However this time I’m rather advising on the project with the intent to improve our weak points (who said modelling ?), and making sure the newcomers don’t make (too many) mistakes.  Otherwise I play video games. A lot. Too much...</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="presentation presStud"><DIV class="nomPres">

      </DIV><DIV class="textePres"><P>I am an undergraduate student in Biochemistry and Biotechnology at INSA de Lyon. This year, I participate for the first time in iGEM.  I am very confident that INSA Lyon team is going to win because the team members worked very hard on the project and they all are skillful. I am passionate by biosciences. Outside the school I like watching movies and traveling whenever I have time.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="presentation presStud"><DIV class="nomPres">
Carine Gimbert
      </DIV><DIV class="textePres"><P>Also known as Stoatix, it is my first participation in the INSA-Lyon team. In my previous studies, I worked on two projects about bioremediation and production of vanillin using biotechnology. So being part of the iGEM team is really important to continue learning how to manage bacteria and working in a student team. I am fond of dance, photography and art in general. I live in a town where the international short film festival takes place : Clermont-Ferrand and one of my favorite is <A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdLehwjV4pc">“la révolution des crabes”</A></P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="presentation presStud"><DIV class="nomPres">

This project is a good way for me to improve my organization skills, ingenuity and dynamism which will be very useful for the future. Outside of school, I enjoy cooking, playing handball and mainly traveling whenever possible! So I believe on the talent of her team to discover Amsterdam and of course Boston! </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="presentation presStud"><DIV class="nomPres">
Rémi Hocq
      </DIV><DIV class="textePres"><P>I am also known as Clumsix for often being … clumsy. Hell, I am the kind of guy who managed to cut my finger trying to open a bottle of beer and for the record, I was actually using a bottle-opener. My clumsiness is even contagious : Gaël and Yoann also cut their finger during the summer.

Anyway, I am also a third-year bioengineering student who love music (especially hard rock !), good food (though I am skinny and absolutely don't know why) and traveling. I may be a bit of a nerd too as I am a videogames fanatic.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="presentation presStud"><DIV class="nomPres">

I am a third-year bioengineer.
I am joining the IGEM team after a first experience in molecular biology to improve my knowledge and discover the synthetic biology approach.
Outside of iGEM, I am interested in rock dance, cooking, traveling, and above all that literature.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="presentation presStud"><DIV class="nomPres">

I got into the iGEM project because I think that it’s an unique experience and an excellent opportunity to learn more about bacterial manipulation and synthetic biology.
Apart from microbiology, I like reading, playing rugby, bicycle touring, and everything that involves nature and outdoor activities. You will find in me a knight-errant.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="presentation presStud"><DIV class="nomPres">

I consider this as an opportunity not only  to acquire specific qualifications very useful for the future, but also to participate in the construction of an attractive project from scratch.
Besides my interest in biosciences, I am into sports like basket-ball or volley-ball,  reading and cinema. I hope my &quot;blondness&quot; won't be an obstacle to the realization of this project.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="presentation presStud"><DIV class="nomPres">

I have focused my research on microbial biofilms present in the food chain with special emphasis on their role in the persistence of pathogens. One of my main scientific line of interest is to identify the link between the 3D spatial organization of biofilms and the survival mechanisms of cells in face to the exposition of antimicrobials. Recently, my team reported that a tiny proportion of certain <I>Bacillus</I> species can tunnel through biofilms, creating pores that allow molecules to flow in.

Hi everybody, here is Chambix!! I just graduated from the INSA Lyon in Biotechnologies but after two participations at the iGEM Competition, I couldn’t do anything but continue my studies with a master in bioinformatics.
After two years working in the lab for the team, I came back this year trying to help out the new team, sharing my experiences. Actually, they didn’t really need my help. They’ve done a great job with Bacillix. And for sure you’ll have to deal with them in Amsterdam and Boston.

They meet some strange people living riding horses, drinking mate, eating very good meat and raising cows in the infinite pampa! I’m one of this gauchos! I‘m currently working in Buenos Aires for 18 months as an Engineer in biotechnology in Sanofi Pasteur. As it is not so easy to assist meeting and perform some experiments, the best for me was to be an advisor!
I try to help out my Gallic friends when some extra work is needed and give my best as advisor, sharing my experiences of the iGEM competition with them! El hombre de la pampa can’t wait to see the Lyon Biosciences Team rockin’ Amsterdam and Boston with our very powerfull bacteria! </P></DIV></DIV></DIV><H2>Instructors</H2><DIV class="wrapper"><DIV id="instructorListing"><DIV class="instructorName">

My teaching interests are microbiology, molecular biology, protein engineering  and bioinformatics.  My research topic focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in  bacterial adaptation to a  metal-rich environment, from molecular interactions to population biology. Apart from the basic approaches, this subject offers also  the opportunity to develop biological tools for the bioremediation of spoiled environment or the in situ detection of toxic compounds for instance, developments which I’m interested in.
