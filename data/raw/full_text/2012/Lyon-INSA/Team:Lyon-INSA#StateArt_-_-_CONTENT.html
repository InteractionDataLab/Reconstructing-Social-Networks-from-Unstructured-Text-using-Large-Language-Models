Biofilm removal can be made using different ways, let us introduce you to these techniques.
<DIV><CENTER><B><BIG>Click on the title to show the text.</BIG></B></CENTER></DIV></DIV><H2>Mechanical and  Chemical actions</H2><DIV class="wrapper"><DIV class="contenuTexte" style="display:inline-block;"><P>Many strategies and chemical regimens have been defined for controlling biofilms. For open surface in food processing for example, biofilm removal is a multiple step process including <STRONG>pre-cleaning</STRONG> by scrapping and rinsing surfaces, <STRONG>washing</STRONG> (detergent), <STRONG>rinsing</STRONG> (to remove dirt and detergent solutions) and <STRONG>sanitizing</STRONG> (to  kill attached surviving bacteria and viruses). Closed surfaces such as pipes, tanks or filters require specific equipment such as  flooded clean-in-place systems.  Flooded systems involve filling all the pipes with successively water, chlorine, biocide, caustic or other chemicals. Other applications use continuous biocide injection procedures to prevent biofilm growth. 
</P><DIV class="introduction contenuTexte" style="display:inline-block;width:60%;"><P><STRONG>Mechanical action is often employed to remove biofilms</STRONG> : If only detergents or sanitizers are used to clean a food line or a pipe in which a biofilm is formed, chemicals contained in the detergent or in the cleaning product can be used to attack and destroy the matrix. But, when the chemical reaches the bacterial colony underlying the matrix, the product may lose its effectiveness in fighting the cells themselves. Scrapping or brushing will unstick the matrix and will expose the underlying bacteria to the action of detergents and sanitizers. Utility pigs allow operators to carry out pipe cleaning.

</DIV><P>Clean-In-Place (CIP) systems are automatic cleaning system integrated into the machine during its design. A major advantage is that it does not require any system disassembling to operate. The tanks and pipes are cleaned using a parallel fluid circuit. In automated machines, cycles and programs are integrated from the construction. With this system, it is possible to inject the cleaning solution to drain a pipe, but also to include an air- or water-pushed shuttle that scrapes the inner wall of the pipe. In this case, the shuttle is introduced by a parallel circuit or by an aperture in the main pipe. Implementation of an automated CIP system in an existing industrial plant leads to additional costs but is possible (see <A href="http://www.packo.com/en/"> Packo Inox NV </A>).
</P><DIV class="introduction contenuTexte" style="display:inline-block;width:75%;"><P>For small industries, more suitable methods have to be considered, such as the injection of water or solutions at high flow, which will cause the detachment of the biofilm due to shear forces. However, some fragments could contaminate the raw material that passes through the pipes like in the dairy farming. It is also possible to increase the temperature. A temperature increase will soften the biofilm but on the other hand, excessively hot temperatures can also lead to other problems such as milk proteins curdling on the milk line surface, thus facilitating the bacteria adhesion.
The products used are terminal types chlorination (chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, monochloramine, chlorine dioxide) for generating a residual biocide. The hydrogen peroxide is also used. Products can be both alkaline and acid coupled with disinfectants.

This alternative method to chemicals for destroying biofilms is based on enzymatic detergents which enables the elimination of biofilms. The Biorem solution contains, among other things, sequestering agents, dispersants, surfactants, stabilizers and enzymes <A href="http://www.realco.be/images/pdf/b2b/BIOREM-A1-BIOREM-10-FR.pdf">(BIOREM A1 + 10)</A>. Recommended for membrane filtration (ultra, micro and nano filtration) or the internal surfaces of CIP systems, this product is expected to eliminate biofilm and ensure optimum output stream, while guaranteeing perfect hygiene of surfaces. The cost of this solution is </P></DIV><P>around 500€/m<SUP>3</SUP> of solution in the case of a CIP use (telephone meeting with the R&amp;D department head of Realco), including the analysis to check the cleaning effectiveness. Realco presents its product as a biofilm destroyer but also as a preventive treatment. This solution is expected to have a lower impact on the environment, with limited release of detergent and total biodegradability, but requires to be used at 50°C to be effective (<A href="http://www.inra.fr/les_recherches/exemples_de_recherche/industries_agroalimentaires_des_enzymes_pour_un_nettoyage_a_fond">INRA website recommendation</A>). 

Another solution to avoid or limit chemicals use, is to prevent the colonization of pathogenic biofilms by spraying a positive bacterial biofilm on surfaces. For example, <A href="http://www.dietaxion.com/bases/produit/pdf1/13/FP_Cobiotex_112_V09_FR_2011-11-04.pdf">the Cobiotex® 112 product</A> , based on a bacterial strain of <I>Bacillus subtilis</I>, is used to limit the development of flora contamination in poultry breeding, and enables animals to evolve in a bio securised area. An other example is the use of <I>Bacillus</I> strains on tomato seeds which promotes a better growth of the crops.
