Data about our favorite new parts
1. Main Page : Dispersin generator for B. subtilis BBa_K802001 : This part associates the Bacillus subtilis constitutive promoter (Pveg) with the dispersin B gene (dspB). This part allows to efficiently scatter Staphylococci biofilms.
2. Main Page : Shuttle vector for E. coli and B. subtilis BBa_K802003 : This part is a shuttle vector of 6.5kb which is Ampicillin resistant in E. coli and Erythromycin resistant in B. subtilis. It is a low copy number plasmid in B. subtilis and a high copy number plasmid in E. coli. It has a polylinker containing all 4 of the iGEM restriction sites. This vector is characterized in B. subtilis by a transformation yield of 70 transformants/µg and a erythromycin resistance up to 900 µg/mL.
3. Main Page : Lysostaphin generator for B. subtilis BBa_K802000  : This part associates the Bacillus subtilis constitutive promoter (Pveg) with the lysostaphin gene. This part allows an efficient killing of S. aureus cells.
We've also characterized the following new parts
Main Page : Plac-RBS-GFP BBa_K802002 : This part has been designed to determine the behavior of the Plac promoter used to drive the STICK module (Part BBa_K802009)
Main Page : Shuttle vector for E. coli and B. subtilis BBa_K802004 : This part is a shuttle vector of 6.5kb which is Ampicillin resistant in E. coli and Erythromycin resistant in B. subtilis. It is a high copy number plasmid in both B. subtilis and E. coli. It has a polylinker containing all 4 of the iGEM restriction sites. This vector is characterized in B. subtilis by a transformation yield of 80 transformants/µg and a erythromycin resistance to at least 1,5 mg/mL.
Main Page : Surfactin generator and biofilm repressor for B. subtilis BBa_K802009: This part can be used to induce surfactin production and to repress the biofilm formation in B. subtilis strains (COAT module).
