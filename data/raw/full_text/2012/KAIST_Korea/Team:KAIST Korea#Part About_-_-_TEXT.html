How the Flip & Flop Works
Data for Our Favorite New Parts
Main Page - Bacteriophage Bxb1 gp35, DNA integrase(Bxb1_Int), BBa_K907000: A serine integrase family protein which recognizes specific DNA sequences and recombines dsDNA.
Main Page - Binary Signal Generator, RBS(reverse) - attB - Promoter - attP – RBS, BBa_K907002: Promotes transcription and translation of two different proteins one at a time when work with BBa_K907000 and BBa_K907001 to generate binary signal.
Main Page - Dual Phase Protein Generator (GFP default), BBa_K907004: Derivative of BBa_K907002 mRFP and GFP are attached to both ends of BBa_K907002 to generate binary signal via fluorescent proteins.
Data for Pre-existing Parts
Experience – Highly engineered mutant of red fluorescent protein from Discosoma striata (coral), BBa_E1010 (Endy Lab, 2004): BBa_E1010 was successfully used to produce mRFP in E.coli strain MG1655 in LB or M9 minimal media under the control of BBa_K907005.
Experience – Green fluorescent protein derived from jellyfish Aequeora victoria wild-type GFP (Endy Lab, 2004): BBa_E0040 was successfully used to produce GFP in E.coli strain MG1655 in LB or M9 minimal media under the control of BBa_K907004.
