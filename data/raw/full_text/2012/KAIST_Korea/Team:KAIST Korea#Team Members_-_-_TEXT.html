SONG, Yoseb Graduate Student yosebiback@kaist.ac.kr
I am a first year system and synthetic biology master/PhD candidate in KAIST, Byung-Kwan Cho’s lab. I am interested in application of system and synthetic biology to Engineer metabolic pathway. My works are focused on four areas:
Engineering bacterial RNA polymerase to engineer phenotypes
Adapting E. coli to live in severe conditions
Metabolic engineering
HAVE FUN!!!
I am helping 2012 KAIST iGEM Team with some experimental tips.

JEONG, Hyewon (Mandy) - TEAM LEADER - Undergraduate student jhw162@kaist.ac.kr
I am an undergraduate student in Systems and Synthetic biology lab and also a team leader of international competition, iGEM. KAIST 2012 iGEM team’s research topic is focused on these two topics.
Reconstruction of reductive anaerobic CO2 fixation pathway in Escherichia coli and modeling this system using program.
Building switching modules which can be used to control metabolic pathway.
JEON, Jihwan Undergraduate student casque09@kaist.ac.kr
I am a senior in the KAIST iGEM team. I study biology and especially fascinated by synthetic biology. Outside of the lab, I am a funny guy who loves to hang out and get drunk. However, what I love the most is sleeping. 
LEE, Soo-in Undergraduate student lee_sooin@kaist.ac.kr
I am an undergraduate student in KAIST. Now, I am planning to enter graduate school of the same institute. I’m interested in synthetic biology, which creates noble products through metabolic pathway engineering. Also, I am a member of the iGEM team of KAIST.
LEE, Namil Undergraduate student pig948@kaist.ac.kr
I will enter the KAIST graduate school. I’m interested in synthetic biology. I’m the iGEM team member of KAIST. I think it’s great opportunity for me. I want to research about pathway engineering and minimal genome.
CHOE, Donghui Undergraduate student robinald@kaist.ac.kr
I am an undergraduate student in Systems and Synthetic biology lab and also a member of team iGEM. I like playing tennis and baseball. I am a big fan of Lotte giants.

LEE, Jong Ho Undergraduate student sksmswhdgh@kaist.ac.kr
Hi! I am 3rd year undergraduate student in the Bio brain Engineering Department. I am passionate about bio-informatics and bio-instrumentation. In our iGEM Team, I make some awesome homepage with Suli Lee. We usually work with computers. I really enjoy our work. I think this iGEM competition is really good opportunity to learn not only biological subject but ‘some skills' with computer, such as making homepage, modeling experiments and etc.
