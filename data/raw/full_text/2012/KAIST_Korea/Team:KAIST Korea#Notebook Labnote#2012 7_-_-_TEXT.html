Moth_0109, 1202 PCR
As TOPO cloning of Moth_0109 and 1202 gene failed, we ran one more PCR to prepare for TOPO cloning. Results
For each of the two genes, correct size of oligonucleotide exists in the PCR product. We noticed that there is an other restriction enzyme site in the Moth 0109, 1202. It means that it’s impossible to reuse TOPO vector. We got other vector which has same pBAD promoter with TOPO cloning. Also we redesigned the primer for Moth 0109, 1202.
pre-culture of Moth_1197 and 1198 inserted MG1655 cell.

Induction of Moth_1197, Moth_1198 gene (sampling) and running SDS-PAGE gel.
We induced Moth_1197 and Moth_1198 gene in pTrcHis2A and pBAD vector with various IPTG and L-arabinose conditions: IPTG 0.5mM, 1mM and Arabinose 10mM, 30mM (0.02% and 0.2%). Temperature conditions are : 37℃, 30℃. Cells were cultured anaerobically in the anaerobic chamber. After 6 hours of induction, we run the sample into SDS-PAGE gel. The gel is stained with coomassie blue for 1 hour and de-stained for overnight.

Moth_1197-pBAD/TOPO expression check (Result)
Results
Discussion For each samples of different induction conditions, we run SDS-PAGE gel and checked the presence of 28.61 kDa protein, Methyltetrahydrofolate : corrinoid/iron sulfur protein methyltransferase. The band significantly appeared slightly above 42kDa. This means that protein has N and C terminal tag, of which the size is 13kDa and 3kDa each.
28.61kDa + N-term Thioredoxin 13kDa + C-term V5, 6xHis 3kDa = 44.61kDa
Therefore, the product protein locates slightly above 42kDa ladder.
Moth_1197-pTrcHis2A expression check (Result)
Results
Discussion For each samples of different induction conditions, we run SDS-PAGE gel and checked the presence of 28.61 kDa protein, Methyltetrahydrofolate : corrinoid/iron sulfur protein methyltransferase. The band significantly appeared between 24kDa and 35kDa. This means that protein has C terminal tag,
28.61kDa + 2.14kDa = 30.75kDa
The band that does not exist on negative sample is roughly on this size. Therefore, we can say that this protein is also expressed on pTrcHis2A vector. However, we decided to use pBAD/TOPO vector because it has expressed the protein more significantly.

piBR181 vector arrived
piBR181 vector is known to accommodate oligonucleotide over 100kb. This vector was made from commercial pET-28a (+) vectors to accommodate standardized Biobricks parts. The work proceeded by designing a 181 bp long synthetic DNA fragment for efficient construction of an expression vector for monocistronic assembly of genes provided that each contains its own promoter, operator, ribosome-binding site and transcriptional terminator. A 181 bp long ds DNA construct was designed and ligated to pET-28a (+) (5369 bp) at BglII and XhoI restriction sites to generate piBR181 (5301 bp) expression vector replacing original bio-parts. The newly constructed vector contains SpeI-HindIII single cloning restriction site between RBS and TT sites however, BglII and BamHI/XhoI restriction sites are present before promoter and after TT sites for multi-monocistronic operon assembly.
We got this standardized vector and vector map from Professor Jae Kyung, Song and it arrived today. ▶▶Click to download Original document of piBR181 vector

Results
There was no band appeared on the gel, which means that we don’t have any colony with Moth 0109 gene.

Moth_1202-pTrcHis2Aexpression check (Result)
Results
Discussion For each samples of different induction conditions, we run SDS-PAGE gel and checked the presence of 81.72kDa protein, bifunctional acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase complex subunit alpha/beta. Although the band appeared slightly between 75kDa and 90kDa, we were not certain that this band is from Moth 1202 gene expression. This band also exists on the negative sample. Therefore, we concluded that expression of 1202 gene on pTrcHis2A vector has failed.
Moth_2312-pBAD/TOPO expression check (Result)
Results
Discussion For each samples of different induction conditions, we run SDS-PAGE gel and checked the presence of 98.60kDa protein formate dehydrogenase subunit alpha. Although the band significantly appeared slightly above 42kDa, this was not the correct size of protein.       Therefore, we concluded that expression of 2312 gene on pBAD/TOPO vector has failed.

Discussion For each samples of different induction conditions, we run SDS-PAGE gel and checked the presence of 78.07kDa protein formate dehydrogenase beta subunit. The band was not certain on the gel image.       Therefore, we concluded that expression of 2314 gene on pBAD/TOPO vector has failed.

Results
The att B and att P sequences are recognition site of bacteriophage Bxb1 integrase. To prove our concept, we designed two plasmid called pPoC (proof of concept plasmid) and pPoCpi (proof of concept plasmid, promoter inverted). The pPoC insert and pPoCpi insert are cloned into pSB1C3 to become pPoC and pPoCpi. The three sequences - Bacteriophage Bxb1 integrase, sequences between BBa_E1010 and BBa_E0040 of the inserts, pPoC insert and pPoCpi insert – are synthesized through gene synthesis service provided by BIONEER.

Results
Discussion For each samples of different induction conditions, we run SDS-PAGE gel and checked the presence of 81.72kDa protein, bifunctional acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase complex subunit alpha/beta. Although the band appeared slightly above 75kDa, we were not certain that this band is from Moth 1202 gene expression. We thought that band of size 81.72kDa should be more biased towards 90kDa band.       Therefore, we concluded that expression of 1202 gene on pBAD vector has failed.
Moth_1198-pBAD/TOPO expression check (Result)
Results
Discussion For each samples of different induction conditions, we run SDS-PAGE gel and checked the presence of 35.08kDa protein acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synthase complex subunit delta. The band significantly appeared slightly above 42kDa. This means that protein has N terminal tag, of which the size is 13kDa.
35.08kDa + N-term Thioredoxin 13kDa = 48.08kDa
Therefore, the product protein locates slightly above 42kDa ladder
