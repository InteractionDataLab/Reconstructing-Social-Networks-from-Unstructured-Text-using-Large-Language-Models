Procedure
1) Pellet Cells

Centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 2.5minutes to pellet the cells.
Remove the supernatant.
2) Lyse Cells
Add 1ml of an overnight culture to a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube.
Centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 2.5minutes to pellet the cells.
Remove the supernatant.
3) Protein Precipitation
Add 200ul of Protein Precipitation Solution to the RNase-treated cell lysate. Vortex vigorously at high speed for 20seconds to mix the Protein Precipitation Solution tieh the cell lysate.
Incubate the sample on ice for 5minutes.
Centrifuge at 13,000rpm 3minutes.
Transfer the supernatant containing the DNA to a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube.
Note: Some supernatant may remain in the original tube containing the protein pellet. Leave this residual liquid in the tube to avoid contaminating the DNA solution with the precipitated protein.
Add 600ul isopropanol.
Gently mix by inversion until the thread-like strands of DNA form a visible mass.
Centrifuge at 13000rpm for 2minutes.
Carefully pour off the supernatant.
Add 600ul of room temperature 70% ethanol and gently invert the tube 5 times to wash the DNA pellet.
Centrifuge at 13000rpm for 2minutes. Carefully aspirate the ethanol.
Drain the tube on clean absorbent paper and allow the pellet to air-dry for 10-14minutes.
Add 50~100 μl TE buffer and rehydrate the DNA by incubating at 65℃ for 20min. Periodically mix the solution by gently tapping the tube. Alternatively, rehydrate the DNA by incubationg the solution overnight at room temperature or at 4℃.

5. Gel extraction
Materials
MGTM Gel Extraction SV - Macrogen
Procedure
Excise the DNA band of interest using an ethanol-cleaned razor blade.
Weigh the gel slice in a microcentrifuge tube. Add 3 volumes (ul) of Buffer GB to 1 volume (mg) of gel.
Incubate at 50°C until the agarose gel is completely melted (5 ~ 10 min).
Transfer the mixture to a MGTM SV column. Centrifuge for 1 min. Discard the pass-through and re-insert the MGTM SV column into the Collection Tube.
Add 700 ul of Buffer NW to the MGTM SV column. Centrifuge for 30 sec. Discard the pass-through. Reinsert the MGTM SV column into the Collection Tube.
Centrifuge for additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. Transfer the MGTM SV column to a new 1.5 ml tube.
Apply 30ul of Buffer EB to the center of the membrane in the MGTM SV column, let stand for 1 min, and centrifuge for 1 min.
6. PCR purification
Materials
AccuPrep® PCR Purification Kit - BIONEER
Procedure
Add 5 volumes of PB Buffer to 1 volume of the PCR reaction.
Apply the sample to the Binding column tube to bind DNA.
Centrifuge for 30-60 sec to make the sample pass through the Binding column tube.
Discard flow-through and place the Binding column tube in the same tube.
Add 500μl of WB Buffer to the  Binding column tube and centrifuge for 30-60 sec to wash.
Discard flow-through and place the Binding column tube in the same tube again.
Centrifuge the Binding column tube for an additional 1min for drying.
Place the Binding column tube in a clean 1.5 ml tube.
Add 30μl of EL Buffer to the center of the Binding column filter, and let the column stand for 1 min.
Centrifuge for 1 min to elute.
7. Mini-prep (Plasmid extraction)
Materials
