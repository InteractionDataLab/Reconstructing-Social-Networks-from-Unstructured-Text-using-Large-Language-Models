1516 PCR for Gibson assembly.
Results
Discussion Also for this time, there was no right size of band appeared for 1516 gene. We, 1. changed the fraction of primers down to 0.5ul each, (lane 1) 2. changed the polymerase to pfu-x, (lane3) 3. used hybrid primers ( TOPO forward, Gibson reverse : lane 4 and TOPO reverse, Gibson forward : lane 5) Lane 2 was the control experiment with Hotstartaq polymerase.
Pre-culture of piBR181 vector containing cells.
Procedure We did 3ml pre-culture on five 10ml tubes for the cells containing each gene. Cell was grown about 16hours after pre-culture, and then induced with proper inducer.

Discussion To amplify the amount of each fragments, we did PCR amplification of 1198 once more. And we did PCR amplification of 1516 gene once more with the same primers. For 1516 gene, we couldn’t have right size of band for new primers. So we decided to use the fragments of 1516 that does not contain terminator sequence.

Moth_0109 expression optimization _ gel picture
Results
Discussion For each samples of different induction conditions, we run SDS-PAGE gel and checked the presence of 59.94kDa protein, formate--tetrahydrofolate ligase. The gel was ruined during staining/destaining procedure, and we couldn’t find any band for this protein. Therefore, we concluded that expression of 0109 gene on pBAD vector has failed and decided to try once more.

Discussion For each samples of different induction conditions, we run SDS-PAGE gel and checked the presence of 33.92kDa protein, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. The gel was ruined during staining/destaining procedure, and we couldn’t find any band for this protein. Therefore, we concluded that expression of 1191 gene on pBAD vector has failed and decided to try once more.

Discussion For the Gibson assembly with RE digestion of vector, we had several problems with de-phosphorylation and purification after de-phosphorylation. Therefore we decided to PCR-amplify the piBR181 vector and use the PCR product in Gibson assembly.

Moth_0109 pBAD expression check
Results
Discussion For each samples of different induction conditions, we ran 10% SDS-PAGE gel and checked the presence of 59.94kDa protein, formate--tetrahydrofolate ligase. We couldn’t find any band for this protein. There was no significant band on the gel, so we couldn’t conclude that this protein is expressed. Our opinion is that we should run Western blot to exactly find this protein.

Results
Discussion For each samples of different induction conditions, we run 15% SDS-PAGE gel and checked the presence of 33.92kDa protein, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. Although we were not able to discriminate each band of insoluble fraction, We could find that there exists right band at the right size.

Discussion For each samples of different induction conditions, we run 8% SDS-PAGE gel and checked the presence of 40.37 kDa protein, Formate dehydrogenase. We couldn’t find any band for this protein. There was no significant band on the gel, so we couldn’t conclude that this protein is expressed. Our opinion is that we should run Western blot to exactly find this protein.

Gibson assembly – assembly of pcr fragments (pcr fragment of vector added)
Results Among three methods to assemble DNA fragments, we chose third method, which is assembly of PCR amplified DNA fragments and vector.     0.17umoles of each fragments are added into the reaction sample, and volume to be added for each fragments has calculated on the assumption that average MW of each base is 660Da. Table below is the result of calculation.
After 1 hour of incubation on 50℃, the vector was transformed into TOP10 and NEB competent cell. Cells were plated and grown overnight during colony formation.
