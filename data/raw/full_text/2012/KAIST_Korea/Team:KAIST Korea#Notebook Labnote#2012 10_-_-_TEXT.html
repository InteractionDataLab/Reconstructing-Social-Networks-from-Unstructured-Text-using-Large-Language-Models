Plasmid gel electrophoresis
Results
Plasmid of Gibson fragment 1 (sample 1~10) were run on the gel to see if there is any problem with plasmid mini-prep process. Discussions It seems that this vector is supercoiled form, of which the size is about 10000bp.

bFMO template preparation with new primer
Results
We have found that our bFMO sequence was wrong. So that we have ordered new primers with right sequence.

pAutoIntegrase cloning check
Results
Discussion We have checked the result of cloning with various ways but we can’t sure about the success of cloning.

Restriction enzyme cut
Results Fragment 1 was digested with Hind III and Not I. Digestion of vector generates four fragments, the size of each fragments are as follows: 15280bp, 6593bp, 5748bp, 3000bp. Fragment 2 was digested with Not I and Xho I. Digestion of vector generates three fragments. The size of each fragments are as follows : 11213bp, 9010bp, 2207bp. Table below is composition of each enzyme reaction.
Discussions Different from our prediction, bands appeared at the wrong size, about the exact size of the vector. Therefore, we could conclude that colonies F1 1~10 and F2 1~5 contain background vectors.
Restriction enzyme cut _ gel 2
Results
Discussions For colony 6, 8, and 10, there appeared correct size of whole vector size. It seemed that Not I or Xho I was not active on the reaction condition and only one of those two enzymes cut circular DNA into linear DNA.
Pre-culture of Gibson F1 colonies
Additional 10 colonies for fragment 1 were picked, and culture into 3mL LB media containing 30ul Kanamycin.

Visualization of inversion from GFP to RFP
Procedure bfmo gene is constructed in the vector(pJ401, Km registance) and transformed into DH5α.50λ cell from stock is inoculated in 5mL LB
Visualization of inversion from GFP to RFP
Procedure We sampled the cell every 3hr. We induced one group of samples and un-induced another group of samples as a control. We took the picture of cell with confocal microscope at absorbance 500nm for GFP expression and 600nm for RFP expression. Results
Discussion We obtained proper data. Un-induced sample doesn’t show measurable RFP expression throughout the culture. However, induced sample shows the increase of RFP expression. Increase of GFP level in induced sample is due to the stability of GFP and time delay before inversion.

Cell culture in 96-well plate for Indigo expression time optimization
Procedure We set the O.D value to 0.1 and cultured 1.5ml cell in 96 deep well plate. At each time point, we transferred 1ml cell from 96 deep well plate to EP tube and 200λ cell to flat 96 well plate for O.D check. After cell down in EP tube, we discarded the supernatant and resuspended the pellet in 200λ DMSO. We did sonication to the sample and after another cell down, we took the supernatant for TECAN measurement. Also, we checked absorbance after 3 days incubation and before 3days incubation. We used TECAN at absorbance 620nm to measure the quantity of indigo production Results
We subtracted absorbance value of pure LB from value of samples and we set all samples to have same amount of cell using O.D value Graph shown below is indigo intensity per cell. After 3 days incubation, indigo seems to be degraded and all the samples seem to have almost same indigo level.
We excluded 0hr data from the graph to see teh rising tendency clearly.
Discussion This data shows that the cell successfully produces indigo. We can use this gene as a reporter of our module. However, we only checked the increase of indigo. It may decrease after prolonged culture. We should do additional experiments to get the peak in the graph and optimize the production time of indigo.
