1.   Fluorescence microscope results
Our plasmid design contains a RFP and GFP. Fluorescence microscope pictures Figure 1 shows that GFP is expressed.
(Figure 1 Those bacteria who express GFP is seen under the fluorescence microscope activated by 488nm light.The  picture shows the expression of the GFP. )
2.Flow cytometry results
Figure2-a
Figure2-b
Flow cytometry results of GFP expression in experiment group Figure2-a and control group Figure2-b.The average GFP fluorescence strength of control group is 432 unit and of experiment group is 251 unit. Therefore, the terminator efficiency is 251/432=0.58
3.Agreement with theoretical prediction
(Figure 3 The horizontal ordinate represents the value of efficiencies measured by experiment. The vertical ordinate represents the value of efficiencies predicted by TTEC. We can see a good agreement between experimental efficiency and TTEC predicted efficiency.)
(Figure 4 Here listed the sequences of  terminator whose efficiencies are measured in the lab.)
