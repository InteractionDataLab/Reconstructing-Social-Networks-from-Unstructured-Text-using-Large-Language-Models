Everyone continued yesterday’s work, but didn’t make much progress. We’ve approached a  bottleneck of our project. This afternoon, we had a meeting with BGI, and talked about how we can cooperate with each other in the near future. We guided BGI’s walking tour of our school. What a pity we didn’t get a chance to have dinner together.

We finally optimized our program and uploaded it to our web page.
We prepared our PPT for tomorrow’s meeting in Hong Kong.

BGI and our team visited The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology together to communicate with their IGEM team members. We learnt a lot from them and found out that we still have a lot of things to do. Fortunately, we knew what we need to improve.
We relaxed ourselves and had great fun this afternoon.
