Site-Directed Mutagenesis
We choose plasmid psb1a3 to be the vector that ligate GPF and RFP fragments.To protect the structural integrity of the constructed plasmid, we need to mutate a restriction enzyme cutting site named Pst I to Afl II. Proper primer are designed for this purpose.

Restriction Enzyme Digestion for Verification
After the PCR mutation we have to do a restriction enzyme digestion to test whether the mutation is successful. The reaction system is as follows:
1.  Prepare the control reaction as indicated below:
Total: 10μl
+ 0.5μl of Pst I restriction enzyme
+ 1μl of 10XH buffer
+ 1μl of plasmid DNA
+ 7.5μl of ddH2O
2.  Prepare the sample reaction as indicated below:
Total: 25μl
+ 0.5μl of Afl II restriction enzyme, #ER0831
+ 1μl of 10XM buffer
+ 1μl of plasmid DNA
+ 1.0μl of 0.1% BSA
+ 6.5μl of ddH2O
After the reaction, do an electrophoresis to see the 2k bp cyclic plasmid DNA change into linear. The process is as follows:
3. Prepare electrophoresis gel by adding 0.6g agarose to 60ml TAE (1% solution,1X,diluted from 50X TAE). Pour on conical flask and cover the Conical flask sealing surface with silver paper to avoid the loss of water vapor. Place in the microwave and microwave on middle for 1 minute at a time, pulling it out and swirling until solution is homogeneous again, then repeating (BE CAREFUL to watch the solution closely when swirling–it superheats and can boil over and cause severe burns). Continue until solution is seen clear and homogeneous with no exsistence of solid.Add 3 μl of (神马情况！！！)
4. By inserting the pipette tip below the TAE liquid and into the well, add 5μl of 1kb DNA ladder solution to first (and last if desired) well, skip one well, then begin adding the 5μl of digested DNA solutions mixed with 1μl loading buffer (6X) to the wells.
5. Place the cover on the electrophoresis unit, plug into the power source, and turn on voltage to 120V, set time to 30 minutes, and press the start button twice,leave when bubbles are seen. DNA separation can be observed as time goes on by turning off the power supply then gently removing the basin from the electrophoresis unit (be careful not to let the gel slip out of the basin) and placing on the UV transilluminator to see DNA bands.
6. When the desired level of separation is obtained, the basin can be placed on the transilluminator for picture taking(Of the absence of transilluminator,we use camera to take pictures with the UV light ).
Media Preparation
For all experiments involving the bacterial biomass and experimentation, proper media is chosen to grow the cells. Commonly,we use Lysogeny broth media for E. coli. The following is the media compositions and their quantities.
Lysogeny Broth (LB) liquid media (1 L)
Measure out these following:
Bacto-Tryptone - 10 g
NaCl - 10 g
Yeast Extract - 5 g
Add ddH2O and 5mmol/L Tris Buffer in a measuring cylinder to ensure accuracy, to make a total of 1 liter and pH is 8.0.
Lysogeny Broth (LB) solid media (1 L)
Measure out these following:
Bacto-Tryptone - 10 g
NaCl - 10 g
Yeast Extract - 5 g
Difco Agar - 15g
Add ddH2O and 5mmol/L Tris Buffer in a measuring cylinder to ensure accuracy, to make a total of 1 liter and pH is 8.0.
Autoclaving
Autoclave at 121 °C for 45 minutes (liquid setting, 0 minutes drying time). For making plates, after the media cool enough, antibiotics Ampicillin(0.6*10^-3 volume of media ) are added. At last media are poured 15ml on each plate and become solid.
Bacterial Transformation
Introduction of exogenous DNA into cells using non-viral methods is called “Transformation”.Transformation is commonly used to introduce recombinant plasmid DNA into bacterial strains which can transform naturally or can be made competitive for transformation by artificial means.
Depending on the expected transformation efficiency, there are two main types of competent cells that can be used for transformation.
1.Chemically competent cells
Chemically induced competent cells are calcium chloride-treated to facilitate attachment of the plasmid DNA to the competent cell membrane. During chemical transformation, the cells are heat-shocked in a water bath; which opens the pores of the cell membrane allowing entry of plasmid DNA from the buffer.
2.Electrocompetent cells
Electrocompetent cells are prepared for transformation using electroporation, a method that uses an electrical pulse to create pores through which genetic material enters the cells. This method usually has high transformation efficiency.
Procedure
1. Take out an appropriate number of tubes that contain competent cells(100μl ) from the -80℃ refrigerator. Immediately place the tubes on ice, so that all but the cap is surrounded by ice. Allow the cells to thaw on ice for 2-5 min.
2.  Visually check the cells to see whether they have thawed and gently flick the cells 1-2 times to evenly resuspend the cells.
3. Add 10μl PCR products(mini-prep purified) to the competent cells DH-5α. Stir gently to mix and return the tube to the ice, making sure that the tube is surrounded by ice except for the cap. Repeat for additional two times for the same samples.
4. Incubate the tubes on ice for 30 min.
5. Place the tubes in a 42°C water bath for exactly 90 sec; do not shake.
6. Place the tubes on ice for 2 min to cool down.
7. Add 800 l of room temperature LB medium to each tube.
8. Shake the tubes vigorously at 37°C for 45-60 min.
9. Centrifuge the tubes at 3K RPM for 1 min. Discard the supernatant liquor and leave 100-200 μl of the mixtures.Mix the contents and spread the whole liquid on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic ampicillin for the plasmid.
10. Let the plates sit on the bench for several min to allow excess liquid to be absorbed, and then invert and incubate overnight at 37°C (12-16 h).
Make sure that all these steps should be done in super clean bench to avoid contamination.
bacterial Colony PCR for Verification
After the growth of E.coli, then pick up some colonies from the plate and do a colony PCR verification. (体系！！！)Do an electrophoresis to test which colony is positive.  Besides, the colonies we choose should also be stored, we can incubate these colonies in one plate after every colony has been marked.
Culture the Bacteria
Pick up the positive colonies and throw it to 5ml LB liquid media using 12.5ml centrifuge tube. Then culture the bacteria in 37℃ overnight.
Plasmid DNA Isolation

When done properly, the ligation will result in a successful combination of the insert and plasmid into one plasmid.
