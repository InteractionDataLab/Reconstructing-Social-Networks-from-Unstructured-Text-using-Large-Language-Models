Abstract
We came back to school to continue our work in school. So we had to deal with some problems such as our own laboratory and our plan in next week.
Week 1
9.02.2012-9.08.2012
9.03.2012
Tonight, we had our first human practice. We gave a lecture on synthetic biology to the freshman in our school, and showed them the blueprint of this field. Then we did a presentation on what we are doing right now. They showed great interests in our project and would like to join us.
9.04.2012
We had a meeting to discuss our plan for September. Each group member was assigned a specific role: Zhang Mengshi, Liu Xianggeng and I will be responsible for experiments. Wu Zishan and Shen Liuxing will prepare the lecture and posters which will be used in our planned tours to a couple of high schools in Shenzhen. We are going to introduce synthetic biology and our project to them. Chen Yao and Qie Boyu will optimize our program and finish our web page.
9.05.2012
We paid a visit to SIAT to discuss the potential of using their lab for our experiments. Luckily, they agreed.
Week 2
9.09.2012-9.15.2012
9.10.2012
We had a meeting to check whether our plan goes well. However, because of the new semester, it is a little bit harder to keep up with our schedule. I decided to put the deadline to 9.15.
9.15.2012
We had a meeting to discuss our plan for September. Each group member was assigned a specific role: Zhang Mengshi, Liu Xianggeng and I will be responsible for experiments. Wu Zishan and Shen Liuxing will prepare the lecture and posters which will be used in our planned tours to a couple of high schools in Shenzhen.

Week 3
9.16.2012-9.22.2012
9.17.2012
After all the material we bought arrived, we started our lab work again in our school. It’s a hard work to develop our own laboratory. But we had fun at the same time.
We did a digest and amplify GFP & RFP with PCR.
9.18.2012-9.20.2012
We visited 3 high schools and gave presentations to their students on synthetic biology and our IGEM projects. There are many students being interested in biology and some of them would like to join this competition. We think our major goal has been achieved. We also did a ligation to connect GFP, RFP and the plasmid together. Then we did a transformation.
9.21.2012
Today’s morning, we saw that control group almost exist only few of bacterial colony and the experimental group grow lots of colonies. I think it is a positive suggest. So we did a colony PCR to test whether the ligation is successful. We picked up 10 colonies to test and three of them is positive ligated by three parts and all the colonies are positive ligated by two parts.
9.22.2012
We picked up those colonies which are positive.  Through the bacterium culture in shake-flask more than 12 hours, we can do plasmid miniprep.
We also started to record our open classes.
Because the deadline of wiki is coming so almost every team members are busy in writing their parts.
Week 4
9.23.2012-9.27.2012
This is the last week to edit our wiki, so does our project. So our team members spared no efforts to accomplish the work. Thankfully, we finished our work before the deadline.
