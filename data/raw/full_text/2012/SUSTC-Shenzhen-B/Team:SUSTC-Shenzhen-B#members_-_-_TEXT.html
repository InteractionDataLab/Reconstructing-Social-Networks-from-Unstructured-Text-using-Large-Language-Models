Shui Jing
I’m Shui Jing, a sophomore and still don’t have major. All the wonders in physics and biology attract me so much that I really enjoy the process of learning.
In my spare time, I am involved in all kinds of sports, such as basketball, badminton, table tennis swimming and many more.  As a team leader, my major task in this project is arranging the team affairs, I am also responsible for our wiki. I think I have learned a lot from this special experience. learning how to cooperate with team members from different background and different characters and how to shoulder the responsibilities I have to face are not as easy as what you say. The more difficulties I overcome, the more mature I will be.
I hope everyone can have fun in IGEM and enjoy the process.

ZiShan Wu
I’m Zishan Wu. My friends call me big potato because I am like the cartoon character in ‘Old Master’. I always think I am lucky because I met many wonderful things. So, joining in iGEM team is my luckiness ,too.Our team divide into lab group and theory group. I chose the theory group because I liked writing programs and reading some intersting papers. I really enjoyed the process where I learned many things and got closer to our goal step by step.

I am Chen Yao. I like writing and reading, and I love science. I like both failure and success. Failure makes me mature, and success after many times of failure makes failure meaningful. I attended iGEM because I really enjoyed doing something special. In our team, I am one of the "programmers" and I wrote the program hairpinscore in C#.
BoYu Qie
You can call me Qie Boyu, which is my name, or Qie Ye, which means grandfather Qie made by my friends to show their honour(ahahaha~). I'm from Chengdu, the best city in the world. In order to find some meaningful project to do in the summer vacation, I take part in our iGEM team though I nearly didn't known everything out of biology tought in high school. Doing the project with my friends is very cool, I totally fall in love with the process of it. I'm loving it !
Xianggeng Liu
I am Xianggeng Liu, a undergraduates from SUSTC, and will major in chemistry. I am responsible for  database, lab and wiki. My hobbies are chemistry, history and football. iGEM gives me a chance to understand synthetic biology and do some research, which makes me enjoy science.
Liuxing Shen
Hi, I'm liuxingshen and a member of terminator team. Instead of wetlab, I focused on lecture and computer stuffs. This was my first time to involve in a big team projects and I found so much things new and fascinating. During this summer ,I have learned how to trust teammates and how to distribute the tasks to them. Sometimes, I was tired and desperate but, after all, it was a thrill to experience something like this!
