SynBio Intro
Plasmid Construction
A goal of synthetic biology is to standardize the form of genetic components to prevent structural elements of components from changing with reactions. It provides a standard method of assembling genetic components using specified prefixes and suffixes. Prefixes include EcoRⅠ and XbaⅠ; suffixes include SpeⅠ and PstⅠ.
The recognition site of XbaⅠ:
(Figure 3)
The recognition site of SpeⅠ:
(Figure 4)
The same cohesive terminus enable them to connect with each other. However, after the combination, neither XbaⅠnor SpeⅠis able to recognize this sequence. Through this way we could achieve the goal of building BioBricks.
We can see from the picture(Figure 2) that there are 4 standard restriction enzyme cutting sites:  EcoRⅠ, XbaⅠ, SpeⅠ,PstⅠ.
(1) As we will use pstⅠto be the restriction cutting site of terminators, if we want to ligase GFP to the plasmid, this restriction cutting site should be mutated.
The recognition site of PstⅠ:
(Figure 5)
The recognition site of AflⅡ:
(Figure 6)
Since AflⅡis similar to PstⅠ,they just have 2 different base pairs, we used these primers:
PtoA-F
5'-CCACCTGACGTCTAAGAAAC-3'
PtoA-R
5'-CTTAAGCGGCCGCTACTAGTA-3'
to mutate the vector.
(2) After the mutation succeeded, the next step is to connect sequences of GFP & RFP to the vector. These sequences were built by PCR extension.
To digest GFP sequence, we used SpeⅠand AflⅡ. We also digested the vector with the same restriction enzyme cutting sites. During the process of base complementary pairing, GFP sequence could be ligated onto the vector with the help of T4 DNA ligase. At the same time, the recognition site of PstⅠ would be added to the vector.
To digest RFP sequence, we used NotⅠ and SpeⅠ. We also digested the vector with the same restriction enzyme cutting sites. During the process of base complementary pairing, RFP sequence could be ligated onto vector with the help of T4 DNA ligase. At the same time, the recognition site of XbaⅠwould be added to the vector.
We can either connect 3 fragments: GFP, RFP sequences and the plasmid at the same time, or connect 2 fragments first and then connect the other one. However, when carrying out the second scheme, we should decide which one to be connected first. According to the picture, GFP should be the one.
Besides:
We designed these primers to amplify RFP.
R-NPS-F
5'-TATAGCGGCCGCCTTAAGTAAGTAAGAGTATACG-3'
R-NPS-R
5'-CGGAGACTAGTCTGCAGATCACATAAGTAAAGTGATAATC-3'
We designed these primers to amplify GFP.
G-SXA-F
5'-CTAGACTAGTTCTAGAGGCGGACTCACTATAGA-3'
G-SXA-R
5'-CCGACTTAAGGGATCCTATAAACGCAG-3'
(3) Since we built up the vector through the steps before, we decided to use XbaⅠ,PstⅠto digest the vector.
The terminators were built by PCR extension.
Then we can ligated terminator into the backbone and transformed into competent cells.
Characterization devices testing the performance of the terminators utilized fluorescent proteins to measure input and output and altered the arabinose transport system to control inputs. The fluorescence produced by the characterization devices were then measured using flow cytometry to calculate the termination efficiency of the terminators.
