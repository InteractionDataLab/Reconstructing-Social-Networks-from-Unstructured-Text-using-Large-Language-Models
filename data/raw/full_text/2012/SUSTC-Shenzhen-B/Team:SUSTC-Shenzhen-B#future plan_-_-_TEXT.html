Future Version of Our Software
Introduction
Now our pc software  and online tool can predict the efficiency of rho-independent terminator. The algorithm is based on two scoring systems, which were created by d'Aubenton Carafa and Elena  A Lesnik respectively. In the future, we want to better predict the efficiency  of terminators using better formula and create a model of terminator efficiency prediction. What’s more, we hope we can do mutation on user’s  terminator sequence to give a derived terminator which meet the user’s requirement of efficiency.
Future Plan
1. Mutate the coefficients of the  scoring formular to help get the best simulation formular of score and  efficiency
The formula of d  score calculation is ：
D Score = nT *  18.16 + deltaG / LH * 96.59 – 116.87
(nT is the score of t tail, deltaG is the  energy change of the stemloop formation and LH is the length of stemloop  sequence.)
Here the coefficient of each terms can be  adjusted to help make the best simulation between score and efficiency. We can  even try to treat efficiency as a function of those terms directly, which means  we can calculate terminator efficiency using nt, deltaG and LH directly without  calculating the score first, ie : Efficiency = E(nt, deltaG,LH).
2. Create  a model of terminator efficiency prediction
The score of terminator includes two parts, stemloop and  ttail. We can do some experiments to know how stemloop and ttail effect the  efficiency of terminators and then create a model of that. We’ve bought about  100 terminators sequences. These sequences are mutated in their stem，loop  or t tail. We will measure their efficiency and then analyze the experiment  data to find some regular pattern and create our own model.
3. Modify  the terminator sequence to match the user selected efficiency
Sometimes the user wants a  terminator with specific efficiency. If the current efficiency of users  terminator is not the one he want, our program can do mutation on terminator  sequences and evolve a terminator that meets the requirement of efficiency.
