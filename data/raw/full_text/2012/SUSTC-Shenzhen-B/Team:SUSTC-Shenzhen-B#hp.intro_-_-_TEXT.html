Human Practice Overview
In order to promote the awareness and education of synthetic biology in China, this summer, SUSTC IGEM team has done a remarkable job in motivating all kinds of people to study synthetic biology.
1.Open Classes.
We have record 5 open classes and uploaded to the web aiming at giving people a whole picture of synthetic biology. These 5 classes cover many fields.
      a.  Introduction to synthetic biology. It focuses on the history and applications of this searching area.
      b.  Interesting stories about synthetic biology. We want to let more people have an interest in scientific research.
      c.  The third part is about central dogma. This is the most important and most beautiful theory in synthetic biology. We hope more people can know it.
      d.  BioBrick is the essence idea of synthetic biology.
      e.  The last part involves the lab work. Because biology is a kind of science that based on experiment. It will also be much fun for people who don’t have a chance to visit laboratory.
2.Article
2. Our team has written an article to help people distinguish synthetic biology from genetic engineering.
3.  Speeches in high schools.
We have hold 3 speeches in high schools to motivate high school students to study synthetic biology and guide them to participate in IGEM High School Division. We think that the development of a new subject really needs creative teenagers and future scientists to push forward.
4.  Posters.
Besides, we have made 8 posters to let people who attend our lectures have a further understanding of our project and synthetic biology.
