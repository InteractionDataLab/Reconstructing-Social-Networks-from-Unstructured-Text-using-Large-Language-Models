Abstract
2. We can do nothing but wait the sequences.
Week 2
8.05.2012-8.11.2012
8.05.2012
I didn’t assign any task to our team members, we could do anything we want.
8.06.2012-8.11.2012
It was the longest week I’ve ever felt. We waited our primer day after day but it didn’t come until August 12th. The package was delayed by the typhoon went through Shanghai(where the company we made the purchase from located)and a mistake the carrier made about the address.
During this week, we made a change to the sequence and handed another list to the company. We also read some articles on how to build a model.
