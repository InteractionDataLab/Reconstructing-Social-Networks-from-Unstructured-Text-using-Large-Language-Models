Restriction Enzyme Digestion for Verification
To verify whether PstI site in pSB1A3 was successfully mutated to AflII site, we performed restriction enzyme digestion experiments.
Bacterial plasmids are double-stranded circular DNA molecules and uncut plasmid DNA can be in any of three forms - nicked circular, linear, closed supercoiled. When run on an agarose gel one frequently will see these forms as different bands with closed supercoiled form migrates the fastest, linear form migrates the slowest, and nicked circular migrates in between. If the PStI site was successfully mutated to AflII site, we expected to see increased linear form of pSB1A3 when digested with AflII. SpeI-cut pSB1A3 was served as a positive control.
Method
1.  Set up Pst I digestion in 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes as described below:
Total: 10μl
+ 0.5μl of Pst I  restriction enzyme (company :Takara)
+ 1μl of 10XH buffer
+ 1μl of plasmid DNA
+ 7.5μl of ddH2O
2.  Set up Afl II digestion in 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes as described below:
Total: 10μl
+ 0.5μl of Afl II  restriction enzyme, (company :Takara)
+ 1μl of 10XM buffer
+ 1μl of plasmid DNA
+ 1.0μl of 0.01% BSA
+ 6.5μl of ddH2O
3. Incubate the eppendorf tubes in 37℃ water bath for 1-2 hr.
4. Prepare 1% agarose gel in Conical flask. Weigh 0.6 g agarose and add 60 ml 1x TAE (diluted from 50x TAE). Cover the Conical flask with silver paper to avoid the loss of water vapor. Place the Conical flask in the microwave and microwave for 1 minute with a middle power. Take it out and shake gently till the solution is homogeneous,(BE CAREFUL to watch the solution closely when shake it–it superheats and can boil over and cause severe burns). Continue microwave and swirl until solution is seen clear and homogeneous with no existence of solid. After cool down the agarose gel briefly, add 3 μl of Gelred (10000x ) and mix well. Pour the agarose gel in gel casting apparatus and insert combs.
5.  By inserting the pipette tip below the TAE liquid and into the well, add 5 μl of 1kb DNA ladder solution to first (and last if desired) well, skip one well, then begin adding the 5μl of digested DNA solutions mixed with 1 μl loading buffer (6x) to the wells.
6.  Place the cover on the electrophoresis unit, plug into the power source, and turn on voltage to 120V, set time to 30 minutes, and press the start button twice,until the bubbles are seen. DNA separation can be observed as time goes on by turning off the power supply then gently removing the basin from the electrophoresis unit (be careful not to let the gel slip out of the basin) and placing on the UV transilluminator to see DNA bands.
7.  When the desired level of separation is obtained, the basin can be placed on the transilluminator for picture taking(Of the absence of transilluminator,we use camera to take pictures with the UV light ).
8.  Cut the gel of specific position and collect it in tubes that have measured weight.
9.  Use DNA Gel Extraction Ki to purify the plasmid DNA mutant-pSB1A3. RPF (SpeI/AflII-digested), GFP (SpeI/AflII-digested) fragments were ligated into this vector, which was followed by insertion of designed terminator sequences between RFP and GFP, respectively.
(Figure 1  : This figure shows that the site-directed mutagenesis succeed ,we successfully  change a restriction enzyme cutting site named Pst I to Afl II. Lane 1  represents the plasmid mutant-pSB1A3,  lane 2 shows that the mutant-pSB1A3  cannot be digested by restriction enzyme Spe I ,lane 3 shows that mutant-pSB1A3 can be digested by restriction enzyme Afl  II.)
Media Preparation
For all experiments  involving the bacterial biomass and experimentation, proper media is chosen to grow  the cells. Commonly,we use Lysogeny broth media for E. coli. The following is the media compositions and their  quantities.
Method:
1.Prepare the Lysogeny Broth (LB) liquid media (1 L) as indicated below:
+ Bacto-Tryptone - 10 g
+ NaCl - 10 g
+ Yeast Extract - 5 g
Add ddH2O and 5mmol/L Tris Buffer in a measuring cylinder to ensure accuracy, to make a total of 1 liter and pH is 8.0.
2.Prepare the Lysogeny Broth (LB) solid media (1 L) as indicated below:
+ Bacto-Tryptone - 10 g
+ NaCl - 10 g
+ Yeast Extract - 5 g
+ Difco Agar - 15g
Add ddH2O and 5mmol/L Tris Buffer in a measuring cylinder to ensure accuracy, to make a total of 1 liter and pH is 8.0.
3. Autoclaving
Autoclave at 121 °C for 60 minutes. After the media cooling down enough, antibiotics Ampicillin(100mg of Ampicillin per 1ml of the media) are added. At last the media are poured 15ml on each plate and become solid.Store the plate at 4℃ refrigerator.
Bacterial Transformation
Transformation is commonly used to introduce recombinant plasmid DNA into bacterial strains which can transform naturally or can be made competitive for transformation by artificial means. The purpose of this technique is to introduce a recombinant plasmid DNA into a bacterial strains and to use bacteria strains to amplify the plasmid mutant-pSB1A3 for further plasmid construction. Method
1. Take out an  appropriate number of tubes that contain competent cells(100μl ) from the freezer. Immediately place the tubes on ice, so that all  but the cap is surrounded by ice. Allow the cells to thaw on ice for 2-5 min.
2.  Visually check the cells to see whether they  have thawed and gently flick the cells 1-2 times to evenly resuspend the cells.
3. Add 10μl PCR products(mini-prep purified) to the competent cells DH-5α.  Stir gently to mix and return the tube to the ice, making sure that the tube is  surrounded by ice except for the cap. Repeat for additional two times for the  same samples.
4. Incubate the  tubes on ice for 30 min.
5. Place the tubes  in a 42°C  water bath for exactly 90 sec; do not shake.
6. Place the tubes  on ice for 2 min to cool down.
7. Add 800 μl of room temperature LB medium to each tube.
8. Shake the tubes  vigorously at 37°C for 45-60 min.
9. Centrifuge the  tubes at 3K RPM for 1 min. Discard the supernatant liquor and leave 100-200 μl of the mixtures.Mix the contents and spread  the whole liquid on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic ampicillin  for the plasmid.
10. Place the  plates on the bench for several min to allow excess liquid to be absorbed, and  then invert and incubate overnight at 37°C (12-16 h).
Colony PCR for Verification
Colony PCR is used to identify and select cell colonies that have the correct plasmid inserted. The procedure is a way to do several PCR operations on cell colonies in parallel, to evaluate the results and select the corresponding positive cell colonies. After an overnight growth of E.coli, we can pick up several colonies from the plate and do a colony PCR verification. Besides, the colonies we choose and should also be stored, we can incubate these colonies in one plate after every colony has been marked.

Centrifuge the sample at max. speed of desk  top centrifuge and RT for 1min to pellet the cells.
Discard the supernatant. Remove as much of  the supernatant as possible without disturbing the cell pellet.
Repeat step 1 and 2 twice.
Resuspend the pellet completely in 250 ml of Solution I (containing RNase A) by vortexing  the samples vigorously . No clumps should be visible in the tube.
Add 250 ml of Solution II and mix the sample by gently inverting the  tube 4 to 6 times. Do not vortex or shake the sample vigorously. The bacterial  suspension should begin to clear which have lysed the bacterial cells in this  step. Warning: Do not stop here for more than five min, as the high pH  hurts your DNA!
Add 350 ml of Solution III and mix by gently inverting the tube 4 to  6 times until a flocculent white precipitate forms. Do not shake vigorously, as  it might break the genomic DNA.
Centrifuge at maximum speed for 10 min at  room temperature to pellet the cell debris. You should see a white precipitate  in the tube after the centrifugation.
While the samples are centrifuging, for  each sample, label a clean HiBind Miniprep Column which is to assembled in a  2-ml collection tube
Apply the supernatants from step 8 to the  columns.
Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min at  RT. Discard the flow-through in the collection tube.
Add 500 ml of Buffer HB to wash the Hibind Miniprep Column.  Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min at RT. Discard the flow-through in the  collection tube.
Wash the  column by adding 700 ml of DNA  Wash Buffer diluted with absolute ethanol. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1  min at room temperature and discard the flow-through.
Then centrifuge the tubes again for 2 min  to remove all the moisture.
Place the column in a clean 1.5 ml  eppendorf tube that is labeled with the plasmid name and group number. To elute  the DNA, add 50 ml of Elution Buffer  to the center of each column. Let the samples stand for 2 or more minutes at  RT, and then centrifuge for 1 min. The sample in the centrifuge tube (bottom)  is your plasmid DNA.
Discard the column and save the sample in  the eppendorf tube by placing it in the freezer (-20°C).

Flow Cytometer Analysis
Flow cytometry is a laser based, biophysical technology employed in cell counting, sorting, biomarker detection and protein engineering, by suspending cells in a stream of fluid and passing them by an electronic detection apparatus. It allows simultaneous multiparametric analysis of the physical and/or chemical characteristics of up to thousands of particles per second.
Each fluorophore has a characteristic peak excitation and emission wavelength, and the emission spectra often overlap. Consequently, the combination of labels which can be used depends on the wavelength of the lamp(s) or laser(s) used to excite the fluorochromes and on the detectors available. It is practical that the expression of RFP and GFP can be measured at the same time.
Method:
1. Materials:
  1.1. NaCl solution( 0.9% ,M/V)
  1.2. 75% ethanol
2. Procedures:
  2.1. Bacterium are harvested by centrifuge at 10000g for 30s, then discard the supernatant. Repeat this step again until we got adequate bacterium.
  2.2. Suspend the bacterium With NaCl solution(0.9%) and vibrate the centrifuge tubes until the bacterium are distributed homogeneous.
  2.3. Load the bacteria containing pSB1A3 to Flow Cytometer (Beckman), set the parameters. Measure the GFP-FL1 and RFP-FL2 by Cytometer.
Fluorescence  Microscope
A fluorescence microscope is an optical microscope that uses fluorescence and phosphorescence  reflection and absorption to study properties of organic or inorganic substances and generate an image.Fluorescence microscope detection are used to confirm the expression of GFP and RFP which are illuminated with light of a wavelength which excites fluorescence in the sample.
Method
Add 10μl of bacteria solution to micro slide and cover with coverslip. Placed the micro slide on the Fluorescence Microscope. Set parameters to detect GFP and RFP.
