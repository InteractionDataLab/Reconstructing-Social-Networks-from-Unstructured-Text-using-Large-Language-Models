Abstract
This week we plan to have a short vacation and discuss the next step of our project.
Week 3

7.29.2012
We took a break to get ready for the week ahead of us.
7.30.2012
We moved our work place from school to BGI to do some experiment there. All of us were excited about the move.
7.31.2012
1. We divided our team members into 2 groups. One will be focusing on reading paper and looking for the right terminator; the other one will be focusing on designing and doing experiment.
2. Our adviser Chen Yu gave us an instruction session an molecular biology to help us get started our work.
3. Moving to a new place is not an easy thing. We cleaned our dormitory.
