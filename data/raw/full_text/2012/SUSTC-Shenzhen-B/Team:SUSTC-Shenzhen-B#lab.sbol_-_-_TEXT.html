SBOL Document
Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) is a data exchange standard for descriptions of genetic parts, devices, modules, and systems. SBOL is neutral with respect to programming languages and software encoding. By supporting SBOL for reading and writing synthetic biology designs, different software tools can directly communicate and store the same representation of these designs. This removes an impediment to sharing engineered systems and permits other researchers and commercial enterprises to start with an unambiguous representation of the design.
The plasmids we construct are stored in gb and SBOL format.
