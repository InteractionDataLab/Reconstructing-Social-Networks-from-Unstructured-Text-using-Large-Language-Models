Introduction
    In order to estimate to what extent our YAO system has improved the ability of producing IPP, FPP and GPP in the engineered cell, we construct a model for biochemical reactions of mevalonate pathway in yeast.
    At first we plan to model the reactions at equilibrium states. However, as Gibbs free energy for most of the reactions in mevalonate pathway are unavailable, we decide to model them by Michealis-Menton kinetics at the beginning of the reactions when no products have been accumulated.

We set the concentration of Actyl-CoA to 1000μM, and consider it as a constant. For simplicity, we assume the concentration of Actyl-CoA is the same in YAO and cytoplasm.  The concentration of ATP, ADP and NADPH is set to 1500μM, 1500μM and 100μM respectively and considered as constants. Concentrations of all other metabolite are set to 0 in the beginning.
Result
    Our Yao clustered the enzymes in a small space, so that the concentration of enzymes in YAO will be higher than in cytoplasm. We assume that the volume of YAO is 1/10000 of that of cell, and a cell often contains 20 YAOs. Thus the concentrations of enzymes in YAO should be 500 times of that in cytoplasm. However, the transported rate of enzymes with signal peptides should be considered. We let it range from 0.002 to 1, thus ratio of concentrations of enzymes between YAO and cytoplasm range from 0 to 500.
    We then plot the concentration of IPP, GPP and FPP as a function of time at different concentration of enzymes.
Figure 1. Production of IPP at different concentrations of enzymes.
Figure 2. Production of GPP at different concentrations of enzymes.
Figure 3. Production of FPP at different concentrations of enzymes.
    We can see from the plot that the production of IPP, GPP and FPP in a certain period of time after the beginning of the reactions increase dramatically as the concentrations of enzymes increase.
    As the concentrations of products are increasing, need for ATP and NADPH also increase. The concentrations of NADPH and ATP will limit the produce of IPP, GPP and FPP. We then let the constant concentrations of NADPH and ATP range from 0 to maximum to see their affects on production.
Figure 4. Production of IPP at different concentrations of NADPH.
Figure 5. Production of IPP at different concentrations of ATP.
    Our results show that concentrations of both ATP and NADPH do not have significant affects on production at the beginning of the reactions.
