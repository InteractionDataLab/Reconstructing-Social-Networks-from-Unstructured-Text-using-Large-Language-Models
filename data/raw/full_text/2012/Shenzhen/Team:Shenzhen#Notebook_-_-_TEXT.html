Team History
November 10th - 12th, 2011
Events:
BGI College rucuiting, at SCUT, HUST, SCU, WHU, SEU, etc.
Lectures on synthetic biology and iGEM, "Programing Life", were given to WHU and HUST.
March 12th, 2012
Events:
March 12th. The first iGEM meeting was a very serious one, and there were only 5 members: Kang Chen Zhang Ou and Gong, respectively. SCUT and UESTC joined us.
We decided to build a list about the whole previous iGEM projects and divided it into five parts: America for Kang and Chen, Europe for Zhang and Ou, Asia for Gong. All of us were in charge of scanning the projects, summarized them and gave the other members a brief description. Each one for one minute.
March 17th, 2012
Events:
Xiaopeng XU from HUST joined us.
March 18th, 2012
Events:
Lectures on synthetic biology and iGEM, given to BGI College students.
March 26th, 2012
Events:
More students from WHU, HUST, SEU, SCU, SCNU and UESTCjoined us.
Rearrangements for everyone’s task on former project summary.
March 28th, 2012
Events:
Qiong Wu from CUHK joined us. 8 school consortium set up, named after BGI.
March 15th – April 13th, 2012
Events:
We continued to sum up the projects from 2008 to 2011, and in the meanwhile, we separated the whole into more parts and assigned to the other members. We finished the summary.
April 4th, 2012
Events:
Team name changed to Shenzhen.
Seminar for logo design and team VI.
Discussion on project selection. we originally put up with 4 schemes: Schrodinger’s cat—randomly producing 0 and 1; Density sensing application--based on the result of JIandong Wang’s research; Christmas tree—sparks different colors ceaselessly; Yeast artificial organelle—transform mitochondria into a biofactory.
April 7th, 2012
Events:
20 team members spent a whole day in KTV.
April 11th, 2012
Events:
3 projects were gave up due to the similarity to the previous iGEM projects. We lay down our consideration on Yeast artificial organelle.
Chen Yu search more articles about mitochondria transgene and mitochondrial signaling pathways he can and pack it as a file of endnote.
We clarify our projects as a combination of five modules: NAD+/NADH Sensor, self-killer, post-invader, sel-control transporter and artemisinin producer.
We divided our group into five parts according to the modules and select two members of each modules to make up two new squads—modeling construction and lab experiments.
April 14th, 2012
Events:
Team VI and logo design finished.
Modules rearrengement.
