Courses
With the help of the Unit of Synthetic Biology, we are trying to develop three synthetic biology related courses that can be shared with BGI College students:
 - Build a Genome, focusing on DNA assembly technologies,
 - Step into Genetic Circuits, focusing on basic molecular systems biology knowledge, designing principles and experimental methods,
 - Computational Systems Biology, focusing on the mathematical modeling work of natural or artificial systems.
