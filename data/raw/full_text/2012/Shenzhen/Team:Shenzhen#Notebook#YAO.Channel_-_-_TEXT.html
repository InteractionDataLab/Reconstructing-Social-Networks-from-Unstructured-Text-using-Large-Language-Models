Journal
Apr. 18th - Apr.22th
Events:
We found some papers related to transport systems for mitochondria to read. Several points we concerned for:
- 1) All kinds of transport systems in the mitochondria of yeast；
- 2) How the transport systems play their role in yeast
- 3) Important proteins in the transport system
- Several question remained to be answered:
- 1) Weather the present situations of the transport systems allow us to do a good classification
- 2) What’s the mechanism of assembling membrane proteins to the inner membrane.
- 3) If we use chloroplast’s SRP system, how to assemble the related proteins?
- 4) If we add new system in the outer membrane,how to let it work normally.
- The papers we read:
- 1) How mitochondria import hydrophilic and hydrophobic proteins. Agnieszka Chacinska, Nikolaus Pfanner and Chris Meisinger.TRENDS in Cell Biology Vol.12 No.7 July 2002
- 2) Converting bacteria to organelles: evolution of mitochondrial protein Sorting. Johannes M. Herrmann. TRENDS in Microbiology Vol.11 No.2 February 2003
- 3) Multiple pathways for sorting mitochondrial precursor proteins. Natalia Bolender 1,2, Albert Sickmann3, Richard Wagner 4, Chris Meisinger 1 & Nikolaus Pfanner 1+... EMBO reports (2008) 9, 42–49. doi:10.1038/sj.embor.7401126
- 4) Versatility of he mitochondrial protein import machinery. Nikolaus Pfanner and Andreas Geissler. NATURE REVIEWS  | MOLECULAR CELL BIOLOGY. VOLUME 2  | MAY 2001  | 339-349
- 5) Evolution of the Molecular Machines for Protein Import into Mitochondria, Pavel  Dolezal et al. Science 313,314 (2006);

Apr. 27th
Events:
- We read some papers and shared findings with others team members in our seminar:
- 1) More detail about how do proteins transporting membrane.And we find some 3D pictures that could clearly show this process.
- 2) Proteins that play important roles in this process.
- 3) The ways that these proteins assembled to membrane.
- The papers we read:
- 1) Functional cooperation and separation of translocators in protein import into mitochondria, the double-membrane bounded organelles. Toshiya Endo1,2,*, Hayashi Yamamoto1 and Masatoshi Esaki1, Journal of Cell Science 116, 3259-3267 © 2003 The Company of Biologists Ltd.doi:10.1242/jcs.00667
- 2) ignal-anchored Proteins Follow a Unique Insertion Pathway into the Outer Membrane of Mitochondria*，Uwe Ahting‡§, Thomas Waizenegger‡, Walter Neupert, and Doron Rapaport，JBC, October 22, 2004, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M410905200
- 3) Assembling the mitochondrial outer membrane, Nikolaus Pfanner,2 November 2004;doi:10.1038/nsmb852
Contributors:
- Denghui Liu, Luohao Xu, Chengran Zhou, Qinsi Liang.
May. 6th
Events:
- We held a meeting to discuss how to reform the system:
- We can use the TOM complex  and TIM complex of chloroplast to replace these of mitochondria.But we haven't acknowledge enough information of chloroplast,so we have to read more papers about transport system of chloroplast.
Contributors:
- Chengran Zhou,Luohao Xu,Denghui Liu,Yu Chen,Qinsi Liang, Kang KANG
May. 7th - May .21th
Events:
- Read the papers related to transport system of chloroplast and searched for the approach for assembly of the transport machine from chloroplast. the paper we read are as follows  :
- 1) Svesnikova, N., Grimm, R., Soll, J. & Schleiff, E. Topologystudies of the chloroplast protein import channel Toc75.Biol. Chem. 381, 687–693 (2000).
- 2) Functional cooperation and separation of translocators in protein import into mitochondria, the double-membrane bounded organelles. oshiya Endo1,2,*, Hayashi Yamamoto1 and Masatoshi Esaki1, Journal of Cell Science 116, 3259-3267 © 2003 The Company of Biologists Ltd.doi:10.1242/jcs.00667
Contributors:
- Denghui Liu, Luohao Xu, Chengran Zhou, Qinsi Liang.
May. 31th
Events:
- Seminar about how to reform transport system of mitochondria.
- We decided to employ Toc75, Toc34 and Tic proteins from Cyanidioschyzon Merolae to be our YAO. channel. Following are the papers we read:
- 1) Evolution of the Molecular Machines for Protein Import into Mitochondria , Pavel  Dolezal et al. Science 313,314 (2006);
- 2) Converting bacteria to organelles: evolution of mitochondrial protein Sorting. Johannes M. Herrmann. TRENDS in Microbiology Vol.11 No.2 February 2003
- 3) Signal-anchored Proteins Follow a Unique Insertion Pathway into the Outer Membrane of Mitochondria*，Uwe Ahting‡§, Thomas Waizenegger‡, Walter Neupert, and Doron Rapaport¶，JBC Papers in Press, October 22, 2004, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M410905200
Contributors:
- Kang Kang, Denghui Liu, Luohao Xu, Chengran Zhou, Qinsi Liang.
Jun. 1st
Events:
- Request Dr. Osami Misumi from Yamaguchi University the DNA and cells of Cyanidioschyzon Merolae
Contributors:
- Luohao XU
Jun. 11th
Events:
- We had a discussion about how to design our experiment:
- 4 signal peptides targeting to mitochondrial outer membrane, 1 targeting to inner membrane, 1 targeting to mitochondrial matrix and 1 targeting to chloroplast matrix, were selected from papers and databases
Contributors:
- Qiwu Xu, Denghui Liu, Luohao Xu, Chengran Zhou.
Jul. 20th - Aug. 20
Events:
- We designed the experiments of construction of signal peptide BioBricks and then synthesized the sequences and the adapters, followed by these experiments: :.
- Vector construction, yeast expression vector construction and yeast transformation
Contributors:
- Qiwu Xu, Mingyu Gan, Chengran Zhou
Aug. 8th
