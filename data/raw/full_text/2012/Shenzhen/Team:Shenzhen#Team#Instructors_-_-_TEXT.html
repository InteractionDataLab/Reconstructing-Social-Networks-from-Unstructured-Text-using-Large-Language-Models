In BGI, K2 is veeeeery famous for lurking on BBS and sarcasm! As a former champion in a national robot contest, a hacker, a web engineer, a designer, a magazine editor, a citizen reporter, a filmmaker and a drama actor, he has always too many wonderings, including how life works on its core database - genome. Cracking and hacking the code of life, making actors in cell perform on his scripts, has become the primary task of this young scientist.
Errrggg! Yu is busy!
He is Research Scientist in BGI Research Institute & ZMBH PhD Candidate.
As an observer, he is peering natural history. As an investigator, he is digging the design principle of molecular system. As an engineer, he is stacking molecular system with special function.
