A short video introducing our team, Shenzhen, a special consortium named after a city, and what is the co-cultured project in BGI College and how students united.
About the Consortium
Shenzhen is a special consortium named after a city. Team members are not from one school, but eight. In their 3rd or 4th year in university, some undergraduate students came to Shenzhen and joined a co-cultured program called Innovation Classes on Genomics, in BGI College. After lectures introducing synthetic biology and iGEM given by our instructor K2, 22 students from eight schools, including HUST, SCU, SCUT, UESTC, WHU, SCNU, SEU and CUHK, have decided to set up a united team for iGEM 2012.
Students from eight different universities have contributed to this project including:
 - Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China
 - Sichuan University, China
 - South China University of Technology, China
 - Wuhan University, China
 - University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, China
 - Southeast University, China
 - South China Normal University, China
 - The Chinese University of Hong Kong
