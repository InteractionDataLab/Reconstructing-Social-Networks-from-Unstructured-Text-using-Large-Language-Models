YAO sensor seminar：
Topic: Discuss the possibility of constructing a new mitochondrial sensor.
Agreement: Started investigating the involvement of Mitochondria in cancer, aging and apoptosis.
Contributors:
- Xiaopeng XU, Junjie BU, Chao FENG, Wenjing LI, Zhikun ZHAO, Yu CHEN, Kang KANG.

ROS is found to involve in cancer, aging and apoptosis. Mitochondria is an important place for ROS production. So if we can sense the ROS state, it might be an useful machine for our design. Next we need to investigate the mitochondria transcription machine.

May. 8th
Redoxilator module built by DTU-Denmark 2009 team gives up the inspiration to construct a NAD+/NADH sensor in mitochondria.
Contributors:
- Xiaopeng XU, Zhikun ZHAO
May. 28th
The basic design is engineered. The REX protein combined with an activator is expressed in mitochondria and bind to ROP to enhance the expression of GFP. Next comes the searching for mitochondrial activators.
Contributors:
- Xiaopeng XU, Junjie BU, Zhikun ZHAO, Wenjing LI.
May. 29th
MTF1 is a mitochondrial transcription factor. So the design of mitochondrial sensor is complete. Next comes the manufacturing of sequences.
Contributors:
- Xiaopeng XU, Junjie BU, Zhikun ZHAO, Wenjing LI.
May. 30th
The DNA sequences engineering of mitochondrial sensor is finished.
Contributors:
- Xiaopeng XU, Qiwu XU, Junjie BU.
Jun. 6th
Because of the disturbance from the nucleus produced MTF1, the design might work not that efficiently. So we need to find an alternative activator or redesign our module.

- Xiaopeng XU, Junjie BU, Zhikun ZHAO, Wenjing LI.
Jun. 10th
Request plasmids and strains form supporters.
Contributors:
- Xiaopeng XU, Qiwu XU, Chao FENG, Kang KANG.
May. 28th
The strains and plasmids arrived.
Contributors:
- Xiaopeng XU, Junjie BU, Chao FENG, Wenjing LI, Zhikun ZHAO, Kang KANG.
Jul. 15th
The original design is changed. REX is expressed in the nucleus and transported into mitochondria. It is used as a repressor to repress the expression of GFP in mitochondria.
Contributors:
- Chao FENG, Xiaopeng XU, Junjie BU, Yu CHEN, Kang KANG.
Jul. 18th
Remanufacturing of the DNA sequence is finished.
Contributors:
- Xiaopeng XU, Qiwu XU, Chao FENG.
Jul. 23rd- Jul. 26th
YAO. sensor story, pictures preparation and presentation design.
Contributors:
- Xiaopeng XU, Chao FENG, Junjie BU, Wenjing LI, Yu CHEN, Kang KANG.
Aug. 2nd - Aug. 25th
Scripts, BioBricks and pictures preparation for Wiki
Contributors:
- Xiaopeng XU, Min OU, Yang DENG, Yu CHEN, Kang KANG.
Sep. 6th - Sep. 21st
Modeling for YAO sensor. Preparation for documents.
Contributors:
- Xiaopeng XU, Xuefeng LUO.
