lux team member: Jinhee LEE, Sumiya KAWAI, Miho NARITA, Tomomi YOKOYAMA, Mayumi NAKAMURA
rhodopsin team member: Hiroto OKANO, Genki SAKAI, Hayato TSURUTA, Somin LEE
August
5-11
Meeting :
Small session on gene experiments using iGEM biobrick.
Lux team :
Design primers to clone lux operon from photobacterim phosphorium genome DNA.
19-25
Rhodopsin team :
construction of blue light sensor.
Pconst.(H)-RBS-NpSRII-9a.a.linker_NpHtrII-EnvZ-DT
sequence analysis of constructed blue light sensor biobrick.
Meeting :
lux team and rhodopsin team made small presentation about experiments.
26-9/1
Rhodopsin team :
construction of ⊿EnvZ competent cell
Meeting :
Our project title and team character was desided!
“Coli express for long distance communication”
Lux team :
lux operon was cloned from Photobacterim phosphorium genome DNA. Most sequence was confirmed by sequence analysis.
2-8
Meeting :
lux team and rhodopsin team made small presentation about experiments.
Rhodopsin team :
insertion of PompR(+)-RBS-GFP-DT under blue light sensor biobrick.(BBa_K769000)
plasmid extraction of blue light sensor + GFP and sequence analysis.
9-15
Lux team :
lux bio-brick (pSB1C3-PBAD-RBS-lux operon-DT) was constructed! E. coli TOP10 was transformed with this plasmid.
Evaluation of lux bio-brick. Luminescence was measured using plate reader. We could see luminescence in dark room.
Design primers to clone rib operon from E.coli genome DNA
lux bio-brick that constitutive expression of lux gene was constructed. We expected more luminescence using strong constitutive expression promoter.
Rhodopsin team :
evaluation of blue light sensor.
After preculture, transformants were culture under blue light or dark condition.
But cells were not growth well.
Meeting :
Our team T-shirt design idea has been completed.
16-22
Lux team :
rib operon was cloned from E.coli genome DNA. Most sequence was confirmed by sequence analysis
Evaluation of color change biobrick.
Meeting :
Presentation team
Poster session team
We began to design poster and slide.
23-29
Rhodopsin team :
Reevaluation of blue light sensor.
After preculture, transformants were culture under white light or dark condition.
Lux team :
evaluation of fast luminescence biobrick.
