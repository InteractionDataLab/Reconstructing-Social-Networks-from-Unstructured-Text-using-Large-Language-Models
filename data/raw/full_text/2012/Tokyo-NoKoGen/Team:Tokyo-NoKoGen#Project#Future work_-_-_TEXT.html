Future work
The main goal of our project is that blue light sensor receives lux luminescence and target gene is induced. But our constructed blue light sensor switches off the system under light condition which will stop us from constructing “Coli. Express” that can respond to light signal. To solve this problem, we will regulate the system using a repressor. Our idea is to use lacI repressor and construct this expression system.
Under dark condition, blue light sensor switches on the lacI transcription. lacI repress the transcription of mcherry.
Under light condition, blue light sensor switches off the lacI transcription and mcherry is induced
