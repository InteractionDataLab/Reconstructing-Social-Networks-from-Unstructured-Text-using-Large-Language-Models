Our Faculty Advisors
Dr. Kari Clase and Dr. Jenna Rickus acted as the faculty advisers and mentors to the team during the project by means of providing lab space and supplies, organization and administrative advice, and technical and scientific guidance.
Graduate Student Mentors
Graduate Students Rajtarun Madangopal ( BME), Janie Brennan (ChE and former Purdue iGEMmer ), Soo Jung Ha (Biotech), and Tony Pedley (MCMP) provided project support in technical expertise, experience with experimental design, trouble shooting, lab materials, and general guidance.
Additional Attributions
Additional training on PCR machine, OD spectrophotometer, centrifuge, Beckman Coulter Flow Cytometer, and carioclypse spectrophotometer was done by Rajtarun Madangopal,  Dr. Larisa Avramova (Integrated Screening Technologies, Purdue Bindley Bioscience Center), Dr. Lake Paul (Biophysical Analysis Lab), Justin Meyers, Purdue Flow Cytometry Facility Manager, and Rouxi Wu (Graduate Student, BME). With the assistance of Jing Liu, a graduate student in Agriculture and Biological Engineering, members of the team were trained in silica matrix formation and characterization as well as bioreactor protocols.
