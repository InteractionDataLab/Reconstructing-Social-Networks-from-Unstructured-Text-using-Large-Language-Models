Community Lab Development Meeting
THURSDAY JULY 19th 2012 3PM at the Noblesville City Hall
The Purdue iGEM Team will be presenting a report for the establishment of an educational biotechnology laboratory in Noblesville, Indiana. Seeking to promote the integration of biotechnology into modern education and visualize the “hybrid vigor” of engineering and biology, the development of the collaborative space will introduce a model of education with the end result of sustained entrepreneurship and investment in the community and future. Through this meeting, Purdue’s  iGEM team wishes to launch partnerships in logistics, education, and finance to realize the opportunity of the Community Lab.
The Biomaker Bench
Forward thinking and revolutionary, the idea of a Community Lab was pioneered by GenSpace in Brooklyn, NYC and has proliferated across the country since its inception in 2009. Now, Purdue iGEM is bringing this radical innovation to the Midwest as the Biomaker Bench of Noblesville.
The Biomaker Bench is visualized as a collaborative space established for K-12 education in biotechnology and synthetic biology. An open concept for discovery and hands-on engagement, the lab fosters skills in team work, entrepreneurship and project management, and a Do it Yourself culture in the bio-sciences.
For more information on the community lab concept, visit the website of the following community lab models:
GenSpace, Brooklyn, NY
BioCurious, Sunnyvale, CA
Harlem DNA Labs, Harlem, NY

Why Noblesville, Indiana?
Noblesville, Indiana is a thriving suburban community about 30 minutes north of the Indianapolis city center. The city is located in Hamilton County, which boasts the most educated workforce in the Midwest with 53% of residents having a college degree. As a result of a "progressive and aggressive" business development philosophy, the city is home to many major players in world market, and in addition lies in close proximity to many industrial giants in biotechnology 1.
Much like the state of Indiana itself, which has the nation's highest ranked Bioscience industry2, Noblesville has a wide diversity of resources in biotechnology companies. These resources and the culture innovation provide a fertile seeding ground for a community lab.
What is the Benefit?
Bridges students and community members outside of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) to the scientific community
Removes barriers to access for scientific education and exploration.
Provides infrastructure to educational research facilities and technologies.
Advances learning by engaging students in experiences that combine technical skills, scientific curiosity, teamwork and project management, and real-world opportunities.
Facilitates educational outreach programs to K-12 students in collaboration with industrial partners.
Provides opportunities for community involvement and interaction in a secondary and undergraduate curriculum.
Educates the community about the risks and rewards of synthetic biology.
What are the Challenges?
A community lab remains sustainable on the interest and upkeep of the local population. In addition to a commitment to success by the City of Noblesville, the iGEM Team is seeking collaboration with industrial partners and Purdue University.
