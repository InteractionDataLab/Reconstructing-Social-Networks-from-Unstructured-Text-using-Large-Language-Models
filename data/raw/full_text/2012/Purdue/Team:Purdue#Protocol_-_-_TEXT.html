LB Agar
We used a premade Becton, Dickinson and Comapany mix to make our LB agar.
Adding Antibiotics to LB
How to make LB liquid plus antibiotics:
Ampicillin – The frozen stock solutions of ampicillin are at 50mg/ml and 100mg/ml in H2O, and are marked with a red sticker.   The final concentration for LB liquid culture is 50ul/ml.  To obtain this in 100ml (the amount in each LB bottle), add 100ul stock solution.
Kanamycin – The frozen stock solutions of kanamycin are at 50mg/ml in H2O, and are marked with green.  The final concentration for LB liquid culture for growing plasmids is 50ug/ml, and for cosmids is 20ug/ml.  To obtain 50ng/ml in 100ml of LB, add 100ul stock solution, and to obtain 20ug/ml, add 40ul stock solution.
Tetracycline – The frozen stock solutions of tetracycline are at 15mg/ml in methanol and are marked with black.  The final concentration for LB liquid culture is 15ug/ml.  To obtain this in 100ml of LB, add 100ul stock solution.
Chloramphenicol – The frozen stock solutions of chloramphenicol are at 25mg/ml in 100% ethanol and are marked with purple.  The final concentration for LB liquid culture is 25mg/ml.  To obtain this in 100ml of LB, add 100ul stock solution.
How to make LB plates plus antibiotics:
Follow the recipe card in box for making LB plates, being sure to add the agar.  After autoclaving, and when the agar has cooled enough that it’s not too hot to touch (about 1 to 1.5hrs), add antibiotics as follows:
Ampicillin – add 1ml ampicillin (at 100mg/ml) per liter of agar to obtain a final concentration of 100ug/ml.  Mark the plate with a single red line on the side.
Kanamycin – add 1ml kanamycin stock (at 50mg/ml) per liter of agar to obtain a final concentration of 50ug/ml.  Mark the plates with a single green line on the side.
Tetracycline – add 1ml tetracycline stock (at 15mg/ml) per liter of agar to obtain a final concentration of 15ug/ml.  Mark the plates with a single black line on the side.
Chloramphenicol – add 1ml chloramphenicol stock (at 25mg/ml) per liter of agar to obtain a final concentration of 100ug/ml.  Mark the plates with a single purple line on the side.
SOB Media Recipe
2% w/v bacto-tryptone (20 g)
0.5% w/v Yeast extract (5 g)
8.56mM NaCl (0.5 g) or 10mM NaCl (0.584 g)
2.5mM KCl (0.186 g)
ddH2O to 1000 mL[4]
For maximum effectiveness, SOB media should have its pH adjusted to 7.0 by adding concentrated sodium hydroxide. Autoclave media to ensure sterility
SOC Media Recipe
In addition to the contents of SOB media
10mM MgCl2 (0.952 g) or 20mM MgSO4 (2.408 g)[2]
20mM glucose (3.603 g)
Alternatively, SOC can be made by adding small amounts of concentrated magnesium chloride and glucose solutions to pre-prepared SOB.
For maximum effectiveness, SOC media should have its pH adjusted to 7.0 by adding concentrated sodium hydroxide. Autoclave media to ensure sterility
Creating Chemically Competent Cells
The protocol for creating chemically competent cells is provided by the parts registry and can be found here.
Transforming Chemically Competent Cells
The protocol for transforming chemically competent cells is provided by Open Wet Ware and can be found here.
Updated Protocol for Transforming Chemically Competent Cells (as of 6/20)
Due to our low yield from our previous transformations and minipreps, we are now using the following protocol.
Thaw cells on ice ( the cells must be kept on ice as much as possible to work properly)
Gently mix approximately 25μL of cells into chilled polypropylene tube (if ligation then 50μL)
Add 1.25μL or less plasmid DNA
Swirl and flick with finger
Heat shock at 42°C for approximately 45 seconds (no shaking)
Put tubes back on ice for 2-5 minutes
Add 900μL of SOC
Gently shake and incubate at 200 rpm for 30-60 minutes at 37°C
Spread on LB plates
Place in 37°C for 14 hours
Tarun's Transformation Protocol (used 6/21)
Warm cells on ice and by holding
Shake cells for several seconds
Place 1μL of DNA on the side of the cell tube
Obtain 25μL of cells
Place cells on the side of the tube where the DNA is and mix by pipettor
When getting cells out of the container, pipette up and down to mix cells before adding to the tube
Flick the tube with a finger to mic and place the tube back on ice
Let the tube sit on ice for 20-30 minutes
Heat shock the cells at 42°C for 40 seconds
Put the cells on ice for 2 minutes
Shake the cells at 37°C for 8 hours
Miniprep Procedures
For this procedure, we used the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit by Qiagen.
Original Miniprep Procedure
Add 1.5mL of overnight culture to a micorcentrifuge tube
Spin for 3 minutes at 800rpm
Decant the supernatant so that the DNA pellet is all that remains
Repeat steps 1-3 three times
Add 250μL of buffer P2 and invert several times to mix (do not allow the solution to sit for more than 5 minutes)
Add 300μL of buffer N3 and immediately invert to mix
Centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 10 minutes
Apply the supernatant to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting
Centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute and discard flow through
Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 500μL buffer PB
Centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute and discard flow through
Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 750μL Buffer PE
Centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute and discard flow through
Centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 1 minute
Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube
Elute the DNA by adding 50μL of Buffer EB to the center of the QIAprep spin column
Let stand for 1 minute
Quantify DNA concentration with nanodrop
Alterations to Miniprep Procedure (as of June 19)
The P2 and N3 steps (steps 5 and 6) were done twice
The final elution (step 16) was completed using 50°C nanopure water
PCR protocol
We used a PCR mastermix provided by 5 Prime . The components of the mastermix are as follows:
Taq DNA Polymerase (62.5 U/ml)
2.5x Taq reaction buffer (with 125 mM KCl, 75 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 4 mM Mg2+, 0.5% Igepal®-CA630)
500 µM each of dNTP
stabilizers
The full manual for the mastermix can be found here . The procedures we used are described below.
Add 1ul of 100-200nM of the foward and reverse primer to a .2ml tube
Add 10-200ng of the template DNA to the .2ml tube
Adjust the final volume to 15μL (for a 25μL reaction) or 30μL (for a 50μL reaction) with nanopure water
Add 10μL (for a 25μL) reaction or 20μL (for a 50μL reaction) of mastermix to a PCR tube
Add the template DNA/primer mix to the PCR tube, close the tube, and mix well. Avoid foaming. If necessary, centrifuge briefly and place the tube on ice.
Cycle:
95°C for 1-5minutes (usually 4min)
95°C for 1min
55°C for 1min. Cycle 30 times
72°C for 1.5 to 2min (usually 2min)
72°C for 10min
4°C hold

20 μL 2 U/μL Phusion DNA Pol
0.16 μL 40 000 U/μL Taq DNA Ligase
860 μL ddH2O
1.2 ml Total
Prather Recipe 5x Isothermal Reaction Mix:
3 ml 1 M Tris-Hcl (pH 7.5)
300 μL 1 M MgCl2
60 μL 100 mM dGTP
60 μL 100 mM dATP
60 μL 100 mM dTTP

6 ml Total
Store the master mix in 15 ul aliquots at -20 °C. Then:
PCR up your fragments of choice and gel purify
Thaw a 15 μl assembly mixture aliquot and keep on ice until ready to be used.
Add 5 μl of DNA to be assembled to the master mixture. The DNA should be in equimolar amounts. Use 10-100 ng of each ~6 kb DNA fragment. For larger DNA segments, increasingly proportionate amounts of DNA should be added (e.g. 250 ng of each 150 kb DNA segment).
Incubate at 50 °C for 15 to 60 min (60 min is optimal).
Transform as usual
The protocol for Gibson assembly is provided by Open Wet Ware The original paper for the Gibson assembly protocol can be found here
Silica Creation
Obtain 14.4g of nanopure water
Obtain 50µL of .04M HCL and combine it with the water. Put this solution in an ice bath
Obtain 7.6g of tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) in a separate container
Combine the TMOS and HCL/water
Immediately begin the vortex the solution. The solution will be cloudy while the reaction is taking place. Once the solution is clear again, the reaction is finished. This will take approximately 5 minutes
When the reaction is finished, let the solution set for 1-2 minutes
Use a rotary evaporator at 47ºC to remove the methane from the solution. This should take 2-3 minutes. The final  solution volume should be approximately 13mL
If the silica is to be used immediately, put it on ice. It can be stored for up to a week if it is refrigerated.
Filter the silica before use
The procedures are provided by Rickus lab group.
Growth Rate Assay
Measure out 5mL of SOB media into 7 culture tubes

Static Biofilm Assay
Grow the E.coli to stationary phase
Dilute bacteria to 1:100 with SOB media
Place 200uL of the culture samples in each well making sure to do triplicates of each dilution and a control well
