 Sean gave a presentation to the Bio Builder participants on 3A and Gibson assembly
 Sean lead a 3A assembly lab with the participants
 Worked on designing primers </H5><H2> Thursday, June 7 </H2><H5> Continued to design primers </H5><H2> Monday, June 11 </H2><H5> We attempted to optimize our primers using online guidlines and software. </H5><UL><LI><A href="http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/genweb/molecular/seq_anal/primer_design/primer_design.htm">Here</A> is a website that details primer design. </LI><LI>We used a <A href="http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/tech_reference/TmCalc/Default.asp">calculator</A> and an <A href="http://www.idtdna.com/analyzer/Applications/OligoAnalyzer/">Oligo Analyzer</A> which can calculate the liklihood of occurances such as hairpins and dimers. </LI></UL><H5>
 Upon analysis, we found that the primers that would be required to use Gibson assembly were not ideal. In some cases, the forward and the reverse primers did not have Tm values that were close enough to each other. We also had difficulty with making our primers a reasonable length. Furthermore, many of the primers had a high probability (Gibson free energy value lower than zero) of froming dimers or hairpins. Finally, we deicided that it would most likely be more successful to use 3A assembly instead of Gibson.
 In order to save time and ensure the accuracy of the sequence, we decided to synthesize instead of assemble the whole silica making device in a high copy plasmid.
 Welcomed Rubeena to the iGEM team. We are looking forward to working with her! </H5><H2> Tuesday, June 12 </H2><H5> insert meeting minutes </H5><H2> Wednesday, June 13 </H2><H5> August, Mrudula, and Rachel were trained on how to use the flow cytometer
 Made competent cells (DH5α). The protocol for making competent cells is found <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Help:Protocols/Competent_Cells">here</A></H5><H2> Thursday, June 14 </H2><H5>Rachel had a demonstration on how to make silica. The procedure is shown <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Purdue/Protocol#Silica">here</A>.
We welcomed Chris to the iGEM team. We know he will be a great asset to the team!
We had an overview meeting for Rubeena and Chris to help them catch up on the project. </H5><H2> Friday, June 15 </H2><H5> We transformed all of the parts needed for the adhesion device. These included the following </H5><UL><LI> AIDA-1 (BBa_K257018) </LI><LI> Plasmid (pSB1AK3) </LI><LI> pTet (BBa_R0040) </LI><LI> RBS (BBa_B0034) </LI><LI> Terminator (BBa_B0015) </LI><LI> Plasmid (pSB1AC3) </LI><LI> CFP (BBa_E0020) </LI></UL><H5><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2012/0/0d/June_15.ppt">Here</A> is a powerpoint summarizing our team meeting. </H5><H2> Saturday, June 16 </H2><H5> Removed the following parts from the incubator and placed in the refrigerator with parafilm wax </H5><UL><LI> BBa_E00032 (GFP device from plates) </LI><LI> Bba_ </LI></UL><H2> Sunday, June 17 </H2><H5> We reevaluated our previous decision to synthesize the silica making device. We have now decided to use Gibson assembly to create the OmpA-silicatein fusion sequence and 3A assembly for the rest of the device. We believe that this will save money and, considering the time taken to order and deliver the sequence, will not take any more time than synthesizing. </H5><H2> Monday, June 18 </H2><H5> Completed <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Purdue/Protocol#Miniprep">minipreps</A> on recently transformed parts. The results are shown below. </H5><UL><LI> GFP: 17.5ng/μL and 7.6 ng/μL </LI><LI> AIDA-1: 8.7ng/μL and 6ng/μL </LI><LI> pSB1AC3: 5.2ng/μL snd 4.2ng/μL </LI><LI> CFP: 13.6ng/μL and 12.7ng/μL </LI><LI> RBS (BBa_B0032): 24.9ng/μL and 24.2ng/μL </LI><LI> PoPs: 107.8ng/μL and 131.4ng/μL </LI><LI> pSB1AK3: 7.0ng/μL </LI><LI> Terminator: 11.5ng/μL </LI><LI> RBS (BBa_B0034): 21.0ng/μL and 21.5ng/μL </LI><LI> pTet: 5.2ng/μL </LI></UL><H5> These concentrations are too low to proceed with 3A assembly. Therefore, we are going to grow more of the transformed bacteria, and we are going to perform more minipreps. </H5><H2> Tuesday, June 19 </H2><H5> August completed a second round of <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Purdue/Protocol#Miniprep">minipreps</A>. The results are listed below. </H5><UL><LI> RBS (BBa_B0034): 14.8ng/μL </LI><LI> RBS (BBa_C0040): 5.0ng/μL </LI><LI> CFP: 9.0ng/μL </LI><LI> PoPs: 14.9ng/μL </LI><LI> AIDA-1: 7.0ng/μL </LI></UL><H5><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2012/6/6d/June_19.ppt">Here</A> is a powerpoint summarizing our team meeting. </H5><H2> Wednesday, June 20 </H2><H5> Due to the low yields from our previous tranformations and minipreps, we have decided to attempt our transformations with a new protocol. The new protocol can be found <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Purdue/Protocol#UpdatedTransformation">here</A></H5><H5> Today, we transformed pLac, TetR, terminator (BBa_B0015), RBS (BBa_B0034), pSB1A3, and pSB1C3. </H5><H5> The minipreps gave the following results </H5><OL><LI> RBS: 14.8ng/μL </LI><LI> TetR: 5.0ng/μL </LI><LI> CFP: 9.0ng/μL </LI><LI> PoPs: 14.5ng/μL </LI><LI> AIDA-1: 7.0ng/μL </LI></OL><H2> Thursday, June 21 </H2><H5> Due to the low yield of our transformations and minipreps, we have now decided to troubleshoot our transformation procedures. To do this, we will be doing a transformation with Tarun, a graduate mentor to the team. We will be using Tarun's procedures and supplies. We will also have a control plate that will contain cells that had no DNA inserted. If these transformations succeed, then we will have narrowed the possibilities of what went wrong with our procedures. Tarun's transformation procedure can be found on the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Purdue/Protocol#Tarun">here</A>. We performed these test transformations with BBa_I13602 (CFP). </H5>

Upon closer inspection of the AIDA-1 biobrick (BBa_K257018), we have found the following problems
<UL><LI> the sequencing is bad </LI><UL><LI> there are large gaps from the sequencing as compared to what was documented. Specifically, the sequenced biobrick was missing approximately 500bp </LI><LI> the sequence was supposed to be 1326bp long. We have decided that it would cost too much to have the biobrick sequenced ourselves </LI></UL><LI> the gel is bad </LI></UL>
For the above reasons, we have decided to not use AIDA-1. After reevaluating the other adhesion options, we have decided to use Curli (BBa_342003). Due to its inconsistant sequencing, we have decided to have the part found in the kit sequenced ourselves. 

<H2> Friday, June 22 </H2><H5> Due to our increasing size, we have decided to divide into committees. These committees will help us divide the workload fairly and ensure that all tasks are being completed in a timely manner. The committees and their members are listed below.

</UL></UL><H5> We checked our test transformations from yesterday. None of the plates showed growth.</H5><H5><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2012/1/1d/June_22.ppt">Here</A> is a powerpoint summarizing our team meeting. </H5><H2> Monday, June 25 </H2><H5> The foci of this week are to troubleshoot our transformations and research ways to characterize our constructs once they are assembled. August and Mrudula will be in lab troubleshooting. Amanda and Mrudula will be resarching ways to characterize a biofilm. Rachel will be researching ways to characterize a silica coat. </H5><H2> Tuesday, June 26 </H2><H5><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2012/8/85/June_26.ppt">Here</A> is a powerpoint summarizing our team meeting. </H5><H2> Friday, June 29 </H2><H5> We went to Dow Agro, one of our sponsors, to give them an overview of our project. The powerpoint presentation we gave can be found  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=DowPresentation.pptx">Powerpoint</A>. After we gave our presentation, we asked the Dow representative, Ryan, if he had any guidance with concern to Gibson assembly. </H5><H2> Saturday, June 30 </H2><H5> Part of the team volunteered at the high school Jamboree. We saw many amazing teams with remarkable ideas! Congratulations to all the teams for their hard work over the past semester, and good luck as future iGEMers! </H5><H2> Sunday, July 1 </H2><H5> We attempted another test <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Purdue/Protocol#Tarun">transformation</A>, this time using bought Excel 10β competent cells. We had both a negative and positive control. We also plated different concentrations of the final solution to see if we were over or under plating. We also used agar plates with ampicillin that Tarun made. We used store bought SOC. The part used was BBa_J04450. </H5><H2> Monday, July 2 </H2><H5> The tranformations performed yesterday were successful. Both the positive control and the plaes with our part showed growth. The transformation efficiency was extremely high. We got single colonies on the plates with 50μL and overgrowth on the plates that had 150μL. We will only plate at 50μL from now on. </H5><H5> Due to time constraints, we have decided to synthesize both of our constructs. In parallel to characterization of the synthesized constructs, we are going to assemble both constructs using Gibson assembly. The assembles constructs will differ from the synthesized constructs in that the promoter will be a PoPs device and there will be a fluorescent protein on each. In this way, we can find if the addition of these two characterization parts will affect the functionality of our constructs. </H5><H5>The synthesized constructs were ordered from <A href="https://www.dna20.com/">DNA 2.0</A>. Pictures of the Gene Designer (DNA 2.0 software) renditions of the three constructs are given below.</H5><UL><LI><A href="https://2012.igem.org/File:OmpA-Silicatein.jpeg">Silicatein construct</A></LI><LI><A href="https://2012.igem.org/File:Curli_without_GFP.jpg">Curli</A></LI></UL><H5> We transformed Curli so that we can have it sequenced soon </H5><H2> Tuesday, July 3 </H2><H5> We are now awaiting the delivery of our synthesized constructs. In preparation, we are researching the varying types of assays that we may be able to use. You can find information about the different assays we researched can be found <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Purdue/Characterization">here</A>. </H5><H5> Silicatein-Alpha Characterization </H5>
We have decided to use scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and a live dead assay (specifically, the <A href="http://products.invitrogen.com/ivgn/product/L7012?ICID=search-product">Baclight Bacterial Viability Kit</A> from Invitrogen). 

Further assays will be done once the two constructs are used within the same bacteria.

<H2> Friday, July 6 </H2><H5><A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2012/7/72/July_6.ppt">Here</A> is a powerpoint summarizing our team meeting. </H5><H2> Wednesday, July 11 </H2><H5> Chris T created primers for a test Gibson reaction. The test construct will be a the plasmid pGA3K3, PoPs device (BBa_F2620), an RFP with RBS(BBa_K093005), and a double terminator (BBa_B0014).
