Meeting 7/2/12
List of What Needs to get Done this Week:
Research protocols on setting up and running experiments using biofilms
Research flow and static protocols for biofilms
Research ways to characterize silica matrix and acquire quantifiable data
Create timelines for each assay researched
Order reagents and get training on any equipment needed for assays
7/3/12
Researched stages of biofilm formation:
1. Initial Attachment  -  attachment occurs via van der waals forces
2. Irreversible Attachment  -  this is where the EPS forms
3. Maturation I  -  matrix formed with adhesion proteins
4. Maturation II  -  the full biofilm forms
5. Dispersion  -  bacteria released
Also researched shear stress modeling, chassis development, microsensors, and confocal microscopy assays.
7/5/12
Researched possible competitors in the field of bioreactor filtration.
Hydro Engineering - produces "Hydrokleen", which is a bioreactor filtration system that would generally be used in industrial plants and acts as a water recycler.
Seven Trent Services - produces Tetra Amphidrone fixed sequencing Batch Biological Filter, a waste water treatment process that uses a biological filter to remove various pollutants
Kinetics -  this company makes a range of water treatment processes and machines that can be used in industry as well as consumer markets
ABEC - produces bioreactors, but could not find more detail into what kind
7/8/12
Performed a cell culture to have competent cells for a biofilm culture.
Also did research into developing a static biofilm assay to test how well our bacteria makes biofilm before and after our transformation. "Growing and Analyzing Static Biofilms" by Judisth H. Mernitt, Daniel E. Kadouri, and George A. O'Toole was helpful in determining how we would do this assay.
7/9/12
Performed the Gorwth Rate Assay on NEB Beta and DH5 Alpha E.coli strains to determine the time frame we will use to grow our static biofilms.
To the left is the results of the growth rate assay for NEB Beta and DH5 alpha. Overall, the plots show the expected shape with a lag, log, and stationary phase.
Also worked out the lab plan for the rest of the week.
7/10/12
We did the same Gorwth Rate Assay as yesterday, but with the XL-10 Gold E.coli strain because we think it will work better for the biofilm purposes.
Here is the excel file containing all of the data from the three growth rate assays.
Also researched and developed the static biofilm assay that we can do to determine the biofilm rates of our non-transformed E.coli.
7/13/12
Performed the Static Biofilm Assay .
Had a team meeting, discussed goals for the following week:
Write out protocols and email them to the entire team for revisions
Plan a meeting to go through and troubleshoot the protocols together
Find a way to determine the optimized concentration of curli
Purchase all materials needed for future protocols
7/16/12
Researched how Membrane Aerated Bioreactor work and how we will use one for testing.
Silica Characterization
Research was done on different ways to characterize the silica coat. Three extremely helpful articles are listed below.
Cell-Mediated Deposition of Porous Silica on Bacterial Biofilms
Sol-gel synthsis and structure of silica hybrid materials
Thin-film silica sol-gel coatings for neural microelectrodes
A powerpoint highlighting possible characterization methods is given here
After discussion with the team and our faculty advisor, Dr. Rickus, we have decided to use the scanning eletron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and a live/dead assay (specifically, the Baclight Bacterial Viability Kit ).
