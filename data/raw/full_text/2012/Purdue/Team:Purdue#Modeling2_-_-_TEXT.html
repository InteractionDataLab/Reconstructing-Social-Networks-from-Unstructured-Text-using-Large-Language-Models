Equations
The growth of the Biofilm can be modeled with modified continuous growth models. Traditional models of population growth make use of basic differential equations to measure the change in population over unit time. At the most fundamental level
Population Change Rate =
dN
= bN-dN
dt
Where N is the population of individuals, b is the rate of births or immigration, and d is the rate of deaths or emigration.
To understand these dynamics of population in the context of biofilm growth, we treat the bacterial attachment and detachment as a reversible reaction of the form
N Bacteria Attached <
k1
>  N Bacteria Detached
k2
Where k1 is the rate constant of detachment and k2 is the rate constant of attachment. Because we have chosen to simplfily the cell attachment and detachment as a reaction, we are able to employ reaction kinects to predict the rate of binding that will dictate the constants to population growth.
Such assumptions allow us to make use of basic principles of reaction kinetics such as the Law of Mass Action , which dictates that a rate of reaction is always proportional to the concentration of its reactions. Therefore, using the attached and detached cells as the reactants in the equation the rate of attachment becomes
Rate of Growth of Attached Bacteria  =
dNatt
= k2Ndet + βNdet - k1Natt - αNatt
dt
introducing the constants α, which is degredation and dilution, and β, which is reproduction rate.
