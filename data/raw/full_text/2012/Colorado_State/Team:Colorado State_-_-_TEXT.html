Our Gluten-Free Mission
If you have Celiac Disease or are Gluten-Intolerant (and are over 21), stop what you are doing right now. Your prayers for a great tasting gluten-free beer have finally been answered, or at least are in the process of being answered. Think of it as a delay in the mailroom. All of those nights when your friends were taunting you with the ice cold, delicious, golden liquid that gives courage to even the most faint of heart are quickly coming to an end. Your desire to enjoy a "cold one" without having a gut-wrenching reaction should be fullfilled by the end of the summer. The CSU iGEM team is working on producing a "gluten-free" beer that can be brewed from wheat or barley so you can savor that same great taste you know and love. So cross your fingers, bust out your lucky rabbits foot, and watch out for black cats because we are gearing up for something big, and it has never been done before.
More Than a Great Beer
A gluten-free beer isn't the only thing we are working on. We are also designing primers for New Belgium Brewery, developing a novel gluten-detecting assay, and creating a computer-modeled simulation for the breakdown of gluten in beer. All of these various components have us teaming up with some of the best in the business, so don't forget to visit our sponsor and attribution pages.
RamStrong
We proudly roam the steepest and most treacherous mountain sides, looking for adventure, and exploring whatever comes our way. We do not back down from challenges, instead we charge them head on. Although we do occasionally clash heads, we power through our disagreements, because... we are the CSU Rams!!!
