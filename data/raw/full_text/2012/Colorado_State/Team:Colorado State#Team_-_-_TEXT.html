Meet the Team
Steven Denham
The Houdini of the lab, Steven can do things with a pipettor that will have you wondering where you are and what just happened. And as though that isn't enough, he's a research genius. He makes Post-Docs look like High School Freshman.
Dave Packard
Math Wizard, Code Genius, Racquet Sports Pro... We call him a lot of things, but he prefers Dave.
Guy Stewart
He claims he's just a regular guy, but we don't believe him. Guy is the embodiment of natural biology and you can expect to see him on the cover of Home Brewer magazine any day now.
Ethan Ho
A young up-and-coming tech expert, Ethan has been writing code since you were in diapers. You can expect big things from this kid. Before you know it, he'll have us all saying Mark Zucker...WHO?
Ryan Clouse
Ryan who?  This guy showed up by noon if we were lucky.  Strangely he was always on time for our brewery tours.  Passionate about beers, Ryan will be our guinea pig if we ever go to clinical trials with our synthetic yeast.
