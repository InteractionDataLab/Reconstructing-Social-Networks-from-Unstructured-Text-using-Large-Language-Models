Meet the Instructors
Brian Searcy
​You name it, he's lived there. Our coach and mentor is a Renaissance Man of the biology world. If you have a question, he has an answer, and boy did that come in handy.
Chris Strickland
Chris' math and coding knowledge are exceeded only by his love for modeling. He's modeled ideas that haven't even been thought up yet. It's like inception, but with modeling.
