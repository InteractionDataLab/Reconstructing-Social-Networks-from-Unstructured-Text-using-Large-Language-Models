Lucas Argueso
If there was a word for someone who knew everything about yeast, that word would be Lucas. Dr. Argueso is nothing short of a miracle worker when it comes to yeast biology and he's not afraid to prove it.
Brian Geiss
Dr. Geiss is a biology ninja. He can scale mental walls, quietly evade less-than-intelligent questions, and can kill bad ideas with one swift stroke. He is wise beyond his years and has a sweet lab to boot, which is why some of us spent more time in his lab than in ours.
Carol Wilusz
Dr. Wilusz has sharp tools and an even sharper mind. She is known around the Biology building as "the Human Scalpel." She has the ability to take even the most crude projects and make them gems. Her wealth of knowledge and expansive lab proved an unparalleled resource.
