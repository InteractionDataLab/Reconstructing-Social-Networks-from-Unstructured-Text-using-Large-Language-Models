1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
- researcher safety,
- public safety, or
- environmental safety?
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
- did you document these issues in the Registry?
- how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
- how could other teams learn from your experience?
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
- If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?
- If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
-Pure Software Based Project-
Based on our Software project we don't have any kind of safety issues with our project.
UTP Biosafety Group Opinion
The local Biosafety group of our university (create recently), consider our project, specially Biosinergia Project a good tool to the field of Bioenergy Production.
