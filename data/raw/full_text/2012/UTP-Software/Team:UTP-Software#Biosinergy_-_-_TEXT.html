What is BIOSINERGIA? A Biological database, that describes a biobrick™ and metabolic pathways information for energy production.  Introduction:  Our goal is to develop a friendly user program on which the user itself will just introduce the substrate and the bio-fuels he wants, and the program will give him all the possible routes that will led him to the biobrick needed for that specific purpose. Our team is aiming to keep thing simple so the person who makes use of the program just have the preoccupation of introducing the substrate and the kind of energy, the rest is our business. Objectives: To Promote the international collaboration and at the same time a never ending growing database of information on the enormous field metabolic pathways, genes and biobrick™ focused on the energy production. All of these being possible by integrating the mutual collaboration of users and developers and adding new biobrick™, metabolic pathways and genes to the database
How does it work?
W/out Biosinergia:
Substrate--- Met. Pathway --- Biofuel
With Biosinergia:
Substrate----Biobrick---Biofuel
Implementation:  Our team realizes that a storage capability needed for the huge quantity of metabolic pathways, we would be talking of some titanic proportions of space and at the same time being able of implementing “searching algorithms” of the same proportion would have been 2 huge obstacles for our project development.  This is why we choose to use as support the GISELA platform (Grid Initiatives for e-science virtual communities in Europe and Latin America) through the http://www.cidetys.org.pa of the Panamanian government.
First thing First… We are currently learning about the platform GISELA, how the read the metabolic pathways sequence,  the platform structure and everything we need, so we can take as much advantage as possible with the main goal of finally being able to implement our Biological database.
