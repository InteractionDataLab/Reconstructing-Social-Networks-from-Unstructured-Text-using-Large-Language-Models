The transformation from yesterday was successful. We put K414007 into the -20Â°C freezer. The primers for the following BioBricks we intend to make as part of our constructs were designed: Kozak, HSP18.2 terminator, PHT1;2 promoter, Extensin signal, AtPAP15, and PhyA1 (which has two exons, and therefore, four primers needed). We also miniprepped the K382024 terminator, and made a long-term stock as well as a lab stock.</LI></UL><DIV id="june4"><H4>Â  June 4</H4></DIV><UL class="list"><LI>The BioBrick K414007 was grown up so that it was possible to make a long-term stock. We did so by inoculating a colony on an LB and chloramphenicol plate. Our competent cells from June 1 were tested by transforming K414007. A restriction digest was run on K382024 using EcoR1 (E) and Spe1 (S).</LI></UL><DIV id="june5"><H4>Â  June 5</H4></DIV><UL class="list"><LI> K414007 was miniprepped and a long-term stock was made by suspension in 1000ÂµL 40% glycerol and placed in the -80Â°C. The nanodrop showed densities for K414007 of 78 and 100 ng/ÂµL. As a test for competency, the newly-made competent DH5Î± was transformed successfully. We now have a stock of 49 aliquots in the -80Â°C. The chemical cupboard in the lab was also organised.</LI></UL><DIV id="june7"><H4>Â  June 7</H4></DIV><UL class="list"><LI> A 20% SDS solution was made for DNA isolation next week, and PCR primer designs were finalised.</LI></UL><DIV id="june8"><H4>Â  June 8</H4></DIV><UL class="list"><LI> The PCR primers were ordered â desalted, 25 nmole, with no 5' or 3' modifications. The following four strains of Aspergillus from Sporometrics: (i) SCCM# 11-B5 A. niger (Sporometrics Internal QC); (ii) SCCM# 15-E9 A. brasiliensis (Environmentally acquired); (iii) SCCM# 17-B6 A. niger (Environmentally acquired); and (iv) SCCM# 11-B6 A. niger (Sporometrics Internal QC). </LI><LI> Made LB agar, into which we added kanamycin from old stock we found in the chemical storage cupboard and was more effective than the stock we bought last month. (Remember that the antibiotic solution is added to the LB agar after it is autoclaved, but before it has cooled to solidification) Two plates of each Aspergillus strain were prepared in PD agar in order to make a long-term stock. The plates were left to culture over the weekend at 37Â°C. MS medium was made, and A. thaliana seeds were inoculated on the plates, which were stored in the cold room at 4Â°C. 
</LI></UL><DIV id="june11"><H4>Â  June 11</H4></DIV><UL class="list"><LI> Made a long-term stock of all Aspergillus strains by suspending in 40% glycerol and storing in the -80Â°C.

The fume hood was cleaned, and all the chemicals were organised therein. The K652001 transformation was done with two plasmids (since the BioBrick kit came with two plasmids): one failed, the other did not. As a result, we must send this DNA for sequencing before continuing with PCR on this BioBrick. The D. carota DNA extraction was attempted, but had to be postponed, because the proteinase K stock exploded in the -20Â°C.</LI></UL><DIV id="june13"><H4>Â  June 13</H4></DIV><UL class="list"><LI> Digested and ligated the Kozak sequence and did a transformation.

The June 13 Kozak transformations failed, so another attempt shall be made to remedy this situation.</LI></UL><DIV id="june15"><H4>Â  June 15</H4></DIV><UL class="list"><LI> UTSU was contacted in order to begin the process of cheque re-issue for monies owed to iGEM. The lab bench was re-organised in order to make everything easier to access. The D. carota genomic DNA extraction was completed. A grow-box was made with red and blue LEDs such that the A. thaliana could grow properly under regulated lab conditions. The following solutions were made in the lab: 1L 5M NaCl, 500mL 20% SDS, 500mL 3M NaOAc pH 5.3, 500mL 25mM MgCl2, and 500mL 7.5M NH4OAc. </LI></UL><DIV id="june18"><H4>Â  June 18</H4></DIV><UL class="list"><LI> Another ligation and transformation of the Kozak sequence was attempted.

The two carrot gDNA samples were nanodropped: sample one (1) has a density of 68.4 ng/ÂµL, and sample two (2) has a density of 91.4 ng/ÂµL.  </LI></UL><DIV id="june19"><H4>Â  June 19</H4></DIV><UL class="list"><LI> Got $300 contribution from the Skule Alumni Fund.

This procedure worked, and the carrot DNA samples were run, and DNA presence in the samples was confirmed. The gels were accidentally thrown out after imaging. A gDNA prep of the A. niger was also done, with some modifications from the original protocol. Some A. thaliana were planted in pots from the MS-K plates they were cultured on. They were excised by scalpel and transferred to pots filled with potting soil to an approximate 4&quot; height. The plants were watered with milli-Q.</LI></UL><DIV id="june21"><H4>Â  June 21</H4></DIV><UL class="list"><LI> The shaker was observed to see if its malfunction one week ago was purely by chance; it appeared to be so, and thus, the following five treatments were placed into the shaker for overnight incubation: (i) LB control; (ii) LB, DH5alpha, ampicillin; (iii) LB, DH5alpha, chloramphenicol; (iv) LB chloramphenicol and K652001; and (v) LB ampicillin, and psb1A3. </LI><LI> A 1% agarose gel (made using the 1.2g agarose recipe discussed previously) was made, and the A. niger DNA prep was run. The gel was inconclusive, and must be run again tomorrow. The DNA primer melting temperatures were determined and posted for the team on Dropbox. A 100x Antibiotic-antimycotic solution, composed of amphotericin B, streptomycin, and penicillin was bought for use on the potted plants. The solution was aliquoted into 15mL Sarstedt tubes, placed in the -20Â°C. A few tubes were thawed, diluted ten-fold, and transferred to a spray bottle. The solution will be sprayed on twice weekly henceforth.

The samples were stored in elution buffer (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) in the 4Â°C. A shortage of QIAprep Mini Columns was discovered in the lab, rendering these minipreps more time-consuming than usual. The first successful (out of seven previous attempted) gel was run on the a. niger gDNA. </LI></UL><DIV id="june25"><H4>Â  June 25</H4></DIV><UL class="list"><LI> The day was devoted to running a PCR cycle in order to isolate the carrot extensin gene.
