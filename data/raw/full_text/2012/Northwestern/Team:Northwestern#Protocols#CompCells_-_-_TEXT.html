Solutions:
SOB
CCMB80 (Ion Solution)
Magnesium chloride
Procedure
Grow Cells Overnight
Start with Top 10 Cells (from Culture) and Grow
Take single colony from plate, and swirl in ~5mL of SOB in overnight tube
Grow the Cells in shaker (200rpm @ 37C) for ~16 hours
Preparing Solution
Aliquot 100mL of SOB into an Erlenmeyer Flask
Add .5mL of 2M magnesium chloride (MgCl2)
Autoclave
Rinse flask with water for ~1minute to cool
Add 1mL of overnight SOB + cell solution
Put into shaker (200rpm @ 37C) for 2 hours
Measuring Optical Density (OD)
Turn on the spectrophotometer
When ready to measure optical density, blank with regular SOB solution
Get cuvettes ready
At 2 hours measure the OD
Continue to measure the OD every 20-30 minutes until it reaches .35
Note: This growth is exponential, so be quick if close to .35
If it exceeds .4, discard solution and start over
Centrifuging the Cells
When the solution has an OD between .35 and .4
Split into chilled 50mL centrifuge tubes and put on ice for 10 minutes
Have centrifuge tubes chilled in -20C freezer before-hand
Centrifuge for 10 minutes (4000rpm @ 4C)
Make sure to have a pellet at the bottom of the tube
Decant the supernatant and leave upside down on paper towel for a minute
Resuspend the pellet in 30mL of CCMB80 solution
Have the CCMB80 solution ice cold before this
Gently do this by swishing up and down in transfer pipet
This may take upwards of 10 minutes, be patient
Decant the supernatant and leave upside down on paper towel for a minute
Resuspend the pellet in 2mL of CCMB80 solution
Add the solution and just shake the tube to resuspend
Putting the Cells on Ice
Aliquot the total solution into microcentrifuge tubes
Try to break it up into smaller amounts in many microcentrifuge tubes
Place the microcentrifuge tubes into the -80C freezer for later use
