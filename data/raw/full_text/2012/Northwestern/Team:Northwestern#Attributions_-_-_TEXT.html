We would like to thank all of the sponsors here for their support in the form of materials, without which we would not be able to participate or produce a successful project!

We would like to thank Weinberg College of Arts and Science for providing lab facilities within the Department of Biological Sciences and Weinberg student stipends through the Undergraduate Research Office.
We would like to thank the McCormick School of Engineering for the Murphy Grant, which funds went toward McCormick student stipends and lab supply purchases.
