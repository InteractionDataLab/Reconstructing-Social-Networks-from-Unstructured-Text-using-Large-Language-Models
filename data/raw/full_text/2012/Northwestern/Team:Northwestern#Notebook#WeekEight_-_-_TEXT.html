Week Eight - 5 August to 11 August
Sunday
Lajja and Mike performed PCR on Bacillus and Citrobactor. They then ran a gel of the samples.
Monday
Sarah, Tae and Lajja made a stock solution of Chloramphenicol since tetracycline does not seem to be working as hoped. Chloramphenicol plates were also made.
Yuan and Grant PCR purified the Bacillus and Citrobactor following the usual protocol
The lab PCR’d out the amp backbone using the linearized plasmid backbone protocol
Pbad and citrobacter were digested according to the usual protocol
6.29 uL of 79.5 ng/uL of Pbad
36.2 uL water
14.04 uL of 35.6 ng/uL of Citrobacter
28.5 uL water
Sarah, Tae and Lajja prepared and ran a gel for analysis. The gel contained the digested Pbad and citrobacter parts. After analysis, the Pbad and citrobacter parts did not appear on the gel as expected so a redo of the gel should be done tomorrow.
Tuesday
Brian transformed pSB1C3 RFP plate 1 well 3A, pSB1K3 RFP plate 1  well 5A
Mike and Grant performed a digestion on the pBad promoters, lysis parts, and K backbone according to the usual protocol.
Yuan digested the amp backbone with dpn1 and then PCR purified it following the normal protocol
Yuan performed a ligation of the citrobacter phytase part into the linearized amp plasmid backbone
Wednesday
Brian transformed the following parts:
ligated Citrobacter phytase that is in the pSB1A3 backbone
Strongest RBS http://partsregistry.org/partsdb/get_part.cgi?part=BBa_B0034 (kit plate 1 well 2M)
Strong    RBS: http://partsregistry.org/partsdb/get_part.cgi?part=BBa_B0030 (kit plate 1 well 1H)
Strongest con. pro.: http://partsregistry.org/partsdb/get_part.cgi?part=BBa_J23119 (plate 1 well 18A)
Strong con. pro. : http://partsregistry.org/partsdb/get_part.cgi?part=BBa_J23104 (plate 1 well 18K)
Medium  con. pro. : http://partsregistry.org/partsdb/get_part.cgi?part=BBa_J23110 (plate 1 well 20C) -Not Transformed, removed from plate and frozen
Thursday
Pbad WT 77.5 ng/uL, 12.9  uL DNA, 39.6 uL water
Pbad nWT 92.6 ng/uL, 10.9 uL DNA, 31.7 uL water
Cut both with E and then (E and P) for a diagnostic
Friday August 10th:
Strongest RBS  6.87 uL, 35.63ul water
Strong    RBS: 4.88 uL, 37.62ul water
Strongest con. pro.: 6.24 uL, 36.66ul water
Strong con. pro. : 1.95 uL, 40.55ul water
Chloroamp bb: 2.50 uL, 40ul water
Pbad nbWT: 5.43 uL, 37.07ul water
Friday
Yuan miniprepped the promoters for Grand and Sarah
Grant and Michael PCR’d and PCR Purified the kanamycin and chloramphenicol plasmid backbones
Grant and  Michael ran a gel on the PCR’d plasmid backbones
Yuann overnighted the citrobacter phytase(both a red and a white colony that was grown on amp)
Saturday
Miniprepped the the citrobacter phytase(both the red and white colony)
Yuan eluted with too much solution so she redid the miniprep of the citrobacter
