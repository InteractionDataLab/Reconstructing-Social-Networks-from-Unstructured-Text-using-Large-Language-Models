Bacterial Transformation
This protocol was taken and adapted from the yellow book. The yellow book took this protocol and adapted from GinkgoBioworks BioBrick Assembly Manual.
Prepare
Turn on water bath to 42C
Get Bucket of Ice
Get DNA Plasmids
Thaw the competent cells on ice
Bring bucket of ice to the -80C for this part
Put overnight tubes on ice (# overnight tubes = # transformations)
Preparing DNA plasmids
From iGEM wells
Add 10uL of Nuclease-free water into well
Pipette up and down several times to mix
Let sit for a few minutes
From Amp Resistance stocks
Aliquot 1uL of DNA from stock tube into a different microcentrifuge tube
Put DNA stock tube back into freezer
Add 99uL of sterile water into microcentrifuge tube (concentration 1:100)
Aliquot 1uL of the new mix into a second microcentrifuge tube
Add 9uL of sterile water into second microcentrifuge tube (concentration 1ng/ul)
Procedure
Overnight Tubes (start from here if using hydrated DNA or ligations)
Take 25uL aliquots of cells into the overnight tubes on ice
Add 1uL of DNA to each overnight tube on ice
Inject the DNA into the solution at the bottom
Leave tip in the overnight tube
Let sit for 30 minutes on ice
Heat Shock the Tubes in the Water Bath by placing the tubes in the water bath (42C) for exactly 40 seconds
Place immediately back on ice for 2 minutes
Add 200uL of SOB to each tube
Place into shaker (200rpm @ 37C) for 1 hour.
Plating
Spread cells onto plates
Incubate overnight in the incubator (37C)
