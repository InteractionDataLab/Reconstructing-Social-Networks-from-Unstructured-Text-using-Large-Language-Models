Learn physical and biological background  knowledge.
Write RNAThermo.
2012.8.14
Get ‘1st RNAT + eGFP’ gene from the standard part  BBa_I714891 by a three-round overlapping PCR. The result of the first round is  negative due to insufficient DNA templates.
Prepare for transformation of the standard  part BBa_I714891 to bacteria.
2012.8.15
Transform the BBa_I714891 to the bacteria
Pick single colony of the  bacteria harboring BBa_I714891 plasmid.
2012.8.16
Conduct the first round of overlapping PCR  of the gene ‘1st RNAT + eGFP’.
Culture the bacteria harboring BBa_I714891  plasmid.
2012.8.17
Extract BBa_I714891 plasmid from bacteria.
Digest the obtained BBa_I714891 plasmid  with Pst1 and EcoR1, however the band is unclear.
Take the BBa_I714891 plasmid as template  to do the first round overlapping PCR of the gene ‘1st RNAT + eGFP’.
A gradient of PCR annealing temperatures of  the gene ‘1st RNAT + eGFP’ are tested to find the optimal one.
2012.8.18
Purify product of the first round  overlapping PCR of the gene ‘1st RNAT + eGFP’.
Repeat the PCR and electrophoresis verification  procedure.
2012.8.19
Conduct the second round overlapping PCR of  the gene ‘1st RNAT + eGFP’.
61℃ is proved to be the best PCR annealing  temperature of the gene ‘1st RNAT + eGFP’.
2012.8.20
Conduct the third round overlapping PCR of  the gene ‘1st RNAT + eGFP’ and electrophoresis verification procedure.
2012.8.21-8.22
Purify the product of the third round  overlapping PCR of the gene ‘1st RNAT + eGFP’ by gel extraction.
2012.8.23
Digest the plasmid and the PCR product of  the gene ‘1st RNAT + eGFP’ with EcoR1 and Pst1.
Ligate the two digested DNA.
2012.8.24
Test shows the construction of the plasmid  fail.
Retry the ligation
2012.8.25
Ligation and transformation of ‘the 1st  RNAT + eGFP’ are done.
Replicate pSB1C3 plasmid with the protocol  given by iGEM.
Adapt pET-Duet plasmid as expression  vector instead of pSB1C3.
Prepare for the lysozyme experiment.
Transformation of the pSB1C3 plasmid is  done.
2012.8.26
Pick the single and positive colony of ‘1st  RNAT + eGFP’.
2012.8.27
Get ‘signal peptide + lysozyme’ gene by a  three-round overlapping PCR.
Conduct 1st  and 2nd round of the overlapping PCR of the gene ‘1st  RNAT + signal peptide + lysozyme’.
2012.8.28
Amplify  the PCR product of the gene ‘1st RNAT + signal peptide + lysozyme’.
2012.8.29
Prepare for the in-line probing.
2012.8.30
Conduct the in-line probing.
Prepare for the ‘2nd RNAT +  eGFP’ and ‘3rd RNAT + eGFP’ experiments.
2012.8.31
Learn fluorescence signal detection and RNA in vitro transcription procedure in  the in-line probing method.
Conduct the ‘2nd RNAT + eGFP’  and ‘3rd RNAT + eGFP’ experiments.
2012.9.1
Send the plasmid harboring ‘1st  RNAT + eGFP’ gene for sequencing
