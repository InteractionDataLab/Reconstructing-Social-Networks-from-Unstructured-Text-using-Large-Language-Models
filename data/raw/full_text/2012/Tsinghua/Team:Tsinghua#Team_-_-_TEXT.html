Major Research Fields
The main areas of research are  genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, and systems biology. Currently around functional  genomics bioinformatics and systems biology to conduct basic and applied  research. The research topics include: multi-level study of the molecular  biology of genetic information from the genome to the proteome structure,  function, and systems biology, from molecules to cells, to the comprehensive  analysis of complex diseases research.
 
 
 
 
 
Contribution
Except for the fundamental parts provided  by iGEM, the ideas, designs and experiments were purely original and carried  out by ourselves.
The contribution of host labs mainly  focused on providing us a platform to turn our ideas into reality, with  financial and material support. During the experiment procedure, our advisors  and instructors gave comments and suggestions on the designs, and also helped  us with some detailed experiment tips.
Each member of the Tsinghua iGEM 2012 team  contributed a lot to the whole project, listed as followed:
ZHAO Yu, SUN Yingyuan, SHEN Zhixun, LI  Linxin et al worked hard on the general idea and designs of this project; SUN  Yingyuan, LI Linxin, SHEN Zhixun, SHAO Wen, FAN Yujie, ZHU Mingyuan, LI  Jingyang et al were mainly engaged in experiments; LI Linxin, SHEN Zhixun et al  for establishing the model; ZHAO Yu, SHAO Wen, KANG Shiteng, LI Shenrui et al for  the biosafety part; SHI Xiao, SHI Xiaojing, DAI Chen, ZHAO Yanyan et al contributed  most to human practice and backup for the team; ZHU Meng, ZHANG Xingjian, LI  Jingyang, LI Shenrui, GUO Zehua, KANG Shiteng, SHAO Wen et al for the designs  of wiki, poster, booklet and etc. LIU Yu, GUO Zehua, ZHANG Xingjian et al for the programming of wiki and  websites.
More importantly, besides their main parts,  every team member cooperated and helped each other during the whole procedure.

Kang Shi-Teng, junior year at School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua.
First time for me to join the iGEM team. Though mainly engaged with neurons and
neural network modeling stuff in the lab recently, I regard synthetic biology and iGEM as a
brilliant opportunity to apply those learned from courses, to acquire some lab skills
as well to develop a better mind for science, and more importantly, to work in a team and have fun.
