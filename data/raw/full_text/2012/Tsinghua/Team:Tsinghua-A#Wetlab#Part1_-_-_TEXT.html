Construction in Prokaryotic cells
In prokaryotic cells, the system consists of three circuits. One induces flip, one flips and the other expresses. According to the properties of the promoter pBAD, we build the first circuit, using arabinose as an inducement to generate the recombinase Cre. After the content of Cre increasing, loxP sites flip, causing the expression of supD tRNA and T7ptag. T7ptag and supD tRNA act as an AND gate which can active T7 promoter by (iGEM 2009 PKU_Beijing.) Details and truth tables are as follows.
