2012 iGEM Parts by Tsinghua
 
1.Plac-LuxR-Plux
BBa_K766001
There is something wrong with the  previous part BBa_J09855, which doesn't work well. After we sequenced the part,  we find that the sequence of Plac promoter and Plux promoter is incorrect. So  that we rebuild this part using overlap PCR and DNA systhesis. Finally, our  part can work normally.
2.RFP with RBS and T1 terminator
BBa_K766002
We build this part as a reporter to  detect the activation of upstream promoter. This fluorescence protein is very  easily detectable even by eyes. Besides, we have added a strong RBS and T1  terminator to the end. You can use this part to construct a more complicated  part further more.
3. C6HSL sensor and reporter
BBa_K766003
We  build this part to work as a receiver. C6HSL from the neighbor cell can diffuse  across the membrane and activate the transcription from Plux promoter. There is  something wrong with original Part:BBa_J09855. So we rebuild the reporter part  which can be activated by AHL and add the reporter part RFP which is easily  detectable. The expression of it is very clear.
 
4. His-Tag-LuxI without LVA-tag
BBa_K766000
This  part is a protein coding sequence which encodes a LuxI protein without LVA-tag  and added a His-tag at the amino terminus. As a result, not only can this LuxI  be degraded at a shorter time but it can be purified by affinity  chromatography.
 
 
5. T7 promoter-His tag-LuxI
BBa_K766005
We build this part to work as the  signal sender in our project. T7 promoter is a high-efficient promoter which  can bind with T7 polymerase and start the transcription. Besides, we add the  lac operator between T7 promoter and CDS. If you use this part in a luxI-coding  plasmid like pet15b, the expression of gene will be repressed. However, IPTG  can be used to activate the expression. His tag is on the N-terminal, which  consists of six histidine amino acid. We can use Ni-column to purify the  protein. Besides, you can use Hig-tag antibody to detect the protein in western  blot. This design makes the detection of luxI gene become very easy.
 
6. Plux-LacI without LVA-tag
BBa_K766006
         This  device is a protein-expression unit which contains a Plux promoter and a  transcriptional unit of LacI without LVA-tag. Plux can be activated by luxR-AHL  complex and the promoter can activate the expression of downstream genes. We  add LacI in this part. As we all know, LacI is a repressor which can bind with  Lac operator. With the help of this feature, many logic gates or gene  expression modulation can be achieved.
There is not LVA-tag in this part so that  the repressor can keep working for a relatively long time.
 
 
7. Plas/cI hybrid Promoter-RFP
BBa_K766007
This  device is composed of a Plac/cI hybrid promoter and a translational unit of  mRFP. The Plas/cI hybrid promoter is made up of Plas promoter and cI operator. The  promoter can be activated by the LasR-C12HSL complex and repressed by cI  repressor. This part can be used in building some logic gates. The RFP segment  is used as a signal to show the result of activation or repression. This kind  fluorescent protein is very easy to be detected even by eyes.
 
8. AndNot gate based on AHL
BBa_K766004
We design this A and not B gate. This  part is based on the two kinds of AHL：C6HSL (signal A) and C12HSL(signal B). C6HSL can activate the  promoter Plux and C12HSL can activate the promoter Plas. In this part, we add  cI operator downstream of Plas. As a result, the promoter Plas can be activated  by signal B but repressed by cI protein. The expression of cI protein is under  the control of Plux, which can be activated by signal A. RFP is controlled by  Hybrid promoter (Plas and cI operator), which will work as a reporter.
In a word, the expression of RFP is  only on the condition that A is absent and B is present.
