      In addition to exploration, explanation and prediction, the ultimate  goal of science is creation.  In the  field of life science, enthusiasm towards creation originates the synthetic  biology.  During the last decade, numerous  artificial biological networks had been made by rearranging the exited biological  macromolecules.  Recently, creation of the  macromolecules inside biological networks emerges as a hotspot.  Because of structural simplicity and manipulation  convenience, RNA becomes an ideal model for conducting such researches. 
      This year, in iGEM 2012 competition, the first  software that designs temperature-sensing regulatory RNA - RNAThermo is  reported by iGEM Tsinghua-D Team.   Structural and functional verifications of the designed RNATs were  made.  RNAThermo’s potential application  in the fermentation industry is discussed:   the software provides a new method for achieving controlled expression of products in the fermentation industry.
