A more accurate model using Gillespie algorithm
To make the model more convincing, we use Gillespie algorithm, which is a kind of stochastic simulation algorithm to generate a statistically correct trajectory (possible solution) of a stochastic equation.
Summary of the steps to run the algorithm
“Step 0 (Initialization). Input the desired values for the M reaction constants c_1,. . ., c_Mand the N initial molecular population numbers X_1,. . ., X_M. Set the time variable t and the reaction counter n both to zero. Initialize the unit-interval uniform random number generator (URN). Step 1. Calculate and store the M quantities a_1 = h_1 c_1,, . , , a_M = h_M c_M for the current molecular population numbers, where h_v is that function of X_1,. . ., X_M defined in (1). Also calculate and store as a_0 the sum of the M a_v values. Step 2. Generate two random numbers r1 and r2 using the unit-interval uniform random number generator, and calculateτandμaccording to (2) and (3). Step 3. Using theτandμvalues obtained in step 2, increase t byτ, and adjust the molecular population levels to reflect the occurrence of one R_μ, reaction; e.g., if R_μ is the reaction in (4), then increase X_1 by 1 and decrease X_2 by 1. Then increase the reaction counter n by 1 and return to step 1. “(Danlel T. Gillespie, 1977, p. 2345)[7] We define for each reaction R_μ and h_μ according to the equations below.

Simplified summary of the steps to run the algorithm
1. Initialization: Initialize the number of molecules in the system, reactions constants, and random number generators. 2. Monte Carlo step: Generate random numbers to determine the next reaction to occur as well as the time interval. The probability of a given reaction to be chosen is proportional to the number of substrate molecules. 3. Update: Increase the time step by the randomly generated time in Step 2. Update the molecule count based on the reaction that occurred. 4. Iterate: Go back to Step 2 unless the number of reactants is zero or the simulation time has been exceeded.
