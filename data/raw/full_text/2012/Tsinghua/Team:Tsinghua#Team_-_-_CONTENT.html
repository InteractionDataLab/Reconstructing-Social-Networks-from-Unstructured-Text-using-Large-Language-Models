  The contribution of host labs mainly  focused on providing us a platform to turn our ideas into reality, with  financial and material support. During the experiment procedure, our advisors  and instructors gave comments and suggestions on the designs, and also helped  us with some detailed experiment tips. </P><P>Each member of the Tsinghua iGEM 2012 team  contributed a lot to the whole project, listed as followed:
  ZHAO Yu, SUN Yingyuan, SHEN Zhixun, LI  Linxin et al worked hard on the general idea and designs of this project; SUN  Yingyuan, LI Linxin, SHEN Zhixun, SHAO Wen, FAN Yujie, ZHU Mingyuan, LI  Jingyang et al were mainly engaged in experiments; LI Linxin, SHEN Zhixun et al  for establishing the model; ZHAO Yu, SHAO Wen, KANG Shiteng, LI Shenrui et al for  the biosafety part; SHI Xiao, SHI Xiaojing, DAI Chen, ZHAO Yanyan et al contributed  most to human practice and backup for the team; ZHU Meng, ZHANG Xingjian, LI  Jingyang, LI Shenrui, GUO Zehua, KANG Shiteng, SHAO Wen et al for the designs  of wiki, poster, booklet and etc. LIU Yu, GUO Zehua, ZHANG Xingjian <EM>et al </EM>for the programming of wiki and  websites.
