Modelling
The  Domino processing starts with one or more external signal, which is transmitted  and amplified by E.coli population till  finally a computation output obtained. This is accomplished within an intact  biofilm that forms on agar medium plate, a system that comprises  multidimensional features. To illustrate the whole process clear cut through  quantitative analysis, a set of time (t) and space(r) related differential  equations is established to satisfy the mathematical model of Domino E.coli Community.
Time/space related equations of  concentration
In  this case, three particular molecules made by Domino E.coli Community are responsible to fulfill this work: C6HSL  (synthesized by luxI), cI repressor (expression product of cI gene) and C12HSL (synthesized  by lasR), each amount of those is a time and space related function, say, A(r,t), B(r,t), C(r,t).  Due to the diffusible property of small molecules A (C6HSL) and B (C12HSL), the  flux J of each is determined not only by time, but also by gradient of its position  (refer to Fick’s first law). Listed below are the simultaneous differential  equations of the three concentrations.
Equations of biosynthesis and the  matrix expression
Here  we use A, I, C to refer to the amount of AHL, lacI, cI, while mA, mI, mC stand for the mRNA level, respectively. Like  all the rest of living organisms, biosynthesis within Domino E.coli individual is ruled by the  central dogma, the process of transcription and translation. Since biological  macromolecules are often controlled by synthesis and degradation, a set of parameters  are introduced, ki for synthesis rate constant, li for degradation rate constant. Following are  the simultaneous differential equations of key biosynthetic  process in Domino E.coli.
*mRNA  transcription of cI is inhibited by the binding of lacI inhibitor to lacO  operator, thus k5/InI' is preferred rather than k5InI'.
For  conciseness and beauteousness, it can be rewritten into the matrix form:
The  vector function X:
The  domino circuit matrix L:
In  this case, mA and mI are controlled by the same promoter pLux, thus k1=k3.
The  Hill coefficient vector:
Solution to the time related  equations
However, things are more complicated under physical circumstances, AHL  would not increase limitlessly within individual bacteria, mRNA level would  finally reach equilibrium. That’s what Hill coefficient vector deals with. For  convenience of derivation, we might let H=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,1,1], but in practical situation, we have to take  into account that copy number of promoter is limited, and transcriptional  factor binding to promoter could be saturated as well. AHL bound luxR acts as a  transcriptional factor that recovers plux promoter activity from HNS. Let pmax=k1AnA', i.e. plux promoter is fully activated. Although  some of the equations are analytic unsolvable, a software Matlab (ver. 2010b)  is capable of circumvent this through arithmetic solution.
Figure m.1 is arithmetical solved using Matlab,  which suggests a clear positive correlation of lacI and A, controlled by the  same promoter plux. Notice the y axis stands for the relative amount, i.e. the  total amount divided by the saturated amount. Figure m.2, on the other hand, represents  a negative correlation amongst lacI, mRNA of cI and cI. lacI plays a role of  bridge combining A and cI, which exhibits similar synthesis curve with A, and  inhibitory effect on cI.
Spatial  distribution of concentration
Equations of flux describes the transmission rate of signal  molecules (A and B) in spatial dimensions. In the very occasion we consider  situation only in one dimension ,x axis. According to Fick’s second law, the  change of concentration with time is described below.
Circuits  of A and B resemble thus it needs only to examine either of them, and A is preferred  for the reason of inhibitory effect on cI synthesis. The  origin of x axis refers to where the initial signal is received and domino  effect is triggered. Along  with A, cI protein level shifts in the opposite manner: when A is synthesized  and growing up, the already saturated cI starts to degrade with its magnitude  drops down (figure m.3 and figure m.4, plotted using Matlab 2010b).
Hybrid promoter and threshold
plasR/cI Hybrid promoter containing lasR and cI binding site will be activated  when the concentration of signal B(C12HSL) exceeds the threshold and the  expression of cI repressor is below the threshold. As mentioned above, signal A  (C6HSL) and signal B (C12HSL) will rise with time until reach the peak, while  cI repressor decreases all the way, antagonizing but the tendency of A. This  antagonism effect is transmitted away from, considering the simplest situation,  the origin of x axis upon the culture medium, forming a one dimensional wave. Meanwhile,  a second signal B triggers another wave, which leads to no variation of cI  repressor though, moving against forward direction from the terminus of x axis.  When the frontal edges of two waves intersect, a region where B is above the  threshold and cI below its own, could be visualized through the expression of reporter  RFP.
