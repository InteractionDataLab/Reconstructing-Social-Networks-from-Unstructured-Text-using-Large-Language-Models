1 General idea
Tsinghua iGEM 2012 presents the idea of “Domino  Effect in E. coli” as a potential approach to allow a whole E. coli community  to perform exactly the same with only one weak initial signal and carry out  information processing. This goal can be achieved by a set of quorum  sensing-based design, including basic modules of signal reception and release,  signal amplification and complex modules of logic gating. Furthermore, the  population of bacteria community is a huge advantage for information processing  compared to existing single cell-based computing circuitries.
2 Concept
Figure  1A. This figure shows how conventional domino effect
works, as the tile in  front fall, they topple the tiles behind them
as a result – signal transmission  and
Figure 1B. This figure demonstrates our basic  concept of
E. coli dominos, inspired by the conventional domino effect.
 
From the figures above, if we look at it from  another perspective, the domino effect can be viewed as a form of information  processing, with the possibility to realize signal amplification and logic  gating. We attempted to use biological elements to replace the mechanical  elements in mechanical domino effect: each bacterium represents a domino tile; the  action of topple here refers to a set of information transmission process, and  the mechanical force is replaced by chemical signaling molecules; these  elements are the key to building a set of “E. coli dominos”, like the one we  showed in figure 1B.
Quorum sensing in prokaryotes allows bacteria to communicate through  chemical signals like AHLs, and coordinate behaviors among the whole bacterial community.  This mechanism is ideal to serve as a basis  for our project.
In the basic module, a small proportion of E.  coli in the community will receive and recognize an external signal, then send  it forward to bacteria nearby using AHL signals, causing the same reaction in  cells nearby. Since each bacterium may affect tens or even hundreds of  surrounding bacteria, the signal amplifies exponentially. Thus, the signal will  be transmitted and amplified step by step.
As an upgrade of the basic modules, a  multi-signal system is designed, starting with two distinct AHL signals working  independently, so as to achieve the logic gating and calculation functions. Specifically  speaking, distinct information processing functions, or logic gates, such as ‘AND’, ‘AND NOT’, ‘XOR’ can be realized by unique biological circuitries, and  the assembly of these modules shows promise for obtaining complex computation  functions.
Taken together, our project aims to establish a  novel information processing system in bacterial community, based on the logic  of domino effect and quorum sensing system, which possesses the capability of  information transmission, amplification and logic gating.
3 Design
The designs of our project are illustrated as  followed.
3.1 Basic modules
3.1.1 Signal reception and  output:
The basic function of signal reception and  release is realized by a simple pathway including AHL as signal molecule, LuxR  as signal reception part and RFP as a sign of signal reception and subsequent  release. The AHL molecules may come from two sources: external (i.e. AHL solution  we drop into the system) and internal (i.e. AHL from neighboring stimulated  cells).
Here we used two kinds of AHL molecules from  two species, with the same functioning mechanism and no cross-linking: 3OC6HSL  from V. fischeri used in Lux system  and 3OC12HSL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa used in Las system. The binding of AHL to LuxR will form “the dimer of dimer”,  which consists of two AHL molecules and two LuxR protein molecules. This  complex will activate the transcription from the promoter PLuxR, leading to  subsequent expression of RFP. RFP, or other such proteins, serves as an output  of the input information. In this part, two signal pathways using two different  kinds of AHL molecules are constructed.
3.1.2 Signal transmission and  amplification:
One property of quorum sensing signals is that  the chemical molecules are able to freely move across membranes, which is also critical  for our project in the signal transmission module. The concept of positive  feedback is also applied in this module, making it possible to intensify signal  strength and avoid attenuation.
We constructed our own positive feedback loop  in E. coli with several different parts. LuxI, with the function of expressing  AHL synthase, was inserted downstream of RFP in the aforementioned basic  module. Thus, once external AHL is received and RFP expressed, AHL would be  further synthetized in the same bacterium. As a result, AHL molecules  synthesized after RFP could affect the E. coli itself, synthesizing even more  AHLs and completing the positive feedback loop; alternatively, it could travel  across membranes to other bacteria nearby, and start the activation of  identical modules in those cells. In other words, information received by the  initial bacterium is transmitted to its neighbors, and they would respond the  same way and pass the signal on to other cells, just as domino tiles would pass  the mechanical force on to other tiles. Furthermore, the expression of RFP  would spread to the whole community over time, and accumulate in a certain time  period. Both the positive feedback loop and the enormous population of bacteria  could serve for the purpose of signal amplification.
3.2 Complex modules
3.2.1 Logic gate-like  information processing:
When different signals meet in the same cell, the state of the cell would shift from “transmission” to “processing”. The conventional dominoes can be arranged to function as logic gates, which inspires us to design similar information processing circuitries with our system.
Figure2. An abstract of  domino tiles to complete logic gate-like functions, which are also realizable  with our biological system.
Here we designed a simple part to achieve a logic gate-like information processing. When only signal B (3OC12HSL) is present, RFP is expressed and can be seen. But if signal A (3OC6HSL) is added with signal B, cI repressor is expressed and then inhibit the expression of RFP.
 
We also designed a system to accomplish the information processing. In this system, there are some fixed parts such as Plac, Plux, and some alterable parts like R1 to R4 (protein coding genes) and PA, PB (promoters). In order to make one logic gate available, we can just change the R1 to R4 or PA, PB.
When R1, R2, R3, R4 and PA, PB in figure above  represent different protein coding gene or different promoter, as shown in the  table, various logic gates are realized.
3.2.2 Final design
 This complex pathway achieves the 'AND-gate'  mentioned in logic gate design. When there is no signal input, cI is expressed  constantly. If we add only signal B (3OC12HSL, which can activate Plas  promoter), Hybrid promoter Plas/cI is repressed by cI, thus no RFP can be observed.  With only signal A (3OC6HSL, which can activate Plux promoter), Plas/cI  promoter cannot be activated without signal B. When signal A and B are present  together, because of the activation of Plux by signal A, lacI is expressed and will  then inhibit the expression of cI, Plas/cI will be activated by signal B  without cI, then RFP can be seen.
