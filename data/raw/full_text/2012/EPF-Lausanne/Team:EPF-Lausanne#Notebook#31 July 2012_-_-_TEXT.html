Plate with pHY42 transformed bacteria moved to fridge
There are only a couple of visible colonies. It's better than zero!
Overnight culture for miniprep
Protocol: Prepare Plasmid Extraction (culture for Miniprep)
Select and number colonies on the plates.
Prepare tubes of LB medium with the correct quantity of antibiotics (100 µg/ml for Amp, Spc or chloramphenicol).
Amp can be found in the -20ºC freezer at Ecoli, labeled as "stock". It is 100 µg/µl, or 1000x.
The tubes to be used are the 14 ml round bottom found in front of the iGEM drawers (Falcon). Culture with cap in the first step (loose) and close to the second step after culture.
Touch each colony with a clean pipette tip and put it in a tube.
Put in incubator.
Picked up the 4 existing colonies, started overnight cultures in Falcon tubes.
Sequencing
Received sequencing results from Microsynth for pMA-LovTAP (to see if its sequence is still intact, and matches the FASTA sequence we had). It does.
Meeting
Informal meeting in the SV cafeteria among the team, planning for further experiments.
