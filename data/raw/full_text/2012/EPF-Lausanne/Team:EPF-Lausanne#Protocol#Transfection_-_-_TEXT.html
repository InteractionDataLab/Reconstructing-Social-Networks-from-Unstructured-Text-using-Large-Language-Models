Cell Density  3x106cells/mL
Total Volume  5 mL
DNA  1.5 µg/106cells
PEI  3 µg/106cells
Passage seed 1 day prior to transfection
Prepare tubes by addition of DNA
Centrifuge the necessary volume of seed, remove conditioned medium and resuspend in necessary volume of fresh medium to acheive the required cell density
Add 5 mL of the cell suspension to the tube with DNA and mix by orbitally shaking
Add the PEI to the Cell+DNA mixture as soon as possible
