Bioreactor construction
For our project we made a custom illumination device to test different light conditions for LovTap activation and for use with the melanopsin channel pathway.
Testing and programming the arduino
The first step was to get the arduino microcontroller up and running, load some simple programs and test out a few circuits on a breadboard.
Preparing the components
We painted the the part holding the LEDs to prevent light from one row leaking into another.
Soldering and assembly
Testing
The device works!
