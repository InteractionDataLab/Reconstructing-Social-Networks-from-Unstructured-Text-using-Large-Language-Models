Maxiprep
2 maxipreps using 200 ml of LB each, for RO + Spc. and LovTAP + Amp.
In the morning we realized that the bacteria had been overnight at 30.7ºC, so we left them 4 extra hours at 37ºC.
Centrifuge them for 20 min at 4000 rpm, thow away the supernatant and continue with the Maxiprep protocol.
In the last step, centrifuge the Falcon tubes at 4000 rpm, for one hour.
Bring the tubes to hood in the cell lab.
Remove the supernatant with the vacuum pump.
Add 5 ml of ethanol, shake gently, and remove with the vacuum pump. Be careful with the DNA pellet!
Leave the tubes open, at the back of the hood, with the label "DNA drying".
Protocol: None
Forgot to insert protocol.
