Protocol: Agar LB plate preparation
Ingredients:
LB: 20 g/L
Agar: 10 g/L (Note: not agarose)
di water
Procedure:
Autoclave all the ingredients together in a glass bottle, loose cap and covered with alu foil, with 20 min liquid program (106). This takes about 1h in the autoclave.
Prepare the plates by labeling and ethanol cleaning a big enough surface.
Close the bottle and allow to cool down to 50-55ºC (colder will start to solidify, warmer might degrade the antibiotic).
Add the antibiotic to the bottle: 100 µg/ml for ampicillin, 50-100 µg/ml for spectinomycin.
Add 25-30 ml of the medium with antibiotic to each plate. Leave half open for about 2 h for cooling.
Close hte plates. Wrap the in alu foil (antibiotics are sensitive to light) and store the at 4ºC.
