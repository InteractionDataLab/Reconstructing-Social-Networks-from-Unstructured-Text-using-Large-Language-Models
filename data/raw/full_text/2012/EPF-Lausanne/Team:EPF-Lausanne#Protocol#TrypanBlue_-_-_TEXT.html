Take x µL of PBS in a 96-well plate.
Add the required volume of cell culture. Mix once.
Bring the plate back to the microscope, add Trypan Blue to the PBS + cell mixture just before counting the sample.
Trypan Blue is toxic to cells. If left too long with it, even healthy cells will die.
Calculation of LCD :
LCD = Cell Count/(100*4)*Dilution
Tips :
Mix cells before sampling.
Take the cell sample from the top of the liquid.
Mix Trypan Blue in the PBS + cell solution slowly before loading.
