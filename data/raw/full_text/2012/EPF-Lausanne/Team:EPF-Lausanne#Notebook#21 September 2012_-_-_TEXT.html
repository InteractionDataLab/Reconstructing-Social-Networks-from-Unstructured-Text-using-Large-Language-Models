1 CHO and HEK passaging
2 Silver Staining result
2.1 Protocol: Silver Staining
3 Gel making
3.1 Gel Ingredients (choose percentage according to the size of the protein)
CHO and HEK passaging
Made 4 tubes of HEK seed and of CHO seed (each about 1.5 mio/ml) for the Sunday transfection.

Loading Plan
Lane 1: Ladder
Lane 2: Empty well
Lane 3: 10microL of VP16 only
Lane 4: 25microL of VP16 only
Lane 5: Nontransfected CHO cell - High concentration (5million)
Lane 6: Sample 1 48h of expression
Lane 7: Sample 2 48h of expression
Lane 8: Sample 1 72h of expression
Lane 9: Sample 2 72h of expression
Lane 10: Nontransfected CHO cell - Same concentration as samples
Result: The lane 9 (Lovtap-VP16 transfected CHO cell) and lane 10 (non-transfected CHO cell) have intensity difference around 30~35kDa area.

Lane 10: Nontransfected CHO cells - same concentration as samples
Result: Lane 9 (LovTAP-VP16 transfected CHO cell) and lane 10 (non-transfected CHO cells) have a (faint) intensity difference around 30~35kDa area.  This, however, cannot be considered as a significative result.
