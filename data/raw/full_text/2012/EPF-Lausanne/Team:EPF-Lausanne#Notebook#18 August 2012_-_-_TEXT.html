Introduction
Our Project
Notebook
Human Practices
Acknowledgments
Restriction enzymes testing, debugging
Diverse random cuts were performed in order to see whether our enzymes were actually functional. Most of them turned out to be working, so the problems we are having with cloning most likely come from PCR issues.
Sequencing results
Received a working sequencing result for pHY42.
