Protocol: Agar Plates
Add to a bottle:
20 g/l of LB broth powder.
10 g/l of Agar (not agarose).
Fill up with DI water and autoclave (program 106, takes 2 hours). Remember to leave the cap loose!
Label the plates (found in the stock room).
When the autoclaving is done, close the bottle cap and take the bottle out.
Let rest until it cools down to around 55ºC (can be held for some seconds): if warmer, the antibiotic degrades, if colder, the broth gelifies.
Add the antibiotic (Ampicillin 100 µg/ml) = 1 ml of 100 mg/ml Amp for 1l of broth. Same for chloramphenicol or Spe.
Add 25-30 ml of broth to each plate and let open for 2 hours.
Close plates, wrap in alu foil (Amp is sensitive to light) and store at +4ºC.
