SSBE conference
We were kindly invited by Prof.Maerkl (one of our advisors) to participate to the annual meeting of the Swiss Society for Biomedical Engineering (SSBE). We gave a talk there ( download the presentation) and presented a poster (download the poster ). We also met the ETH Zurich team, the other Swiss team, and discussed our respective projects. They also gave a talk.
Overnight culture of pGL4.30 backbone plasmid
Protocol: Prepare Plasmid Extraction (culture for Miniprep)
Select and number colonies on the plates.
Prepare tubes of LB medium with the correct quantity of antibiotics (100 µg/ml for Amp, Spc or chloramphenicol).
Amp can be found in the -20ºC freezer at Ecoli, labeled as "stock". It is 100 µg/µl, or 1000x.
The tubes to be used are the 14 ml round bottom found in front of the iGEM drawers (Falcon). Culture with cap in the first step (loose) and close to the second step after culture.
Touch each colony with a clean pipette tip and put it in a tube.
Put in incubator.
5 colonies picked from old Amp plate and added to tubes with 10 ml of LB-Amp overnight. 10 ml was actually too much.
Bioreactor: plate for light intensity test
24-well plate given to workshop (CHH) to drill the cover with holes for the LEDs and the wells with 12 mm holes.
Bioreactor: cell culture absorbance test
Absorbance of cell cultures checked with Nanodrop.
