Where we're from
Meet the EPFL! Who are we? To cite our university's
propa
information page: "EPFL is Europe’s most cosmopolitan technical university. It receives students, professors and staff from over 120 nationalities. With both a Swiss and international calling, it is therefore guided by a constant wish to open up; its missions of teaching, research and partnership impact various circles: universities and engineering schools, developing and emerging countries, secondary schools and gymnasiums, industry and economy, political circles and the general public." And so is our team (that is, international)! Here are a few pictures:
