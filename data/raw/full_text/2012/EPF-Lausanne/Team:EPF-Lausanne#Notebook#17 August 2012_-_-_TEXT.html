Colony PCR
Protocol: PCR
PCR is a reaction that makes it possible (and relatively easy) to amplify a certain region of DNA. The first step is the selection of that region (and the design of the relevant primers). Primer design can be done by hand, or by using our Primer Design Helper . Once done, order the primers (in our case, we ordered from them IDT ).
When you've received the primers, prepare them and make sure you've got your PCR kit (we used the "Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase"). Start preparing your master mix, the composition for one tube is:
1X Mastermix 20μl reaction, add in this order
Reagent
Volume [μl]
Water
Complete to total volume of 20μl
HF-Buffer (5x)
4
DMSO (optional)
0.6
dNTPs
0.4
Forward primer (50μM)
0.2
Reverse primer (50μM)
0.2
Template (10ng/μl)
0.5
Phusion HF polymerase
0.2
Prepare one or two extra tubes-worth of reagent (you'll use some liquid on the walls of your tips).
Once you've finished, you should run the resulting products on a gel to check if everything went as planned.
Tips
Thaw the HF-Buffer, DMSO and dNTPs before making the mastermix.
Avoid taking the Phusion-HF polymerase out of the freezer (only take it out briefly when you need to add it).
If the reactions have different primers and/or template, add the polymerase right after the dNTPs, split the mastermix and add the rest.
Don't forget positive and negative controls
Primers should have similar Tms (less than 5°C).
Primer Tm calculation is a less exact science than it should be (just test several tools and compare their results). If you're not sure what the correct Tm is, consider using a gradient PCR.
Avoid primers with strong secondary structures.
PCR can introduce mutations. Don't forget to sequence your final product (this could be your final plasmid): you really don't want to lose a few weeks because of a "corrupt" plasmid.
We performed a colony PCR (BM lab) on the colonies that were transformed the previous night.  Each colony was swiped with a clean pipette tip and the tip was rubbed on the bottom of the PCR tube. The tip was then used to streak a plate to conserve the colony for later use.
Colonies were picked as follows:
C1: control pMP
C2-C6: pMP-LovTap (L5 PCR product)
C7-C11: pMP-LovTap (pMA PCR product in HF buffer)
C12-C13: pMP-LovTap (pMA PCR product in GC buffer)
Colonies were streaked on a gridded plate.
We followed standard PCR protocol after this step. A gel was then run.

Comments
No positive results were observed. This leads us to the conclusion that the plasmids that contain LovTAP are probably actually pMA-LovTAP (direct synthesis plasmid that has somehow survive).
