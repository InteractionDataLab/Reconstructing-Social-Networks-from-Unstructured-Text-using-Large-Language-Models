Protocol: Sampling for Tecan Machine
The Tecan plate reader is used to measure fluorescence. It is useful if you want to quantify your fluorescent readout relatively to a baseline. To control it, use the provided Excel utility.
1. Take ~1 million cells in 750 µL PBS.
2. Centrifuge at 450g for 5 min.
3. Remove the supernatant.
4. Resuspend in 200µL of 1% TritonX in PBS.
5. Load onto a black well plate and leave in the shaker for 1h.
6. Read fluorescence on the machine using the appropriate Excel program.
