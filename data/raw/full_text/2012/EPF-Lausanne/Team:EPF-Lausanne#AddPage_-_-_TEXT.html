This page provides some helpers to create new pages (i.e. automatic insertion of the correct templates).
Naming Conventions
To keep the pages easy to find, we'll need to use some naming conventions:
The page name should start with a capitalized letter
Use CamelCase (that is to say, remove all spaces and put the first character of each word in uppercase, for example: "Fictional titles are nice examples" becomes "FictionalTitlesAreNiceExamples"
