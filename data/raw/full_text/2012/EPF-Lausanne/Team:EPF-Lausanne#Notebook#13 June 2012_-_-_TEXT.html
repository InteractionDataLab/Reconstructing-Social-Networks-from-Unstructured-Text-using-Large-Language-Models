DNA digestion
Protocol: Restriction site digestion
Look for the best pair of restriction sites, ideally with similar digestion temperatures and times.
NEBcutter for finding cutting enzymes.
Double Digest Finder for the parameters.
Calculate the amounts required of:
DNA
Buffer (usually from 10x to 1x)
BSA, if needed (usually from 100x to 1x)
Enzymes (depends on the amount of DNA)
Water
Get the recommended buffer (and BSA if needed) from the freezer and let defreeze.
Mix all the ingredients, except DNA, in a tube.
Note: Enzymes should stay no longer than a couple of minutes out of the freezer. Don't touch the bottom of the tubes! Don't vortex!
Distribute the mix in as many tubes as DNA samples and add the DNA.
Keep in the Thermomixer at the recommended temperature.
Sowmya's recommended amounts (50 µl total solution):
5 µl of 10x buffer
0.5 µl of 100x BSA
1 µl of each enzyme
5 µl of DNA
37.5 (up to 50 µl) of water.
Protocol based on what was done on July the 4th .
Enzymes chosen: EcoRI and XbaI
Get from the fridge:
Buffer x10
BSA
Get the 5 DNA tubes from the freezer (discard the one that got a "hard life")
Preheat at 37ºC
Vortex
Centrifuge
In 5 tubes:
3 µl of water
5 µl of BSA
5 µl of DNA
5 µl of Buffer
2 µl of EcoRI
2 µl of XbaI
Vortex
Centrifuge
Leave at 37ºC for 2 hours
Gel electrophoresis
Protocol: Gel Electrophoresis
Agarose concentration depends on the size of the DNA to be run. We will mostly use 1%. VOL is the desired volume of gel in ml:

1kb ladder bands
CH Lab
Add 0.01*VOL g of agarose to a clean glass bottle.
Pour VOL/50 ml of 50xTAE in a graduated cylinder. Fill up to VOL ml with di water.
Add the resulting VOL ml of 1xTAE to the glass bottle with agarose.
Microwave, at 7, the bottle (loose cap!) until it boils.
Carefully remove bottle (can be super heated!) and check for the total absence of particles. Microwave again if needed.
Prepare a gel box, with comb, and fill it up with the agarose solution (maybe not the whole solution is needed).
Add 0.05 µl per ml of gel in the box of Red Gel (it's in the iGEM drawer) and stirr until disolved.
Wait until cold and solidified.
Carefully remove comb.
Place the box in the electrophoresis chamber.
Fill up the electrophresis chamber with 1x TAE buffer.
Add blue dye to the DNA samples (6x loading buffer, that is 10 µl in 50 µl of DNA solution).
Inject 30 µl of ladder marker in the first well (that's 1 µg of DNA).
Inject 60 µl of each DNA solution in the other wells.
Set voltage to 70-90 V and run for 30-40 min, or until the dye reaches the last 25% of the gel length (DNA travels from - to +).
Place the gel under the camera, cover, turn UV on and take photos!
Preparing the ladder:
get 1kb ladder DNA from the freezer (500 µg/ml).
for 30 charges, 30 µl per charge, we need 900 µl:
60 µl of 1kb ladder DNA
150 µl of dye (6x loading buffer)
690 µl of water
BM Lab
In this lab the gels are slightly different. The total volumes for the small, the medium and the large gel are respectively 60ml, 80ml and 90ml. As we use 0.5x TAE buffer instead of 1x, we can use higher voltages (170V seems to work fine). The gel should run 20-40 minutes, not more. As the gel is thinner, load less DNA (up to ~10ul).
150 ml of gel were prepared. 8 µl of Gel Red were used.
The gel was run at 120 V for 15 minutes.

Comments
The first well is the ladder, and the 7th is the non-digested plasmid. In the others we can observe two bands, as expected.
