Morning
The two plates, with RO + Spectinomycin, with 50 and 100 µg/ml, wrapped with parafilm and put in the fridge after overnight at 37ºC.
Preparing a Maxiprep for 12th July
Two maxipreps to be done:
LovTAP + Ampicillin, transformed with our cells the 28 June.
RO + Spectinomycin 100 µg/ml, transformed with our cells the 10 July.
We use 2 big erlenmeyers (like 1l), to allow the liquid to be shaken (bacteria like it).
We want a volume of 200 ml for each, with 100 µg/ml of antibiotic. This means 200 µl of antibiotic per maxiprep (antibiotics have both a concentration of 100 mg/ml).
Steps:
Take the 2 plates from the fridge and let warm in oven for 5 minutes, 37ºC.
Take the antibiotics from the freezer and let thaw.
Fill the 2 erlenmeyers with 200 ml of LB each.
Add 200 µl of antibiotic to each, spect to RO and amp to LovTAP.
Pick a colony from each plate with a pipete tip and add it to the resp. erlenmeyer.
Leave overnight in the incubator, turning, at 37ºC.
Protocol: None
Forgot to insert protocol.
