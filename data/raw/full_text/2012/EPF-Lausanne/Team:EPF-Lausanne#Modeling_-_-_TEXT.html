Human Practices
Acknowledgments
To better understand the possibilities of this project, we've modeled different aspects of the protein and the elements around it. Please select the subject you want to know more about:
3D structure of the new fusion protein LovTAP-VP16
Why and how we think the LovTAP-VP16 protein works?
Photoactivation
What proportion of  LovTAP-VP16 should we expect to be active depending on the lightning pattern?
Expression levels
Getting a rough idea of the expression levels of reporter protein we can expect.
Bioreactor - Simulator
Simulating the bioreactor lighting will give us an idea of the scalability of this type of production method.
Bioreactor - Assembly
We built our lighting device from scratch. Here are a few pictures of that process.
