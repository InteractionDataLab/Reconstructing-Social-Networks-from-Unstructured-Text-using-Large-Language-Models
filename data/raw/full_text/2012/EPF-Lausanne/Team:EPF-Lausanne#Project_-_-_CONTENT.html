This protein expression method presents several issues. Our project focuses on one: getting a mammalian cell to express the desired protein when we want it to. Currently, bioreactors in industry rely heavily on small signaling molecules to get the cells to respond. The time it takes for these molecules to diffuse through the cell culture medium and their subsequent purification from the final product are the primary limitations. To allow for finer control over gene expression, our project studied the implementation of two different light-induced genetic (or optogenetic) switches. Both enable tight regulation of gene expression and eliminate the problem of removing signaling molecules during the final purification of the synthesized protein.
</P><P>Many of the proteins synthesized for therapeutic purposes can also be toxic to the cells that produce them. Precise control of gene expression in these cases is crucial to the viability of the cells being cultivated. Small signaling molecules aren't ideal for these purposes but light is instantaneous and easy to modulate.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_Simple_Switch">The Simple Switch</SPAN></H3><P>The first switch we studied is an untested fusion protein designed to act as a light-induced transcriptional activator in mamallian cells. The LovTAP-VP16 protein consists of a Lov2 domain (from <I>Avena Sativa</I>) a Trp repressor (from bacteria) and a VP16 transactional activating domain (from the <I>Herpes simplex</I> virus). A first version of this fusion protein was developed at the University of Chicago and later characterized and used as a bacterial repressor by the EPFL 2009 iGEM team. The protein binds to a Trp promoter after undergoing a conformational change when exposed to light. By fusing the LovTAP protein to a viral promoter, the idea was to turn the protein into a light activated DNA binding protein. When the Trp promoter is bound to the LovTAP-VP16 protein, the viral promoter on the C terminal recruits RNA polymerase II to the site and favors the transcription of the reporter gene next to the Trp promoter.
</P><P>This pathway is simple and light activation of LovTAP-VP16 results in direct activation of transcription. However, there are some major obstacles in this approach. The protein needs to be localized in the nucleus, bind tightly to DNA and remain attached long enough to activate transcription. 
</P><P>For this system, we will be using a DsRed readout to characterize the speed and efficiency of transcription by quantifying fluorescence output.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_Complex_Switch">The Complex Switch</SPAN></H3><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:252px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><A href="/Team:EPF-Lausanne/References#Fussenegger_2011" title="Team:EPF-Lausanne/References">Fusseneger 2011 et al.</A></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>In addition to LovTAP switch, we will be realizing another, more complex, melanopsin-based light switch developed by <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:EPF-Lausanne/References#Fussenegger_2011" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Fussenegger et al</A>. In this switch, a light-sensitive membrane bound protein, melanopsin, is inserted to trigger a signalling cascade. The melanopsin opens calcium channels in the cell which activates the NFAT pathway. By inserting a readout gene next to an NFAT promoter, we can promote its expression by triggering the release of calcium with light. In our expriments we used eGFP as our readout protein for the same reasons DsRed was used in the LovTAP-VP16 experiments.
This optogenetic switch takes advantage of an already existing mammalian pathway and limits the potential flaws related to promoting transcription once the pathway is activated. However, calcium is a broad effector and can have unintended consequences. Different cell types also react differently to calcium influx and this approach might not be generalizable. Fussenegger's team were successful in promoting expression in HEK (human embryo kidney) cells, and we will also try to get the pathway to work in CHO cells and compare the results to the work done in HEK cells.

But it has never been expresed before and, therefore, there is no literature telling us under what conditions it works or whether it works at all. It's a fusion protein between LovTAP, which is itself a fusion protein, and an activation domain from VP16, a viral transcription factor.
</P><P>In this construct, we don't want any kind of steric interaction between LovTAP and VP16, since that might alter the functionality of one or both parts, whereas we just want VP16 to be transported by LovTAP. To allow this, a linker might be needed to physically separate the domains. Since LovTAP-VP16 has to be in the nucleus of the cell to work, the minimal linker would be a 7 residues long Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) from the virus SV40, with the amino acid sequence PKKKRKV.
</P><P>In order to check visually if a longer linker would be needed, we put together the existing crystal structures of the domains LovTAP-VP16 consists of: LOV2, TrpR, NLS and VP16.

make it controllable by light. This is done by fusing it to a light-sensitive protein, the
plant phototropin LOV2 (Light-Oxygen-Voltage), whose sensitivity to blue light is conferred by the
ligand chromophore flavin mononucleotide (FMN). The fusion is done in a way that ensures that both domains
share a common α-helix, which would create a sort of lever that could transfer the conformational
changes in light-activated LOV2 towards TrpR, triggering its activation.

One example would be the regulation in the tryptophan (Trp) operon,
a group of genes studied in <I>E.Coli</I> that are required for the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan.
The expression of these genes can be blocked by the homodimeric protein tryptophan repressor
(TrpR), by binding the operator of the operon. The TrpR repressing function is only active when
tryptophan is bound to its allosteric sites, i.e. it blocks the production of tryptophan when the
concentration of tryptophan is high.

It's still not clear whether or not it is localized in the nucleus and properly binds DNA with the additional VP16 promoter domain.
</P><P>A nuclear extract with western blotting or immunofluorescence techniques could be used to localize the protein. If the localisation of the protein isn't correct, the nuclear localisation signal might need modification or extension.
</P><P>A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay could be used to verify the binding characteristics of the LovTAP protein in the case where it is localised in the nucleus but still doesnt work.
</P><P>If the protein can bind DNA and is localized in the nucleus, a different promoter/linker combination could be used ahead of VP16 to initiate transcription.
</P><P>Other verions of LovTAP which respond better to light have also been characterized by Strickland et al. 
</P><P><A href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v7/n8/full/nmeth.1473.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Improvement of Lov domain based photoswitches</A></P><P>By using an improved version of the protein with a more dynamic response to light we could improve the DNA binding response to light and activation of transcription.
</P><P>By using a positive feedback loop, the difference between the dark and the light state can be increased <A href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/%28SICI%291521-2254%28200003/04%292:2%3C107::AID-JGM91%3E3.0.CO%3B2-E/full?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.jtitle=Curr%20Opin%20Cell%20Biol&amp;rft.atitle=Transcriptional%20repression%20in%20development&amp;rft.volume=8&amp;rft.spage=358&amp;rft.epage=364&amp;rft.date=1996&amp;rft.aulast=Gray&amp;rft.aufirst=S&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fwiley.com%3AOnlineLibrary" class="external autonumber" rel="nofollow">[2]</A> which would make detecting the signal easier.
</P><P>Lastly, the creation of stable cell lines for either of our expression systems would make sense for a longer term project. The original experiment conducted by Fussenegger et al. used antibiotic resistance to select cells that had integrated the transfected DNA. With a homogenous population of cells, it would be easier to characterize the efficiency of the system in use.
</P><P>With our transient expression experiment for both switches, we had heterogenous cell populations. The efficiency of our transfections was around 30% and each cell integrated our vectors at different places in the genome. The constitutive levels of LovTAP-VP16 or melanopsin proteins as well as the accesibility of the readout and promoter on the genome varied within the population of transfected cells.
</P><P>It could be that our proteins behave the way we would like them to in a few cells among the many that were transfected, but that most of the time integration of the transfected DNA is weak and expression levels are too low.
