CHO Transfection with LovTAP only
Protocol: Transfection of CHO cells
This is the transfection protocol used at the LBTC lab for CHO DG44 cells. The transfection reagent is PEI ( polyethylenimine ).
Please use the provided Excel sheet to calculate the volume of plasmid you should add to the cells. Replace every value in red by your own, then print the sheet out and follow the provided protocol.
1. Passage seed 1 day prior to transfection.
2. Prepare tubes (yellow caps with holes) by addition of the calculated amount of DNA.
3. Centrifuge the necessary volume of seed (after a PCV measurement), remove conditioned medium with the pump (use a 2 ml serological pipet with a broken neck) and resuspend (first in 10 ml) in necessary volume of fresh medium to achieve the required cell density (3 mio/ml).
4. Add 5 mL of the cell suspension to the tube with DNA and mix orbitally.
5. Add the PEI (45 µl) to the Cell+DNA mixture as soon as possible, flick 3 times.
6. Place in the incubator at 37°C.
We trasfected a batch of CHO cells with LovTAP only. We made two tubes with 100% LovTAP and one with 95% LovTAP and 5% pOri-eGFP (this is a control plasmid with a very high constitutive expression of GFP, it is used to check if the transfection has worked, with the Guava).
Guava Measurements on HEK cells transfected with pHY42 and a GFP readout
Protocol: Fluorescence (Guava)
Prepare your samples by measuring their PCV (or estimating the cell amount according to the doubling rate). Dilute them with PBS in order to have between 200 and 500 cells/µl. Prepare at least one well that has seed cells.
Steps 1 to 4 are optional and should be done from time to time.
1. Trash the waste on the bottom right of the machine if it is full before you start.
2. Put tubes with bleach (detergent) at the right positions.
3. Run 'Cytosoft 5.3'
4. Click Clean and Shut Down -> This would take around 15 min.
5. After cleaning, click Guava Express Plus on the left column.
6. Go to Analysis mode and click 'Open Data Set'.
7. Go to the 'iGEM' folder and open the 'Setting' file.
8. Go to Acquisition - and hold here.
9. Go to the desktop and run WorkEdit 5.3.
10. Highlight the wells you are going to use, check "Acquire this sample".
11. Label them as Guava Express Plus, check the "Mix for 3 seconds", set the speed from high to medium. Optionally, fill the sample ID and the dilution factor.
12. Save and go back to Cytosoft 5.3.
13. Go to Acquisition, start the worklist.
14. Place the 96-well plate into the tray, make sure the A1 well is where it should be.
15. Name the file as 'Today's date_title'
16. When you are asked to adjust the settings, check a well that contains seed cells.
17. Compare with the worklist, check if the flow and the amount of cells detected are reasonable.
18. Click "Next step" and then "Resume".
19. Wait until all the wells are measured - data will be saved automatically.
20. Take the 96-well plate out and insert the tubes that are required for cleaning.
21. Go to Main menu and click 'Clean and shut down'.
A routine measurement of green fluorescence has been performed on the HEK cells transfected with melanopsin. We didn't see a big difference of GFP expression between transfected and non-transfected cells. However, we can notice that the cells that have been under the Arduino blue light for a while have a different shape and less viability.
RO Biobrick PCR
Protocol: PCR
PCR is a reaction that makes it possible (and relatively easy) to amplify a certain region of DNA. The first step is the selection of that region (and the design of the relevant primers). Primer design can be done by hand, or by using our Primer Design Helper . Once done, order the primers (in our case, we ordered from them IDT ).
When you've received the primers, prepare them and make sure you've got your PCR kit (we used the "Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase"). Start preparing your master mix, the composition for one tube is:
1X Mastermix 20μl reaction, add in this order
Reagent
Volume [μl]
Water
Complete to total volume of 20μl
HF-Buffer (5x)
4
DMSO (optional)
0.6
dNTPs
0.4
Forward primer (50μM)
0.2
Reverse primer (50μM)
0.2
Template (10ng/μl)
0.5
Phusion HF polymerase
0.2
Prepare one or two extra tubes-worth of reagent (you'll use some liquid on the walls of your tips).
Once you've finished, you should run the resulting products on a gel to check if everything went as planned.
Tips
Thaw the HF-Buffer, DMSO and dNTPs before making the mastermix.
Avoid taking the Phusion-HF polymerase out of the freezer (only take it out briefly when you need to add it).
If the reactions have different primers and/or template, add the polymerase right after the dNTPs, split the mastermix and add the rest.
Don't forget positive and negative controls
Primers should have similar Tms (less than 5°C).
Primer Tm calculation is a less exact science than it should be (just test several tools and compare their results). If you're not sure what the correct Tm is, consider using a gradient PCR.
Avoid primers with strong secondary structures.
PCR can introduce mutations. Don't forget to sequence your final product (this could be your final plasmid): you really don't want to lose a few weeks because of a "corrupt" plasmid.
The BioBrick tails were added to the readout gene for LovTAP experiments.
Gel electrophoresis
Protocol: Gel Electrophoresis
Agarose concentration depends on the size of the DNA to be run. We will mostly use 1%. VOL is the desired volume of gel in ml:

1kb ladder bands
CH Lab
Add 0.01*VOL g of agarose to a clean glass bottle.
Pour VOL/50 ml of 50xTAE in a graduated cylinder. Fill up to VOL ml with di water.
Add the resulting VOL ml of 1xTAE to the glass bottle with agarose.
Microwave, at 7, the bottle (loose cap!) until it boils.
Carefully remove bottle (can be super heated!) and check for the total absence of particles. Microwave again if needed.
Prepare a gel box, with comb, and fill it up with the agarose solution (maybe not the whole solution is needed).
Add 0.05 µl per ml of gel in the box of Red Gel (it's in the iGEM drawer) and stirr until disolved.
Wait until cold and solidified.
Carefully remove comb.
Place the box in the electrophoresis chamber.
Fill up the electrophresis chamber with 1x TAE buffer.
Add blue dye to the DNA samples (6x loading buffer, that is 10 µl in 50 µl of DNA solution).
Inject 30 µl of ladder marker in the first well (that's 1 µg of DNA).
Inject 60 µl of each DNA solution in the other wells.
Set voltage to 70-90 V and run for 30-40 min, or until the dye reaches the last 25% of the gel length (DNA travels from - to +).
Place the gel under the camera, cover, turn UV on and take photos!
Preparing the ladder:
get 1kb ladder DNA from the freezer (500 µg/ml).
for 30 charges, 30 µl per charge, we need 900 µl:
60 µl of 1kb ladder DNA
150 µl of dye (6x loading buffer)
690 µl of water
BM Lab
In this lab the gels are slightly different. The total volumes for the small, the medium and the large gel are respectively 60ml, 80ml and 90ml. As we use 0.5x TAE buffer instead of 1x, we can use higher voltages (170V seems to work fine). The gel should run 20-40 minutes, not more. As the gel is thinner, load less DNA (up to ~10ul).
The PCR products were run on a gel.
