Loading Plan
Lane 1: Ladder
Lane 2: Empty well
Lane 3: 10microL of VP16 only
Lane 4: 25microL of VP16 only
Lane 5: Nontransfected CHO cell - High concentration (5million)
Lane 6: Sample 1 48h of expression
Lane 7: Sample 2 48h of expression
Lane 8: Sample 1 72h of expression
Lane 9: Sample 2 72h of expression
Lane 10: Nontransfected CHO cell - Same concentration as samples
Result: The lane 9 (Lovtap-VP16 transfected CHO cell) and lane 10 (non-transfected CHO cell) have intensity difference around 30~35kDa area.
