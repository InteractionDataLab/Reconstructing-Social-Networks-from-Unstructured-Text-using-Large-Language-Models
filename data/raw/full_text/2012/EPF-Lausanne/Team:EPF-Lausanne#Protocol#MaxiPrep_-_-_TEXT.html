Protocol: MaxiPrep
The evening before, take a big Erlenmeyer (at least 1L) and put 200ml LB in it. Add the appropriate antibiotics at the correct concentration (ampicilin: 200ul of 100mg/ml solution). Put in bacteria from a single colony of a freshly streaked plate or from a glycerol stock (warning: taking bacteria from glycerol stock seems to cause them to start growing later - due to thawing? - add one-two hours to the incubation time). Put them in the incubator for 14-15 hours (the contents of the bottle should be yellow-ish between translucid and opaque).
We then use the MaxiPrep kit (Plasmid DNA Purification kit) and protocol from Macherey-Nagel.
The complete handbook can be found here . We usually use the protocol that starts at page 24 for "Maxi".
