Observation of the transformed plates
The transformed plates from the day before have been taken out of the incubator and put at 4°C. There was growth on the pMP plate and on the pGL4.30 plate. However, there was nothing at all on the pHY42 plate, which means we are going to have to re-transform this one. The negative control plate was empty.
Meeting, brainstorming
Met with the T.A.s, discussed the plasmids and the cloning, started primer design.
