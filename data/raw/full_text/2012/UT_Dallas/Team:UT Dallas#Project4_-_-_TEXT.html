N Populations
Toolkit
In order to further aid the future competitors of iGem, we have included this distributive computing tool kit. This tool kit includes the biobricks that we have used in all of our projects that allowed us to build our multi-population systems. It is a foundation for all competitors to use in order to build a system of populations, whether it be one population, two populations or “n” number of populations. The toolkit is organized for easy access and understanding. All of the biobricks are organized by function. These categories include: intermediate, receiver, reporter, repressor, signalling and repressor.
