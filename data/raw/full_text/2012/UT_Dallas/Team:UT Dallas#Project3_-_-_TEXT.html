Three Populations AND Gate Overview
The goal of this project is to apply the concept of AND Gate to quorum sensing processes in bacteria. An AND Gate is a logic gate that emits a signal if and only if it receives all of its inputs. In this project, we cloned three bacterial populations. The first strain of bacteria produced quorum sensing molecule AHL, while the second population produced the quorum sensing molecule Ai-1.  The third population was cloned in such a way that it requires both the quorum sensing molecules in order to work. Also, each of the cell population has its own fluorescence i.e. population 1 fluoresces yellow, population 2 fluoresces red and population 3 fluoresces blue. If any of the two quorum sensing molecules are absent, third population will not fluoresce.
