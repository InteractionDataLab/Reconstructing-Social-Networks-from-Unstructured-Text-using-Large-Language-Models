Sundeep Kuntimad
My name is Sundeep Kuntimad. I’m a junior Mechanical Engineering major on the premed track at the University of Texas at Dallas. I have not finalized what I want to do in life yet because I am keeping my options open to see what opportunities lay in store for me. I joined iGEM for this reason and because it is a very interesting experience for me to see what it is all about and to work with people of different backgrounds and departments.
