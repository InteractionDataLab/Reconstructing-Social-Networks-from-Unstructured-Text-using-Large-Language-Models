Team:UT Dallas/flip flop
From 2012.igem.org
Project: Toggle Switch
For this part of the project, our team created a working flip flop mechanism with two different colonies of bacteria. Basically, one colony promotes the other colony and vice-versa. I have no idea what else to add here, so I'm just typing stuff.
