Triple Population Biobricks
Population 1 AND GATE <a href=" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K876065 ">BBa_K876065</a>
This part produces the quorom sensing molecule AHL which combined with the quorom sensing molecule Ai-1 activates population 3.
Population 2 AND GATE <a href=" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K876049 ">BBa_K876049</a>
This part produces the quorom sensing molecule Ai-1 which combined with the quorom sensing molecule AHL activates population 3.
<a href=" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K876066 ">BBa_K876066</a>
This part gives the output for the AND gate mechanism by being activated through the quorom sensing molecules by population 1 and population 3.
Population 1 oscillator <a href=" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K876047 ">BBa_K876047</a>
This part produces the quorom sensing molecule AHL which in turn activates Population 2 when the AHL concentration passes a certain threshold.
Population 3 <a href=" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K876057 ">BBa_K876057</a> & <a href=" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K876060 ">BBa_K876060</a>
These parts combined forms population 3 which produces CFP after receiving the quorom sensing molecule Ai-1 from population 2.
<a href=" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K876061 ">BBa_K876061 </a>
This part along with plac-LuxR contitutes population 2 which produces RFP and the quorom sensing mulecule Ai-1 after receiving AHl molecules from Population 1.
