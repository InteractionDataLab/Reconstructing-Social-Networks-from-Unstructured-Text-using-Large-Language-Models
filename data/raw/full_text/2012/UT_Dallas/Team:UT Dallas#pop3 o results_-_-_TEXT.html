Three Populations Cascade Results
Phase 1: Promotion
To test our three basic populations two test tubes containing 2mL of ampicillin-containing media were mixed with 400 microliters of each of the populations’ DNA.  However, only one of the test tubes were induced by 1.5 mL of pseudo-population 3. In this way the non-induced test tube acted as a negative control.
Through our testing we have shown that our three Basic Populations successfully work together. Populations 1, 2 and 3 all exhibited a significant increase in fluorescence when induced, compared to when it was not induced
