Design
Our single population toggle utilizes the LacI and TetR inhibitor proteins in order to function. When running properly, one side should become dominant and completely turn off the other side

When the pLac promoter is running, it produces RFP and TetR. The TetR will inhibit pTet, preventing the production of Lac I and GFP. Likewise, if the pTet promoter is running, it will produce GFP and LacI, turning off the pLac promoter in the process. IPTG and ATc prevent LacI and TetR from binding to their respective promoters. By placing one of these chemicals in solution with our cells, we can affect which state the mechanism will lock into. Once locked into one of the two states, the cells should stay in this state even if no longer in the presence of IPTG or ATc.
