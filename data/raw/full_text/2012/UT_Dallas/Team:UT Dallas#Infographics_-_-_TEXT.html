iGEM Ingenious Engineering
iGEM’s almost unbelievable growth is easily seen by the dramatic increase in teams and countries that now participate in this international competition. From five teams from the U.S. in 2004 to over 200 in 2012, iGEM has reached out to all corners of the world (though Africa still needs some iGEM outreach).
Team Development
Year 2012
Diversity is brought to iGEM through the teams it hosts and also through the projects it presents. As of 2012, there are eight main tracks that a team can adopt as the overarching theme of their project. This allows for a clear picture of what topics are currently popular and what topics have room for more growth.
Tracks Through the Years
Year 2011
Though iGEM is not all about winning, it is interesting to see how the number of medalists have increased over the years. Unfortunately there has been a rather large decrease in 2011. We don’t know if this is because iGEM judges are holding the competitors to a higher standard or if there have been some halfhearted attempts to join this prestigious competition.
Winners Through the Years
Year 2011
With the increase of winners and the diversity of teams that have accumulated internationally, we have high hopes that iGEM will continue to bring about innovative ideas that will never cease to stifle the mind of what is possible and how we can help the world.
PRET Reporters
These PRET reporters are categorized according to their binding promoter. They are categorized into the following ways: Reporter binded with a constitutive promoter, reporter binded with a inducible promoter, reporters binded with repressible promoters, and finally reporters without promoters. This categorization makes it simpler to select the appropriate reporter required by the various needs of teams.
