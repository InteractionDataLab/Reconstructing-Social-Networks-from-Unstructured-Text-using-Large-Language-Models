Registry
Anyone and everyone who has ever participated in iGEM would agree that the Registry of Parts is not the most user-friendly program to use. Our team decided it is imperative for the Registry to be redone in a more user-friendly fashion. Therefore, this year we proposed a layout for a "Registry 2.0".
