Edward Neill
My name is Edward Neill. I'm a junior molecular biology major here at UTD. iGEM has been an incredible experience of endless possibilities of what you can engineer.  I'm really grateful for the opportunity to participate in this and I hope that the upcoming years bring so much for phenomenal ideas to iGEM.
