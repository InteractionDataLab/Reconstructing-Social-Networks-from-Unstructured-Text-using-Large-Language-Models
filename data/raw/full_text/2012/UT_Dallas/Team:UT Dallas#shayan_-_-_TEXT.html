Shayan Ghassemi
My name is Shayan Ghassemi. I'm an undergraduate at UT Dallas and I plan to get my Bachelor's in Bioengineering. IGEM is truly a great learning experience, especially if you are interesting in pursuing research. I'm very grateful for the knowledge I have gained and the friends I have made.
