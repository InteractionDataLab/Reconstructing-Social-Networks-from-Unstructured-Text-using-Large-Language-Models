Zak Ashour
I am sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering. I was introduced to iGem by Dr. Bleris in my Intro to Biomedical Engineering class. I have really enjoyed all aspects of this competition, from research to work in and outside of the lab work. Its such a great opportunity to have hand on training in such an exciting field of study. I will be sure to use my new skills to further my efforts to become a mad scientist whose work backfires and changes him into a superhuman.
