Future Prospects
The ultimate goal of the dual strain toggle switch was to show that we could lock a single population into either an activated or deactivated state based on the activation or deactivation of another strain. Working on the dual strain toggle gave us experience and a better understanding of quorum signalling interactions. Also, our project allowed us to develop procedures for combining two different populations. More generally, we would show that populations of different function could coordinate in an effective manner. That is, we would cause multiple populations with different functions to interact, forming one complex system that would otherwise be impossible or very difficult to generate in a single population. For example, we had in mind a counting system that would utilize a flip flop switch mechanism as well as signalling and coordination between several population of E. coli. In essence, each population would contain a similar flip flop switch mechanism. The only differences between the mechanisms of different populations would be the input and output. That is, the output of one population would serve as the input of another population. The activation or deactivation of each population could serve as a sort of binary code from which data - such as number of chemical stimulations- could be read.
