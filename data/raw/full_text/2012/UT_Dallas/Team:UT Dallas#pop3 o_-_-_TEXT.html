Three Population Cascade Overview
Our team worked to create an three population signal propagation mechanism with three different strains of bacteria. Each of these populations uses a different quorum sensing molecule to promote one strain while repressing the other. The promoted strain then fluoresces and sends out another quorum sensing molecule that promotes next strain. This process continues with each strain, thus creating an oscillator.
