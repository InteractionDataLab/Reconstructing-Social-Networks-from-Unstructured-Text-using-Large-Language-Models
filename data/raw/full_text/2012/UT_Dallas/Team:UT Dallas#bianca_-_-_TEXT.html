Bianca David
My name is Bianca, and I am currently a senior in high school at Plano East Senior High School graduating in 2013! As I became interested and involved in this years iGem group the research and experience has allowed me to observe more in depth biology lab work and skills and to gain an interest in the field. My future aspirations are to obtain a degree in medicine and achieve a career as a medical doctor! I loved the experience even though it was initially intimidating being this young and partially clueless but I’ve learned tons!
