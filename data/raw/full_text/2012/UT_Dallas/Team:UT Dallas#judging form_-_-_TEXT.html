At least one new submitted and highly-documented standard BioBrick Part or Device. A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts.
BBa_K876001,BBa_K876008, BBa_K876065, BBa_K876049 and BBa_K876066 have been submitted and documented.
Silver:In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements..
1
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected
BBa_K876001,BBa_K876008, BBa_K876065, BBa_K876049 and BBa_K876066 have been demonstrated to work as expected.
2
Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
BBa_K876001,BBa_K876008 have been characterized.
Gold: In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, any one or more of the following:
1
Improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information back on the Experience Page of the Registry.
We build the biobrick BBa_K876001. This is an improved  version of the BBa_K177038 Toggle switch. We also build a toolkit for building multiple population quorum sensing based systems. N Populations .
2
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
We brought to attention the possible security and safety issues of garage labs and bio-terrorism. We studied ways to create our own lab equipment from household or otherwise easily obtainable items.
