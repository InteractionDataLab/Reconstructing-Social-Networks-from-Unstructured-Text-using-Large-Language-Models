I'm a sophomore at UT Dallas majoring in Biomedical Engineering. Am I obsessed with cats? That's debatable. :P I joined iGEM because I heard about it through one of my professors and thought it sounded interesting. I mean, you get to alter bacterial DNA; how cool is that?! I definitely learned a lot through iGEM and am excited about my first Jamboree!
