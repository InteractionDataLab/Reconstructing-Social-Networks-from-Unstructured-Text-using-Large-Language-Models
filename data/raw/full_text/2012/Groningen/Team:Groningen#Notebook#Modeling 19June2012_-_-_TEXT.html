Added thermodynamic constraints to 763 out of 1,681 reactions in iBsu1103.     Data was available for 751 out of 1,138 metabolites based on their KEGG ID.     Data was sourced from eQuilibrator .
Cell growth is possible with only D-glucose, water, glutamine, and potassium.
Preparing to modify GAMS code to allow for dynamic FBA to observe the external concentrations over time.
