Renske
Measured FNR-GFP inside psac-cm inside B.subtilis 168. Same setup as 12/09.
After setup OD =
0.889 (rotten meat, FNR-GFP)
1.040 (no meat, WT)
0.675 (no meat, FNR-GFP)
1.435 (no meat, FNR-GFP, not inoculated again (old culture to see wether stationary phase induces GFP))
further microscopic part is executed by Arjan/Elbrich: no results.
Elbrich
pSac-Cm + RFP NanoDrop
1: 231,3 ng/ul
2: 131,0 ng/ul
3: 238,9 ng/ul
4: 166,8 ng/ul
After cutting, sizes on gel were correct: 2 bands, one at 5000 bp (pSac-Cm) and one at 1000 bp (RFP)
Nisa
Result of E. coli transformation: we FINALLY have some blue colonies! E. coli containing fnr+amilCP and sboA+amilCP appeared blue. The other transformans are white/yellowish and white/pinkish(not very sure about the colour differences)
O/N culture all the transformans for further checking!
