Yonathan and Elbrich
Digestion for preparation of the ligation of pFNR-violacein in pSac-Cm and pLacI-violacein in pSac-Cm.
Violacein did not have the right size, so ligation of the construct was not possible.
Emeraldo
Cut AmilGFP, AmilCP, BBa_K274110, and pSac-CM+terminator (colony 3,6, and 10) with EcoRI and PstI, purified them from gel, inserting all the cut reporters inside the cut pSac-CM+terminator (only psac from colony 3) with ligation reaction, E. coli DH5alpha transformation with the ligated product.
