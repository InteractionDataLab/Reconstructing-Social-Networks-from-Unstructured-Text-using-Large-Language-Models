Presentation course at the Speech-Language Pathology department of Hanzehogeschool Groningen
Six of us got a 1 1/2 hour private course on presentation skills. We got some interesting tips about how to present the content of the presentation, how to improve the loudness of your voice and on how to make sure you don't speak too fast. And the most important one: contact with your audience!
