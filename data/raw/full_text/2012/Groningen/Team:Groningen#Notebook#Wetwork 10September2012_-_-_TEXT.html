Elbrich/Renske/Tom
First fluorescence microscope measurements with our pBADmeat promoters coupled to GFP:
grew FNR-GFP-psac-cm Bacillus subtilis in SMM in the same setup as the micro-array experiment (see 27/06 and 2/07).
results: no fluorescence measured, only autofluorescence.
Renske
ligated rfp+psac-cm (already cut by emeraldo on 9/09).
Nisa
Transformation result: overgrown E. coli. Redo everything with the exact same protocol as 08/09
