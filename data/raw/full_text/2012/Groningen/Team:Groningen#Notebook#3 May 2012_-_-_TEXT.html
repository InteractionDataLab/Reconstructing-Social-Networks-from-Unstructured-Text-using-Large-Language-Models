Weekly meeting
We have a topic since last week, now is the time to dive into literature. A planning has been made, subtopic groups, etc.
We also have lab keys and can enter our lab. We made lists of equipment before, and hope that we can wear labcoats in two weeks...
Meeting with Oscar
Short discussion with Oscar about the bottlenecks of our topic and how to tackle them.
Preparations of bio-art with Leen van Wijngaarden
In the bio-art project (Night of Arts and Science), high school students will be given the opportunity to make their own bio-art. We poured 500 plates of normal LB medium with Leen as a preparation.
