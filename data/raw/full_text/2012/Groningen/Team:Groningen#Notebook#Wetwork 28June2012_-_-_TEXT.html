Tom
Cutting plasmid biobricks LuxR (BBa_R0062), LuxI (BBa_J37034) and backbone (BBa_090403) with EcoR1 and loading them on an 0.8% agarose gel.
Renske
Growth curves with different start OD's. O/N culture of Bacillus subtilis 168 in LB diluted to OD(600) = 0.3 (2x: A1 & A2) and 0.4 (2x B1 & B2). It takes 2 hours to grow from OD(600) = 0.3 to OD(600) = 0.8.
Micro-Array test run.
Ran the setup made on 27th of june with a Bacillus subtilis culture (start OD(600) = 0.3, diluted from growth curve culture A1 (at OD(600) = 0.8)).
After 2 hours running in the 37 degrees Celsius room, the OD(600) was 1.5. A bit too much! Tomorrow: start with OD(600) = 0.1.
