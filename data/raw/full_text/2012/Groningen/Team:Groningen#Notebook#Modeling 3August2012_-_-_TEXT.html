Updated the main modeling page.
1. Found a review article on integrating regulatory networks:
L. Cloots and K. Marchal, “Network-based functional modeling of genomics, transcriptomics and metabolism in bacteria,”     Current Opinion in Microbiology, vol. 14, no. 5, pp. 599–607, Oct. 2011.
2. From the review article, it looks like the PROM technique can be extended using idFBA.
J. Min Lee, E. P. Gianchandani, J. A. Eddy, and J. A. Papin, “Dynamic Analysis of Integrated Signaling,     Metabolic, and Regulatory Networks,” PLoS Comput Biol, vol. 4, no. 5, p. e1000086, May 2008.
