Arjan/Renske
SboA+aGFP characterization test, Same experiment as yesterday, but now with rotted meat and inoculated with O/N culture (20ul). Samples were took every hour, measured the OD(600), 395nm absorption and pellet color. The rotted meat seems to stimulated pigment production as the yellow pellet is seen in an earlier stage.
