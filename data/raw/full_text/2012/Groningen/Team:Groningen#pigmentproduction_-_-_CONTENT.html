			We wanted to use pigments as reporters in our designed genetic construct. Why did we choose for pigments and not use a common
			reporter like Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)? Well, we imagined our Food Warden system as a consumer product. 
			Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect everyone to have a fluorescence microscope available at home. Pigments, however, 
			are recognizable by the naked eye and come in many color varieties, but a main challenge we had to accept was that 
			these pigments had yet to be expressed <I>Bacillus subtilis </I>. We decided to take the risk, and look the great results!
			
			We identified many pigments in the Registry and choose three BioBricks that we could express independently 
			so we could create different colors for every single device. The parts that have been utilized as a reporter gene are:
			</P><P><Z2>Lycopene (BBa_K274100)</Z2>
			Coral red pigment biobrick CrtEBI with RBS (BBa_K274100), created by Team Cambridge 2009, was used as one of our reporter genes in
			our volatile detection device. Details concerning this part can be found in Team Cambridge 2009 page.
			<A class="inlink" href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K274100">BBa_K274100</A>.
			
			Our team has coupled this biobrick part with our promoters:  alsT, fnr, and sboA. The cloning was done in BBa_K823023 
			(plasmid backbone for <I>B. subtilis</I>, engineered by <FONT color="#ff6700">LMU Munich 2012</FONT>), to allow color
			expression in <I>B. subtilis</I>. We utilized a strong RBS BBa_B0034 for pigment expression in <I>E. coli</I> and <I>B. subtilis</I>.
			</P><P><I>E. coli</I> DH5a containing fnr promoter + lycopene coding gene. The  red color was expressed due to the leakiness of the fnr promoter.
			</P><P><I>B. subtilis</I> 168 containing promoters (alsT, fnr, and sboA) coupled with the lycopene coding gene. The red color was not as 
			highly expressed as in <I>E. coli</I>. This phenotype was due to the weak promoter of <I>B. subtilis</I> that was used in this 
			construct and the RBS for <I>E. coli</I> that was utilized for this device construct.
			<Z2>AmilCP (BBa_K592009)</Z2>
			AmilCP is a blue/purple chromoprotein biobrick part (BBa_K592009), created by Team Uppsala Sweden 2011, and was used as one of 
			the reporter genes in our volatile detection device. Details concerning this part can be found in Team Uppsala Sweden 2011 page. 
			<A class="inlink" href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K592009">BBa_K592009</A>. AmilCP has a sequence similar to the other 
			coral chromoprotein, only its maximum absorption is shifted by 10 nm causing the color to appear blue instead of purple.
			
			Our team has coupled this biobrick part with our promoters:  alsT, fnr, and sboA. The cloning was done in BBa_K818000 
			(plasmid backbone for B. subtilis, engineered by team Groningen 2012), to allow color expression in <I>B. subtilis</I>. 
			We utilized a strong RBS BBa_B0034 for pigment expression in <I>E. coli</I> and <I>B. subtilis</I>. This reporter coding gene was strongly
			expressed in <I>E. coli</I> due to the leakiness of the promoters. However, the expression in <I>B. subtilis</I> was not as 
			leaky as in <I>E. coli</I>.  This phenotype in <I>B. subtilis</I> was due to the promoter strength and the RBS that was used in 
			this construct. The promoters are considered weak, therefore visible expression requires induction by volatiles produced
			by the rotten meat.
			</P><P><I>E. coli</I> DH5a containing sboA promoter + amilCP (left). Blue/purple colour was highly 
			expressed due to the leakiness of the promoter and a strong RBS for <I>E. coli</I>. However, the expression 
			of this part in <I>B. subtilis</I> was more subtle. <I>B. subtilis</I> containing sboA promoter + amilCP 
			(right) displayed faint blue colour on its colony. 
			<Z2>AmilCP (BBa_K592009)</Z2>
			AmilGFP is a yellow chromoprotein biobrick part (BBa_K592010), created by Team Uppsala Sweden 2011, and was used 
			as one of the reporter genes in our volatile detection device. Details concerning this part can be found in Team Uppsala 
			Sweden 2011 page. <A class="inlink" href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K592010">BBa_K592010</A>. 
			This chromoprotein is part of the green chromoprotein with maximum absorbtion at 503 nm.
			
			Our team has coupled this biobrick part with our promoters:  alsT, fnr, and sboA. The cloning was done in BBa_K818000 
			(plasmid backbone for <I>B. subtilis</I>, engineered by team Groningen 2012), to allow color expression in <I>B. subtilis</I>.
			We utilized a strong RBS BBa_B0034 for pigment expression in both <I>E. coli</I> and <I>B. subtilis</I>. This reporter coding 
			gene was strongly expressed in <I>E. coli</I> due to the leakiness of the promoters, while the expression in B. subtilis without 
			induction was considerably low. This low expression in <I>B. subtilis</I> was due to the promoter strength and the RBS that was 
			used in this construct. The promoters are considered weak, therefore visible expression requires induction by volatiles produced
			by the rotten meat.
			
			The volatile detection device containing sboA promoter and amilGFP has been tested in the presence of the rotten and fresh meat. 
			We found that under the presence of rotten meat our volatile detection device produced bright yellow color. On the other hand, when
			our device that was exposed to the volatiles produced by the fresh meat it produced a small amount of yellow color. The 
			comparison between <I>B. subtilis</I> containing sboA + amilGFP to <I>B. subtilis</I> 168 wildtype under the presence of rotten
			meat volatiles resulted in yellow pigment production by our device while no yellow pigment was produced in the wildtype strain. 
			The yellow color produced by our device was strong enough to be observed by the human naked eye.
			</P><P><I>E. coli</I> DH5a containing sboA promoter + amilGFP. Yellow color was highly expressed due to the leakiness of the
			promoter and a strong RBS for <I>E. coli</I>.

			Our setup for the volatile detection experiment using the sboA+amilGFP device (left). We compared the
			pigment expression by our device with the wildtype strain in the presence of rotten meat and without the presence of meat.
			When our device sensed volatiles produced by the rotten meat, the promoter was induced, resulting in the activation of the
			amilGFP coding gene and the production of the yellow color. At the end of the experiment, the cells were harvested and spun 
			down to obtain a better view on the cell pellet. The cell pellet from our device that was exposed to the rotten meat volatiles
			exhibited strong yellow color while the wildtype strain and the device that was not exposed to the volatiles were white (right).
