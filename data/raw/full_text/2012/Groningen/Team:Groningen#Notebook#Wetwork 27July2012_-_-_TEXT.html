GC: again the brine sample did not show any results. For the final test with brine the over night samples were used. the protocol for the GC was altered to 2 hours incubation at 60 degrees.
Further an organic solvent was used. Toluene was added to rotten meat samples and run on the GC using the the same protocol as the brine sample. Also blanc's of toluene were included for both columns. The total run for this program was 14 hours thus the results will be analyzed on monday.
