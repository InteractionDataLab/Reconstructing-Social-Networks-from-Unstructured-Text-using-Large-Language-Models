Buffers (RF1, RF2, EDTA, TAE 25x, TE, Tris) and TY broth were made and put them in the autoclave (check always Emeraldo's lab journal).   We're making competent E.coli cells this week for growing our Bio-Bricks, therefore E.coli Dh5a was plated out on fresh medium today.
MolGen will provided us space in the -80 freezer C at rack 17 F and G on the 6th floor. A PC is delivered and ready to use for making reservations of MolGen equipment.
And we performed a literature study to look for a potential 2 component system.
