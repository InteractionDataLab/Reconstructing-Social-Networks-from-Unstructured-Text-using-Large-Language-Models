Tom
Colony pcr with taq polymerase for the constructs: amilcp + alsT, lycopene + alsT, amilcp + fnr, lycopene + fnr, amilcp + sboA, lycopene + sboA and amilgfp + sboA.
The pcr products of amilcp + fnr, amilcp + sboA and amilgfp + sboA were succesfull. The constructs with lycopene need a longer elongation time. The primers for alsT are probably causing flaws.
Arjan
miniprep of psbic3 with alst+amilCP and  SboA+cmilCP/amilGFP/lycopene. Restriction control with EcoRI and PstI. All the construct with SboA are good and will be sent tomorrow.
