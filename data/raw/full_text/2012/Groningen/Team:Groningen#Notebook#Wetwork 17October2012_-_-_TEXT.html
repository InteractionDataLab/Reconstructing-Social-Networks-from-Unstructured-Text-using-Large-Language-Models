Tests were done with the construct psaccm-SboA-AmilGP with rotten and fresh meat in duplo. Samples were obtained every hour and plated in three different dilutions. Cells were spun down and resuspended in sz. The resuspended cells were analyzed with flowcytometrie and with a spectrophotometer for measuring OD (600nm) and color (359nm).
