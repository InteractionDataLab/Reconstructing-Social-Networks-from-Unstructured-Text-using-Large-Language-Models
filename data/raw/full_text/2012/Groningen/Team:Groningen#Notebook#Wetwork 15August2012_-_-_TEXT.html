Ligation of alsT(150, 250, 300, 500) with GFP and psb1c3 and pfu promotor with GFP and psb1c3.
Result: Transformation in E.coli was succesfull.
PCR of GFP with preffix and suffix and PCR of GFP that can couple to pfu.
Result: only PCR product: GFP preffix suffix was succesfull.
Emeraldo
Sub-culturing the transformats colonies on LB agar plates
Nisa
Promoters-pigment cloning into pSB1C3. Molarity ratio plasmid:DNA insert = 1:3.
Promoter used in this step: fnr and lacI
Pigment used in this step: lycopene, amilCP, amilGFP
Ligation was done for 2 hours in room temperature before continue to E. coli transformation.
