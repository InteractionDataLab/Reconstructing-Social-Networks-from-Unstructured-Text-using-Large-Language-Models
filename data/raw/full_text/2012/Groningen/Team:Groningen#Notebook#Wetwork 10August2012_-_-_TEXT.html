E.Coli with alsT promotor and GFP (colonies: 150-1, 300-1, 300-2, 300-3, 300-4) were grown o/n in m9 medium, illuted to OD=0.1 and grown for 2.5 hours. Samples were prepared of OD=0.05 and divided in 96-well plate. GFP fluorescence was measured o/n.
Result:
No GFP was seen for all the samples.
Renske
Made minimal components medium based upon Jon's modeling data ("Jon's broth")
Glucose: 10 g/L
Potassium: 0.2 g/L
Glutamine: 0.1 g/L
