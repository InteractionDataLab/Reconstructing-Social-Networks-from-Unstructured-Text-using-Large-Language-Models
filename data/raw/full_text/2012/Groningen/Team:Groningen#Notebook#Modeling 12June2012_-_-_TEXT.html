Started research into metabolic control analysis (MCA). FBA has limited potential as,     (1) it may only indicate a increase or decrease in lycopene production due to the wide range in fluxes,     and (2) it would require precise concentration measurements as a starting point.     So, MCA may...may...offer a more accurate description of the pathways.
