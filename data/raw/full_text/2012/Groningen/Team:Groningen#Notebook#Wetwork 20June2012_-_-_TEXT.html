Bacillus 168 strain provided by Jan-Willem Veening. Grown overnight on LB agar plate at 37C.
Plasmid isolation of bacillus backbone for chromosomal integration (BBa_K090403, size: 5632 bp) and terminator biobricks (BBa_B0020 and BBa_B0012, both size: 2058 bp) using the Roche High Pure Plasmid Isolation Kit.
Plasmid concentrations after isolation:
> BBa_K090403: 50.8 ng/uL, 260/280 = 1.85
> BBa_B0020: 93.5 ng/uL, 260/280 = 1.84
> BBa_ B0012: 60.0 ng/uL, 260/280 = 1.93
