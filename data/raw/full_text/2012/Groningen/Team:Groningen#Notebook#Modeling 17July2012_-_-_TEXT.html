Simulations are running to see the effects of glutamine and potassium uptake rates on biomass. Using this data and growth curves from the lab     I shall be able to estimate the actual uptake rates. Then I can finally produce some realistic biomass curves.
For now, here's a plot which shows that B. subtilis can use glutamine as a carbon source and continue to grow, according to the model anyway.
