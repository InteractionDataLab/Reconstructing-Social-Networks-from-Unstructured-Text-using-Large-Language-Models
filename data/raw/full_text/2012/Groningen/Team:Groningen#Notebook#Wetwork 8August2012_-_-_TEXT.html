Tom
diluting O/N ecoli culture with alsT promotor (150, 250, 300, 500) + GFP in LB to OD = 0.1. Grow for 2.5 hours. Dilute to an OD of 0.05. Place different liquid cultures in a 96 well plate for fluorescence GFP measurement.
Result-> Measuring GFP in LB is not possible. Try again in m9 medium.
Elbrich
Phusion PCR reaction with violacein DNA, BBa_K274002.
Nisa
Ligated fnr and lacI promoter with pigment(s) coding region and introduced the ligation product into E. coli DH5a
List of transformation:
- lacI promoter + amilCP (blue)
- lacI promoter + amilGFP (yellow)
- lacI promoter + lycopene (red)
- fnr promoter + amilCP
- fnr promoter + amilGFP
- fnr promoter + lycopene
*) lacI promoter was induced by 0.2 and 0.5 mM IPTG
Arjan
GC-MS: liquid injection of rotted meat volatilles using Hexane, Dichloromethane and methanol as organic solvents. on both HP-1 and HP-5 column. These runs were done overnight. The gotten data was analyzed the next days.
