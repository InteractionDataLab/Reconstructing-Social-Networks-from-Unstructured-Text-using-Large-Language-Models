Micro-array preparation
cDNA purification
degradation of mRNA:
*added 3 ul of 2,5 M NaOH to reverse transcription mix (ran overnight)
*vortexed, spinned down
*15'37 degrees Celsius
*added 15 ul 2 M HEPES free acid
*mixed by pipetting up/down
purified cDNA using NucleoSpin Extract II columns.
Qualitycheck with nanodrop.
Results:
*Fresh_0207A: 274,3 ng/ul
*Fresh_0207B: 247,2 ng/ul
*Bad_0207A: 232,9 ng/ul
*Bad_0207B: 42,9 ng/ul ------> not enough (treshold = 60 ng/ul).
*Fresh_0307A: 249,8 ng/ul
*Fresh_0307B: 241,0 ng/ul (but low quality)
*Bad_0307A: 249,8 ng/ul
*Bad_0307B: 69,9 ng/ul
kept all cDNA in -80 freezer. repeated cDNA synthesis for Fresh_0307A, Bad_0207B, Bad_0307B
NEW POSSIBLE BACKBONE! Also for biobrick submission
Nisa/Emeraldo
1.) After discussion with Jan Willem about our critical situation in the backbone problem, we found new backbone that can be used for B. subtilis: integration plasmid with double crossover on SacA gene, cm resistant (B. subtilis) and amp+cm resistant in E. coli. We have to engineer this backbone to be biobrick ready by adding prefix and suffix + terminator in the MCS.
2.) O/N the E.coli containing the new plasmid(pSAC-CM) for plasmid isolation tomorrow.
3.) Preparation for B.substilis transformation: Molgen method and Team Edinburgh method; Tomorrow: transform B. subtilis with pSac-CM and BBa_I742123 with two different methods.
