We found one tiny red E. coli colony (hopefully) containing pSB1C3-fnr promoter-lycopene. This colony will be checked further with PCR (Fnr forward primer-lycopene reverse primer) after plasmid isolation.
The other transformation showed pink-white E. coli selection, where pink colony implies pSB1C3-gene insert from iGEM Groningen 2010 and white colony implies the disrupted iGEM Groningen 2010's gene and hopefully it was reverted to our gene construct. Based on this knowledge we took 4 white colonies from each transformation plate, subculture it, and the plasmid isolation will be executed on the next day.
