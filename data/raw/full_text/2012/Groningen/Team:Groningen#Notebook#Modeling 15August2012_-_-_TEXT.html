Jason Papin (supervising author of the idFBA article) and Erwin Gianchandani (PhD student who developed idFBA)     have both agreed to help development of the organism-wide model of B. subtilis. As Dr. Papin     is the supervisor for the University of Virginia iGEM team, we will collaborate. He will offer some     of the idFBA scripts, and we will offer something of their choosing.
