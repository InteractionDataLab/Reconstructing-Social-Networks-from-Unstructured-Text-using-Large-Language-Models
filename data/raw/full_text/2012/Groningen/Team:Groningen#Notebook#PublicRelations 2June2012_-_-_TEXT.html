Night of Art & Science
For lunch, we met team TU Delft 2012. We had a short, but nice talk about our projects which are both on olfaction by micro-organisms!
After that, Renske, Jon and Wlada prepared some posters for the Night, and at 19:30 it started. From that time until 02:00, Tom, Wlada, Elbrich, Arjan & Renske explained their project, the beauty of micro-organisms, the use (or not) of washing your hands and more to many of the 4000 people walking around in the Aa-church.
