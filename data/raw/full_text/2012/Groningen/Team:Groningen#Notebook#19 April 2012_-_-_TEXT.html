Team:Groningen/Notebook/19 April 2012
From 2012.igem.org
Weekly meeting
Only two topics left: food spoilage detection and early stage disease detection in urinals. We split up in subgroups to find more literature, especially on: reporter systems, receptor systems and detectable compounds, choice of chassis, originality.
Presentation from Emily (Calgary iGEM team)
Emily Hicks joined our weekly meeting to tell us about her team and to see if we can collaborate. It was really nice to hear from someone how she experienced iGEM in the last years. We hope we can help each other in the next months!
