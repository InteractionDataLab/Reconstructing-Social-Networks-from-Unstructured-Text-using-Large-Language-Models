Found a paper containing glucose and CO2 uptake rates:
Roelco J. Kleijn, Joerg M. Buescher, Ludovic Le Chat, Matthieu Jules, Stephane Aymerich, and Uwe Sauer,     "Metabolic Fluxes during Strong Carbon Catabolite Repression by Malate in Bacillus subtilis,"     Journal of Biological Chemistry vol. 285(3), pp. 1587–1596, 2010
However, still missing the relation between the glucose uptake rate and temperature.
Also missing rates for glutamine, potassium, oxygen.
