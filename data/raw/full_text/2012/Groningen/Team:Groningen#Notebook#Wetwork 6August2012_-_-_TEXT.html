Emeraldo
Another attempt on inserting the terminator with biobrick suffix and prefix inside pSac-Cm MCS. Terminator+prefix and suffix PCR, cut both original pSac-Cm and PCR product with EcoRI and HindIII, ligation reaction, and then E.coli DH5alpha transformation.

PCR alsT (150, 250, 300, 500) + GFP construct with taq-polymerase.
Restriction analysis for alsT (150, 250, 300, 500) + GFP with ecoRI.

Counted TAMC plates + analyzed results:
Arjan
GC-MS
Did liquid injection of rotten meat volatiles using methanol as organic solvent on the HP-5 column only. This methode yielded a spectra with multiple peaks and database reference match.
