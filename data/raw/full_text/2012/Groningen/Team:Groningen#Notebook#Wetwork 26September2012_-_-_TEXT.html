Repeat of growth experiment with and without rotten meat: Bacillus subtilis with SboA-AmilGFP was grown for 12 hours. Controls: AmilGFP with strong promoter rrnB, Wild type & SboA-AmilGFP not subjected to meat.
We checked the color of the pellet and OD at dedicated timepoints. Also checked fluorescence of AmilGFP with microscopy.
Results: Our construct works! It's much more fluorescent than the others and the pellet is supersuper yellow! Check out the construct page for results.
