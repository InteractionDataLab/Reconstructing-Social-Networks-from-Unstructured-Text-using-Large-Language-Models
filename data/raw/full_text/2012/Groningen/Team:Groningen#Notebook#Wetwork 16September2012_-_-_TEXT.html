Result of B. subtilis transformation: some colonies appeared slightly blue-ish on the plate (from construct pSac-Cm sboA+amilCP). The other B. subtilis appeared white/yellow. List of B. subtilis containing volatile detection construct that we now have:
1. pSac-Cm sboA+amilCP
2. BBa_K823023 sboA+amilGFP
3. BBa_K823023 sboA+lycopene
4. BBa_K823023 fnr+lycopene
B. subtilis that had not grow yet were incubated further for 18 more hours.
