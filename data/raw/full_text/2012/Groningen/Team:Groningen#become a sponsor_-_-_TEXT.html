Information for our Supporters
The University of Groningen supports our team and our participation at the iGEM competition.     Thus a lab, laboratory supplies, some enzymes and three advisors are provided by the university.      We already got a lot of support from several sponsors which let us realize almost all  parts of our project.     However the costs of traveling to the World Championship in Boston are not covered yet.     So please support our team and become a sponsor!     In return we will promote your company throughout the whole competition – starting immediately  at the     Boston Jamboree and until the GBB symposium in 2013.
Contact
If you are interested in becoming our sponsor please contact our treasurer Wlada Poljakova via
