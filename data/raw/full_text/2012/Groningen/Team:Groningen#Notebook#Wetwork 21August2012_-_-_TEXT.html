Tom
Restriction analysis of previous obtained alsT 150, 250, 300, 500 and Fnr combined to GFP with EcorI. Incubation time was two hours at 37 degrees celcius.
Result: None of the combined promotors with GFP resulted in the correct size band.
Emeraldo
Cut AmilGFP, BBa_K274110, and pSac-Cm+terminator with EcoRI and PstI, run on the gel and excised the correct bands (the AmilGFP band was not detected). Ligation reaction for cut BBa_k274110 and cut pSac-CM+terminator. Transformation of E.coli DH5alpha with the ligated product.
Arjan
GC-MS: blank runs of the three organic solvents used
Nisa
PCR for checking the construct pigment
result: PCR result was ran in an agarose gel. The result showed multifragment DNA which can imply multi-annealing temperature for every PCR reaction. We cut the DNA fragment with the correct size and purified it.
