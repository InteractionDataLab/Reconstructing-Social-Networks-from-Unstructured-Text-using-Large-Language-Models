Chemical test. B. subtilis with the construct: psaccm-SboA-AmilGFP was incubated with tridecanoic acid, hexadecanol, ethyl-benzoyl formate and benzoic acid. These components were detected in gc data. None are soluble in water so no sollutions could be made. Incubating small portions of these compounds resulted in some growth but nog pigment formation.
