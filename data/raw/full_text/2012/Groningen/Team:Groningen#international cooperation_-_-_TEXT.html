iGEM Cambridge
At the European Jamboree we got in contact with the Cambridge team. Since they work on Bacillus subtilis too, we have quite a few things in common. Cambridge uses the magnificient ability of our favourite bacterium to form spores to store their sensor system.
Since the Cambridge team had trouble with their sporulation protocol, we provided the Cambridge team with our protocols and some tips & tricks for sporulation. Luckily this gave them higher yielding spores in the last weeks! We also were really happy to discuss the topic of germination with them.
Characterization of B.subtilis plasmid backbone created by iGEM LMU Munich 2012
The iGEM team LMU Munich 2012 has developed a plasmid backbone that is suitable for gene expression in B. subtilis (BBa_K823023).     This plasmid backbone contains an integration locus in amyE, which means that after being transformed into B. subtilis,     the cloned insert will be integrated with the B. subtilis genome at the amyE locus. B. subtilis is known for its     starch degrading ability and amyE is a gene responsible for the starch degradation phenotype in B.subtilis by regulating a-amylase production.
We characterized this plasmid backbone by doing a growth experiment on a starch agar plate. B. subtilis strains (168 wildtype, pSac-Cm, and K823023, clockwise respectively) were inoculated in LB agar+0.4% starch and incubated overnight     in 37oC (left picture). After the addition of 0.1% iodine, a clear zone was formed around B. subtilis wildtype and B. subtilis strain containing pSac-Cm. There was no clear zone observed around B. subtilis strain containing backbone K823023 (right picture).
The inability of the B. subtilis strain containing BBa_K823023 to degrade starch has demonstrated that the amyE locus in    the B. subtilis genome had been replaced. Apart from this characterization experiment, our team has been using BBa_K823023     as a plasmid backbone for our volatile detection device in B. subtilis sboA-lycopene .

TU Munich iGEM 2012
We participated in the survey of the iGEM TU Munich and are very proud that we got their original Bavarian Collaboration-Medal.
iGEM Uppsala
At the beginning of August we received the chromoproteins amilCP (blue), amilGFP (yellow) from iGEM Uppsala 2011 .     We were able to transform their BBa_K592009 and BBa_K592010 behind our identified promoters into E.coli and managed to turn B.subtilis into blue and yellow, which has never been done before!     For the latest results, check our Pigment page .
After the European Jamboree, the Uppsala team sent us the red chromoprotein eforRed (BBa_K592012). Although we could prove succesful cloning into our plasmid psac-cm connected to our promoter PsboaA, into E. coli and Bacillus subtilis by restriction analysis, there was no visible expression of the protein.
Dutch iGEM teams (iGEM Wageningen, Amsterdam, Delft, Eindhoven)
All of the Dutch iGEM teams collaborated to create an iGEM presence at the Discovery Festival on Friday 28 September     in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Eindhoven. We will aim to get the public in touch with Synthetic Biology in a playful way.
Besides these Dutch iGEM meetings and the Discovery Festival, we also collaborated with Wageningen and Amsterdam on a molecular level.     Many times our transformation of E.coli failed, so we ran out of the backbone biobricks for B. subtilis. Luckily Wageningen     and Amsterdam were so kind to provide us with some of their bricks. Thank you guys!
iGEM Calgary 2012
Emily Hicks from the winning Calgary iGEM team in 2011, and now member of iGEM Calgary 2012, has studied in Groningen during her exchange period.     She was very interested in her iGEM Groningen colleagues; therefore we asked her to give a lecture about her previous iGEM experience.     We were really motivated by Emily's suggestions concerning medal requirements, information about wiki etc. Thank you Emily!
iGEM Virginia
Prof. Papin, supervisor to the iGEM Virginia team and supervising author to the idFBA article, graciously shared his knowledge and scripts relating to     idFBA.
