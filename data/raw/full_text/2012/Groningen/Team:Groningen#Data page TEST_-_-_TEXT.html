Data For Our Favorite New Parts
BBa_K818000 - Integration vector: integrates into the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis at the SacA locus and replicates in Escherichia coli; derived from vector psac-cm ( Middleton et al., 2004 ).
BBa_K818600 Rotting meat sensor system: contains the native Bacillus subtilis promoter PsboA ( BBa_K818100 ) and yellow chromoprotein amilGFP ( BBa_K592010 ) with RBS ( BBa_B0034 ); PsboA is strongly activated by volatiles from rotten meat when B. subtilis grows exponentially. Produces a visible yellow color in six hours.
Data For Pre-existing Parts
BBa_K592010 Yellow chromoprotein amilGFP ( Uppsala 2011 ): stable, non-toxic pigment, well perceptible in the visible and fluorescent spectrums. We are the first to characterize the working of the part in Bacillus subtilis.
BBa_K592009 Blue chromoprotein amilCP ( Uppsala 2011 ): pigment  visible by eye. We are the first to characterize the working of the part in Bacillus subtilis.
BBa_823023 Integration vector ( LMU Munich 2012 ): integrates into the Bacillus subtilis chromosome at the AmyE locus and replicates in E. coli. We confirmed that it works.
We've Also Characterized the Following Parts
BBa_K818100 Promoter PsboA, rotting meat sensor: natively activates production of the antibiotic compound biosubtilosin; weakly constitutive expressed at exponential growth, strongly upregulated when subjected to volatiles from spoiled meat.  Identified by transcriptome analysis of B. subtilis subjected to volatiles from spoiled meat.
BBa_K818400 Rotting meat sensor system: promoter PsboA ( BBa_K818100 ) and blue chromoprotein amilCP ( BBa_K592009 ) with RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). Visible blue/purple color is obtained when using our sticker system .
