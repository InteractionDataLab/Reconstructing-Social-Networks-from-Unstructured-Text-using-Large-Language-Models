Night of art and science
Elbrich and Renske met Renske de Jonge, coördinator from Science Linx, to talk about the Night of Art & Science. This is an event on the 2th of june where artists and scientists show their work to the whole city of Groningen. We would love to show iGEM to everyone there! Renske de Jonge is very enthousiastic, it was a nice brainstorm session. To be continued....

Modeling lecture by Jaap Oosterbroek (iGEM 2011)
Jaap told us about modeling for iGEM, the bottlenecks and the challenges. Of course we also talked about what iGEM Groningen 2011 did, and brainstormed a bit about possible topics.
