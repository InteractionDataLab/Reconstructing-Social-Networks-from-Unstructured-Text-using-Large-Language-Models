There are clear goals for the FBA analysis:
1. Create a quantifiable relationship between the concentration of volatiles in the medium and the lycopene concentration.
2. Create a quantifiable relationship between the concentration of volatiles in the medium and gene expression.
Is this feasible within our timeframe? This article draws some doubt. If B. subtilis can so quickly adapt to the environment,    then the FBA is only valid for very short timesteps, hence requiring a dynamic model.
