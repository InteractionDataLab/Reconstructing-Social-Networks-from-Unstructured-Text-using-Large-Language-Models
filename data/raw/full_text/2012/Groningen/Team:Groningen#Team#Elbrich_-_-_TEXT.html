name:
Elbrich Hendriks
duty:
Team Leader
bio:
Elbrich just finished her Bachelors in Molecular Life Sciences at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen.          Now, she'll start her Master Bio-Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Leiden.
role:
If you want to know her role in the iGEM Groningen 2012 team, you'd best ask what she doesn't do for iGEM.         A summary of what she already performed: labwork, fundraising, bio-art painting, giving presentations,          arranging weekly iGEM Groningen meetings and worklists, keeping track of what everybody is doing, etc.
further:
Elbrich was born in Friesland, the province next to Groningen.          There won't pass a day without her saying things in Frysian and she can spot Frysian flags from far distances.
It giet der mei de fioele yn en it moat der mei de knyptange út.
