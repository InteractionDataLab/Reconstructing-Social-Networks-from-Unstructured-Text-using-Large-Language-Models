Arjan/Renske
Slide images were analyzed using ArrayPro 4.5 (Media Cybernetics Inc., Silver Spring, MD). The obtained data was processed and normalized (Lowess normalization) using the MolGen software MicroPrep (Garcia de la Nava et. al, 2003). A statistical analysis was done using the webservice CyberT (Baldi et. al, 2001) A gene was considered differentially expressed when the Bayes p value was lower than 0.001 and the difference in expression (the fold) was >2 or <-2. The genes obtained using the CyberT analysis were ordered by locus tag and fold. This list was processed further using different analysis tools. With use of the in-house software Genome2d (Baerends et. al, 2004), operons with expression difference were identified and figures showing these operons were made.

Nisa/Emeraldo
Double restriction of the biobricks isolated on 11-07-2012 with EcoRI and SpeI.
GFP primers recieved
E.coli Dh5a transformed with 30 ng/ul PDRIII GFP optimized (MolGen). The PDRIII has Apicillin resistance and spectinomycin resistance. For E.coli Amp + Spec, but for Bacillus subtilis only Spectinomycin because Ampicillin resistance is cleaved by double cross over (genomic integration plasmid).
