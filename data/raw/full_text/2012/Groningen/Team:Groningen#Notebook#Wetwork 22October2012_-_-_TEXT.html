Done growthcurves for the modeling the whole day. Duplo experiments with Bacillus subtilis transformed with BBa_K818600 at room temperatue, 30 degrees Celsius and 37 degrees Celsius
Plasmid isolation from yesterday's O/N culture, cut with EcoRI and PstI for length check (psaccm-wapA-eforRed, psaccm-wapA-amilGFP, psaccm-sboA-eforRed). The correct sizes were then transformed into B. subtilis. Transformants were then plated on chloramphenicol LB plates.
