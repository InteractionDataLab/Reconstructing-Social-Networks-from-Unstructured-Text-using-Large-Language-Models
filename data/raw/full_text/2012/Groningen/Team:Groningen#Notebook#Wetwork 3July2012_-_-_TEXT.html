Micro-array harvest experiment (Arjan/Renske)
Experimental duplo of 02/07. Cells harvested and kept in -80.
Nisa/Emeraldo
1.) Linearization of: BBa_K274100 (red pigment), BBa_K274002 (violacein-violet pigment), BBa_K090403 (amyE integration plasmid), BBa_R0062 (luxR promoter), BBa_J37034 (luxI, GFP added). All of them are in correct length except the integration plasmid (expected)
2.) B. subtilis transformation using BBa_K090403 and BBa_I742123 by Ruud from Molgen group (to compare with our work)
