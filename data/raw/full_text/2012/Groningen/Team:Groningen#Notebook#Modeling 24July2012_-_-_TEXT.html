Tom ran multiple experiments to observe the effect of temperature on generation time on SMM.     Based on his data, the following relationship is given for starting OD between 0.103 and 0.106.     When the starting OD was greater than 0.3, there was no doubling. The biomass hit a limit. As such,    a curve cannot be created as there are more factors at play at that starting OD.
