Micro-array: RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Isolated RNA from the harvested cells (Badmeat/Freshmeat 02/07 & 03/07) using:
*Macaloïd method
*Roche High pure RNA isolotion
Quality check with Agilent bio-analyser and nanodrop
Results nanodrop:
*Fresh meat - 02/07: 4458,6 ng/ul; 260/280 = 1,09
*Bad meat - 02/07: 3667,0 ng/ul; 260/280 = 1,97
*Fresh meat - 03/07: 4353,9 ng/ul; 260/280 = 1,54
*Bad meat - 03/07: 3630,2 ng/ul; 260/280 = 1,96
cDNA synthesis (in duplo (named a/b in the rest of the notebook)) using the following mixture:
*Fresh meat - 02/07: 3,4 ul sample; 12,6 ul H20; 2 ul random nonamers
*Bad meat - 02/07: 4,1 ul sample; 11,9 ul H20; 2 ul random nonamers
*Fresh meat - 03/07: 3,4 ul sample; 12,6 ul H20; 2 ul random nonamers
*Bad meat - 03/07: 4,2 ul sample; 11,8 ul H20; 2 ul random nonamers
*mixed, 5' 70 degrees Celsius.
*10 min RT
*on ice
Further with Reverse transcription using the Superscript III reverse transcriptase kit
*18 hours, 42 degrees Celsius (O/N)
Emeraldo/Nisa
1.) B. subtilis transformation failed (as reported by Ruud)
2.) Our BBa_K090403 is not good. Find alternatice source of this biobrick!
3.) Ask about B. subtilis transformation from Edinburgh 2007, the team that submitted BBa_I742123
4.) Digestion of BBa_I742123, BBa_K274100 (red pigment), and BBa_K274100 (voilet pigment) with SpeI and EcoRI for later ligation to backbone.
