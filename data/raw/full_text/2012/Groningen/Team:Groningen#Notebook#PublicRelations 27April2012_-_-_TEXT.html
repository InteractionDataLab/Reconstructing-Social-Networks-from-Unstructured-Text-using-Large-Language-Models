Summer school plans
Continuation of the plans for the summer school in collaboration with ScienceLinx. It will be combined with the Noorderzon festival; and will be a combination of information and labwork for the students; and maybe even a mini iGEM competition for fifth grade highschool students. A meeting with a subgroup who'll work out concrete plans will be planned soon.
