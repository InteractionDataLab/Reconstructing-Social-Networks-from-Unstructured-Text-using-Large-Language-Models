Renske
Started Total Aerobic Microbial Count of our minced meat. According to ISO4833 (European Norm, January 2006), minced meat is allowed to contain in max. 2 out of 3 samples between 10^5.7 en 10^6.7 CFU per gram meat.
Used pre-weighed meat samples, bought on 19th of July and stored in -20 degrees Celsius. Taken out all meat samples at the same time, incubated at room temperature, and measured the TAMC at time points 0:00, 3:00, 5:00, 7:00 and 24:00.
TAMC measurement
Suspended 1 g of meat in 100 mL of Trypton Soya Broth (Sigma, pre-made, heated to 37 degrees Celsius).
Diluted suspension 10x, 10^2x, 10^3x, 10^4x. Put 100 mL of the suspension on Trypton Soya Agar plates (triplo), did the same for all dilutions. Put plates in 37 degrees Celsius.
Emeraldo
