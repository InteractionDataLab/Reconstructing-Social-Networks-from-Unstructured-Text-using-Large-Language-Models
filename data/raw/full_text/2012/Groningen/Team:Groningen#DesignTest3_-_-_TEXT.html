Their natural genetic response to the rotting gases of meat has been identified and linked to a pigment production system. In this way, a consumer can easily see when the meat is spoiled: it's rotten and you know it! read more
Now in the lab
With the iGEM deadline being just four weeks away, the lab is now always occupied in order to make the Food Warden work. The newly identified genes in the running to become our PBADmeat promoter are ready to be tested, the pigments are waiting to be transformed. But Bacillus biobricks are tricky things... read more
