			Our construct idea is simple and effective: there will be a production of pigment under the regulation of a rotten-meat reactive promoter. 
			When <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> senses the volatiles from the rotten meat, the rotten meat promoter becomes active thus allowing the 
			production of downstream genes. We placed pigment genes under the control of the promoter so that the pigment would be produced
			when the promoter is activated.

			We use our <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> backbone (BBa_K818000) that has <I>sacA</I> and a chloramphenicol resistance gene for chromosomal integration
			and antibiotic screening of transformants respectively. This backbone also has <I>E. coli</I> origin of replication, so it can be amplified inside 
			<I>E. coli</I>.
			<Z2>Update! (26th October 2012)</Z2>
			After the European regional jamboree, we were back in the lab to build our planned constructs in the
			<A class="inlink" href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Groningen/in_development">development page</A>.

			sboA-AmilGFP was shown to be very weakly expressed in <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> on LB plate (faint color formation after 2 days). 
			This is probably due to the leakiness of the promoter. We tested the expression of sboA-AmilGFP in <I>B. subtilis</I> subjected to
			volatiles from spoiled meat using the same setup as we used for the microarray. Firstly, we inoculated <I>B. subtilis</I>SboA-AmilGFP and
			<I>B. subtilis</I>Wildtype from plate into flasks of  Luria Broth subjected to <Z5>spoiled meat</Z5> and <Z5>without meat</Z5>. 
			We grew <I>B. subtilis</I> containing sboA-AmilGFP device in the setup overnight (16 hours) at 37 degrees Celsius. In the picture below, you can see the result:
			<I>B. subtilis</I> sboA-AmilGFP strain that was subjected to spoiled meat had turned bright greenish yellow (even visible in liquid LB culture), 
			while the same strain that was grown without meat only showed very faint yellow color. Both <I>B. subtilis </I> wildtype in this setup did not express 
			yellow color at all.

			To check whether the difference in color was not the result of the promoter activation by the presence of meat in general, we also compared 
			the growth of <I>B. subtilis</I> sboA-AmilGFP strain subjected to fresh meat and rotten meat. We grew the strain in Luria Broth in the microarray
			setup for 12 hours and measured OD (600 nm), absorbance (395 nm) and assayed the color of the cells when pelleted. Below you can see the results: 
			while grown without meat volatiles and with fresh meat volatiles, our device strain still produces yellow color. The color was produced faster 
			and in a larger amount when the device strain was subjected to volatiles from spoiling meat.

			shows the difference in fluorescence after twelve hours. It is clear that in the presence of volatiles that produced by the spoiled meat, the sboA promoter
			was highly upregulated, thus more amilGFP was expressed.
			Previous tests showed that the intensity of AmilGFP expressed by <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> sboA-AmilGFP strain that was exposed to fresh meat was the same as

			AmilCP is expressed less strongly in <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> than AmilGFP. On plate, not induced by volatiles, a faint blue-greyish color is visible after 
			5 days of incubation. In liquid culture, it is not visible without induction by spoiled meat volatiles.
			However, after placing <I>Bacillus subtilis</I> in our sticker and exposing the sticker to rotten meat volatiles, it turned into a clear purple color.

<Z2>Update! (26th October 2012)</Z2><Z3>Quantification of P<I>sbo</I>A expression by flow cytometry</Z3>
To further characterize the difference in amilGFP expression under the P<I>sbo</I>A promoter, we measured the fluorescence of amilGFP (ex = 470 nm, em = 514 nm) by flow cytometry. We let our strain grow in the presence of spoiled and fresh meat for nine hours. As showed in the figures below, a clear difference in fluorescence can be seen after six hours of incubation.
We observed that the fluorescence intensity is also slightly influenced by the growth speed of the bacterium: the slower growing culture âfresh 2â (see pictures B and C) has a lower expression of amilGFP compared to the faster growing culture âfresh 1â. However, this difference can be neglected when compared to the difference of the cultures subjected to fresh and spoiled meat while having the same growth speed. This confirmed the importance of finding ways to control the growth of the bacterium inside our sticker by <A class="inlink" href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Groningen/Modeling">modeling</A>.</P><P class="caption">
