Tom
PCRed the different promotors alsT 150, 250, 300, 500 and Fnr to GFP.
Result: None of the pcr products contained the desired product. It is not sure if this is due to wrong primers or not appropriate working taq polymerase.
Emeraldo
Cut the pSac-Cm and purified terminator PCR product with EcoRI and HindIII. Cut pSac-Cm was run on the gel and cut at the correct cut size and purified from the gel. Ligation of cut pSac-Cm with cut terminator and then transformation of E.coli DH5alpha with the ligation product.
Nisa
