Limitations due to time constraints
We chose to make our construct at 37 degrees. If this project leads to  a proof of concept, a psychrotrophic bacterium like Bacillus cereus could be used as a chassis instead of Bacillus subtilis. This bacterium is however a much harder to engineer and, unlike Bacillus subtilis, harmful.
