All the work for this project was performed by the iGEM Groningen 2012 team members, the lab work started from May 2012 onwards.
The original Bacillus subtilis integration vector pSac-Cm from which we derived our backbone biobrick originates from the article by Middleton et al. [1] and was provided     by Dr. Jan-Willem Veening from the Molecular Genetics group of the University of Groningen, as was the GFP optimized for Bacillus subtilis for our testing constructs, the Escherichia coli dh5a strain and the Bacillus subtilis sp. 168 strain we used in the lab.
The idea of the Food Warden was developed by the team before the labwork started. All experiments, the modeling and the    sticker design were planned and carried out by the team. Directions were given by our advisors, but they     only had a consultative function.
We were informed by Marius Uebel about GMP/SOP and data management with the use of acronyms. The team also took care of     the sponsoring and all the other organizational issues. We made our own logos, drawings and wiki/presentation/poster style.     The picture gallery on the home page and in other sections of our wiki has been made using the hoverbox image gallery code by Nathan Smith as a basis.
Last but not least, we wanted to add an extra feature to the wiki, by providing everyone with an exact copy of the iGEM server for use     on a local hard disk. Each team can immediately see the versions of all the available libraries now. Click here .
