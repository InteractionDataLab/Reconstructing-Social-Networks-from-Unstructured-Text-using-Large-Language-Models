Upcoming Presentations
iGEM World Championship Jamboree
- 2-5 November – MIT, Cambridge (MA), USA – link
We are looking forward to show all the iGEM teams from Amerika and Asia our great presentation!
Previous presentations
iGEM European Jamboree
- Saturday 6 and Sunday 7 October – VU, Amsterdam – link
We performed our presentation twice during the European Jamboree: during the presentation sessions and as an iGEM finalist!
ESF EuroSYNBio conference
- Thursday 4 October – Het Kasteel, Groningen – link
EuroSYNBio is a programme of the European Science Foundation. It aims not only to stimulate research in the field of synthetic biology, but also discusses the role of synthetic biology in society. That is why we were very proud to get the opportunity to present on this conference. The comments we got, were very positive and showed that the audience was very interested in our iGEM project.
And it was also nice that we met iGEM Wageningen again: we invited them a long time ago to practise their presentation also during EuroSYnBio. We hope it helped Wageningen to achieve the Best Presentation Award during the European Jamboree!
Dutch iGEM symposium
– Wednesday 3 October – University of Eindhoven – link
On Wednesday 3 October all Dutch iGEM teams were invited to present their projects. Together with Wageningen and Eindhoven, we watched each others presentations and shared ideas on the upcoming European Jamboree in Amsterdam!
Transnatural Conference
- Tuesday 18 September - NEMO, Amsterdam – link
On Tuesday 18 September we managed to get out of the lab and into the Science Exhibition Centre Nemo.     It was a great learning experience to present for an audience without a scientific background.
GBB symposium
– Thursday 6 September – Hampshire Hotel, Groningen – link
At the annual conference of the Groningen Biomolecular Science and Biotechnology institute, we got the chance to give a lecture about our project     and present our poster.
Dutch iGEM mini symposium
– Monday 9 July – University of Wageningen – link
On the 10th of July all Dutch iGEM teams met in Wageningen for the first mini-symposium (Greek for meeting and having a drink together).     We shared our ideas and presented our work so far.     See the video Symposium iGEM Netherlands 2 (posted on July 9 2012).     The iGEM Groningen presentation starts at time point 1:42.
After these interesting talks, a nice dinner was served: we had a BBQ inside the chemistry lab of an old school building. Very suitable for us lab rats!
Biomedical Engineering Symposium
– Wednesday 13 June – UMCG, Groningen – link
The study society of Biomedical Engineering annually organizes a conference for students and researchers at the University Medical Centre of Groningen.     This year, the theme was “Bright Ideas”.
