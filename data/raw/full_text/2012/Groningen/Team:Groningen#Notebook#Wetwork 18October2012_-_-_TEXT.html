Plasmid isolation from the O/N culture of the transformants. All of the plasmids were cut with EcoRI and PstI to check for the inserts' length. Only the eforRed plasmids showed the correct insert's bands. The eforRed band was then purified from the gel and ligated into Psaccm. The ligated product was then used to transform E. coli DH5alpha, plated into ampicillin LB agar for O/N 37 degree incubation.
