Building an organism-level model of B. subtilis is not possible at this moment in time.     There is simply not enough information on the signaling network and its ligand binding rates.     I met with Matthias to discuss what to do next; he suggests focusing on making FBA and the mathematics     behind the modeling more accessible to the public.
