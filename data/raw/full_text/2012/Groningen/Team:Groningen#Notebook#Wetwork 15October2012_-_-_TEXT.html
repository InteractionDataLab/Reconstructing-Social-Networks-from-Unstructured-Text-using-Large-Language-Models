Tests were done with the construct psaccm-SboA-AmilGP with rotten and fresh meat in duplo. Samples were obtained every hour and plated in three different dilutions. Cells were measured for OD (600nm) and color (395nm). Cells were spun down and resuspended in sz. The resuspended cells were analyzed with flowcytometrie.
