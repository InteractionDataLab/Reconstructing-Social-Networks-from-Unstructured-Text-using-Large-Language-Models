Arjan/Renske
Repeat of the test of 21-09-12. We innoculated the medium with a colonie of the plate and took a sample every hour. To keep the meat fresh we replaced the ice every 2 hours. Of the samples we measured the OD(600), pellet color and the absorption at 395nm to characterize the pigment. Further we tested the construct with no meat and used WT B. subtilis (fresh meat and no-meat) as control. The SboA+aGFP strain showed a yellow color after 12 hours, the no-meat and WT controls showed no color.
