name:
Emeraldo Jo
duty:
Lab Worker
bio:
Emeraldo is doing his Masters in Molecular Biology & Biotechnology at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen.
role:
Together with Nisa, he's our senior lab member, having the most experience. He's inventing cloning strategies and constructs.
special lab skill:
He is very good at reading genetic map, finding tubes in the -80 degrees Celcius, working in the middle of the night, and fixing the enzymes freezer door.
further:
From his picture, the uncropped version anyhow, you can see that he is a sport addict and an adrenaline junkie. We love his Sunday meatballs treat! This guy is such a good cook!
When he sits behind his laptop he cheers us up with the most beautifull tunes such as: the pink panther, beat it and of course WHAT IS LOVE, BABY DON'T HURT ME, DON'T HURT ME, NO MORE.
