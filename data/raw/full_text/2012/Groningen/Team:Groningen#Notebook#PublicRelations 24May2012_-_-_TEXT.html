Pouring the agar plates for the night of arts & science
Five iGEMmers, Leen van Wijngaarden and Renske's sister together produced twelve liters of TY agar and poured it into the "petri dishes" for the Night of Art & Science (six plates of 60 x 40 cm, one of 1 x 2 m).

And we look cool, of course!]]
