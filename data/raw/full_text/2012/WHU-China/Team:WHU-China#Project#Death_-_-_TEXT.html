Death Device
Outline
We plan to place endonuclease and YhjH gene downstream the xylR repressed promoter to make bacteria die and lose their adhesion when exposed to xylose.
Description
In order to terminate the overreaction of fatty acid metabolism and cellulose synthesis, we design an elaborate device. Firstly, we determined to use endonuclease YhjH responsible for c-di-GMP degradation to counteract the impact of AdrA and BglII(BBa_K112106), a protein that can kill the microbe without inducing cell lysis. Since AdrA but not YhjH contains this restriction site, our E.coslim will lose their adhesion more easily. To control the expression of endonuclease and YhjH, a regulator is   necessary. We selected xylose as the inducer because this monomer hardly exists in nature, so the GMOs will not be killed under natural condition. Also, it is healthy and hard to be absorbed by human beings so the concentration of xylose in the gut can keep high for a long time. We are planning to device another synthetic promoter repressed by XylR from B.subtilis. We hope that eating xylose will   subsequently derepress the expression of endonuclease and YhjH, ending up with the loss of adhesion and the death of our E.coslim.
Forestalling HGT
In human gut, there are billions of microbes. Horizontal gene transfer of those high efficient metabolic genes between GMOs   and normal intestine residents may get out of control and cause disastrous effects. Therefore, a mechanism to prevent HGT   is highly necessary. To prevent horizontal gene transfer, we designed a two-plasmids system. In one plasmid, xlyR repressor encoding gene from Bacillus subtilis will be assembled with constitutively expressed promoter. On the other plasmid, metabolic gene will be coupled with xylR repressed death system. In   our GMOs, since death system is suppressed by xylR in low xylose concentration, the bacteria will not die. However, when   the HGT of those high efficient metabolic genes happens, the death system will not be suppressed, and the recipient will   be killed.
