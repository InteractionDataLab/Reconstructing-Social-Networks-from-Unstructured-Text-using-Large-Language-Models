Colonization Device
Purpose
One big challenge of probiotics is their survival in intestine. We respond to this challenge by expressing gene adrA responsible for manufacturing the second messager c-di-GMP, a magic molecule that leads to inhibition of motility and increase of adhesion and division of E.coli.
Outline
AdrA protein can convert GTP into c-di-GMP, a magic second massager that, besides promoting the production of cellulose(for more details, see our celluose synthesis device), can reduce the expression of flagella and acute virulence gene simultaneously. In the same time, c-di-GMP can facilitate the synthesis of various adhesins and exopolysaccharides and can promote the proteolysis of replication inhibitors. As a result, AdrA makes cells become adhesive and promote the formation of biofilm, making the bacteria gain advantages to survive in the hostile environment of intestine.
Experimental Procedure
We tested the function of AdrA gene by plate assay. Formore details, please visit our protocol page.
