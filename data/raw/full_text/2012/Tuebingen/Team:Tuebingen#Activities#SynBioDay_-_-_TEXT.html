Synthetic Biology Day
The Synthetic Biology Day is an initiative by all German iGEM teams. It is a public event with the intention to explain and communicate the field of Synthetic Bilogy to the general public. It was held on August 25, 2012 in the following cities: Bielefeld, Darmstadt, Frankfurt, Göttingen, Marburg, München and Tübingen.
Event
townhall in background
Propagating synthetic biology in a town like Tübingen is a delicate business. Tübingen's inhabitants are known for their very ecological and organic lifestyle. So when we set up our pavillon at 8 am, we were prepared for the worst. Thanks to the sunny weather the cafés around us opened early and the first deserted marketplace got filled continuosely.
A group of bikers stopped by to have a glass of our free iced tea. They were the first to try their knowledge on our synthethic biology quiz, most questions only needed a little help to be answerd correctly. Throughout the day we had kids enjoying iced tea and sweets, watching their parents discussing topics such as the impact of genetic engineering on agriculture and medicine.
"What happens when I eat a gene?"
"How can microorganisms be controlled?"
"Do we need genetic engineering to feed the world?"
We provided answers to all these questions and were happy to see that most of our visitors were thankful for the information we provided.
