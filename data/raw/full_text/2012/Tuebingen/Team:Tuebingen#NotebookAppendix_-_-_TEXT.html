Software
The following list of software was used in the team:
Unipro UGENE
UGENE is a free open-source cross-platform bioinformatics software. We used it to construct and annotate all needed sequences, search for restriction sites and visualization.
Vector NTI (commercial)
All our primers were designed using Vector NTI which is also used by our advisors.
BLAST
BLAST was our main sequence search tool. It was quite useful for controlling sequence results.
ApE
The free and useful plasmid editor.
Google Drive
Google Drive was used for our documentation and all of our collaborative work (papers, poster, images).
