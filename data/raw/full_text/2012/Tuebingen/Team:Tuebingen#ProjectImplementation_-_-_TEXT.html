1.4 Measurement
The following plasmid constructs are needed to implement the measurement system. Using two receptors, two signalling systems and two reporter genes the implementation contains redundancy to select for a sensitive system.
Plasmid 1
Task: Expression of membrane receptor.

Measurement
The measurement itself should be limited to an optical one.  With this idea in mind, we decided for reporter genes like lacZ and luciferase, because these produce signals which can simply be quantified by optical measurement methods.
