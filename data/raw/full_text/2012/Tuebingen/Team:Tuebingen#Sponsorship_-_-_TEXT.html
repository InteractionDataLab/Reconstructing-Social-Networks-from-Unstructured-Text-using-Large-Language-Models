Sponsorship
We like to thank our sponsors for enabling us to continue our project. They all have proved their interests in fostering research in science even during academic studies.
Projects like ours are crucial to enhance life quality for all of us. Based on our project, we would like to find a simple method to measure endocrine disruption in aquatic environments. We hope this will contribute to further research in this topic in future. All of the ones listed below hope so too and have joined us on our path.
