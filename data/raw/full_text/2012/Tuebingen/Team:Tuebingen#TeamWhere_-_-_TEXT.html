Where we're from
Interfaculty Institute of Biochemistry, location of our labs
We study at the Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen which has plenty of course of studies in the Humanities and Sciences. It goes back to the 15th century and was home to many famous poets and thinkers.
Located in Tübingen is also the past laboratory of Friedrich Miescher in Schloss Hohentübingen where he discovered the nucleic acids (Nuclein) in 1868.
Nobel laureate Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard is Director at the Max-Planck-Institut für Entwicklungsbiologie (developmental biology), her work with Drosophila melanogaster and zebrafish Danio rerio greatly improved our present-day understanding of embryonal developement.
Neckar
We come from the beautiful city of Tübingen , located in Southern Germany on the Neckar river. Tübingen is home to approx. 25,000 students, among the 85,000 citizens. Furthermore Tübingen is the city with the lowest average age of Germany.
Tübingen is a location of several research institute, such as:
Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics
Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology
The Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of the MPG
Last but not least the university maintains the Botanischer Garten , where a rich variety of plants from all over the world grows.
So don't hesitate and spend a day or two in our wonderful and young city on your next trip to Germany.
