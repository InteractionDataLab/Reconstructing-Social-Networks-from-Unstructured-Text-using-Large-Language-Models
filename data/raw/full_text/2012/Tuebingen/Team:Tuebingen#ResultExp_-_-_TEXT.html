Experience
We have come a long way since we first met to form a team and discuss possible projects. We learned how to make an idea into something big, that we can really accomplish things with motivation and hard work, how to use a lab without continual instructions and most of all that as a team even disappointments lead to a stronger commitment concerning the project.
We had a great time with iGEM, made new friends, met people from all over Germany and we are looking forward to meet even more in Amsterdam and in the coming years.
