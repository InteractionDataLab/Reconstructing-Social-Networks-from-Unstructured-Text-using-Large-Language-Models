Acknowledgment
Our project would not exist in this form without the support of the University of Tuebingen as an institute that not only taught us the basics we needed and showed us how much fun science is but also gave us the financial support for our own scientific adventure.
Especially Dr. Apel and the team of Prof. Jansen helped us out throughout the whole process with ideas, a lab, material, expertise, supervising and believe in us. Prof. Nordheim and Prof. Kohlbacher were important contact partners for a wide range of obstacles in organization and administration that we would not have been able to overcome without them.
We also want to thank the Reinhold-and-Maria-Teufel-Stiftung and Prof. Oecking for helping to finance our trip to the Jamboree in Amsterdam.
