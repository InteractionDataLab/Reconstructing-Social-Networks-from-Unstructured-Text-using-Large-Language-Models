Protocols
Ligation
Ligation is performed with a ration of 1:5 plasmid backbone : Insert . The Ligation mix is incubated for at least 10 min at room temperature or for at least 1 hour at 16°C before the ligase is heat inactivated at 65°C for 20 min.

Native-page acrylamide gels were made with the same composition, just lacking SDS and stacking layer. Also, native gels contained an acrylamide top to bottom gradient of 6 - 20 %.
Cell Lysis
Lysis Buffer (Tris 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, EDTA 5 mM, pH=7.4)
Spin down 1 mL of liquid culture
Resuspend in 1 mL of lysis buffer
Add lysozyme to a concentration of 1 mg/mL
Freeze cells in dry ice for 30 min
Thaw the cells and centrifuge at 4°C
Use supernatant for testing
Miller Assay
Z Buffer (NaH2PO4 40 mM, Na2HPO4 60 mM, KCl 10 mM, pH=7)
Add 4mg/mL of ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-Glactoside (ONPG) just before useage.
20 µL cell lysate is dissolved in 180 µL of Z-Buffer with ONPG. ONP activity is measured in a 96 wellplate at 420 nm every minute over a time period of 10min. β-Galactosidase activity determined based on the slope of the measurements.
TECAN plate reader Sample preparation
5 mL of fresh LB containing necessary antibiotic resistances was inoculated with 50 µL of overnight culture and grown at +37 °C while shaking vigorously. After cell density reaches OD600 ~ 0.1-0.2, 1 mL was withdrawn and mixed with IPTG. Then, three 200 µL samples were taken and transferred into sterile 96 well plate (Thermofisher scientific, Denmark) and used for data analysis as a triplicate. Cells were later grown in TECAN Infinite 200Pro plate reader (Switzerland) at 37 °C, while shaking in orbital mode with 5 mm amplitude. Each 15 min fluorescence (excitation at 488±4.5 nm, emission at 530±10 nm; 25 flashes and integration over 20 µs) and cell density (absorbance at 600±4.5 nm; 15 flashes) measurements were taken.
Single Cell analysis using flow cytometry
For sample preparation the OD600 was measured to gauge the volume for sample-taking ensuring similar cell-concentrations for each measure. Cells are harvested and resuspended in an appropriate amount of Phosphate buffered saline (PBS). It is possible that the cells has to be diluted later because the flow is too high due to high concentration.
Measurements were performed in the BD LSRFortessaTM using following lasers and filters:
SSC and FSC: 488 nm - 488 nm/10 nm
GFP: 488 - 530/30
excitation: 488 nm
emission: 530 ± 15 nm
mRFP and mCherry: 561 - 610/20
YFP: 488 - 542/27
eCFP: 445 - 473/10
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
The HPLC was performed with a ... column.  Sample preparation: Cells were lysed in acteonitril incubated for 15 min on ice and then centrifuged for 30 min at top speed.  The supernatant was applied onto the column.
HPLC Method:
Column (preheated up to 40 °C) was equilibrated with 92% A and 8% B
50 µl per sample were applied to the column
The proportion B was increased linearly to 50% in 7 min. The last 3 min it is increased to 100%.
Buffers:
A: Water , 0.1% formic acid
B: Methanol, 0.1% formic acid
Purification of TetRDBD-UVR8-HisTag
Cells, expresing TetRDBD-dUVR8 with 7xHis tag at the C-terminus under Ptac promoter, were grown overnight in the 100 mL of LB media at 37 °C without IPTG induction. Culture were then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4°, supernatant discarded and cells were resuspended at 10 mL of Lysis buffer (50 mM K-PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM Imidazol) and lysed with 1 mg/mL lysozyme at room temperature followed with rapid freezing in dry ice and kept frozen for 1h. Cells then were thawed and incubated for another hour with DNase and frozen as before. Cells debris were removed by centrifugation and supernatant was loaded on Ni ion affinity chromatography column, washed with lysis buffer containing 50 mM imidazol and eluted with 50 mM K-PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazol. Elute was concentrated and diluted 1:1 with glycerol and stored at -20 °C.
