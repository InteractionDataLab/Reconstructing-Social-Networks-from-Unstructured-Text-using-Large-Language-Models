Circuit Design
Fig. 1: Circuit for Decoder.
The presence of blue or red light leads to the activation of LovTAP and to the deactivation of Cph8, respectively. As a result the expression of lacI and tetR being controlled by the tryptophan repressor promoter and the red light promoter is terminated.
The intermediate NOR gate represented by PL TetO/LacO is only active in the absence of TetR and LacI and controls pabAB, the formation of the violet pigment and cI. cI ensures that the other ouputs are repressed.
For the two cases where only one light-input is present merely one hybrid promoter is not repressed leading to the formation of the red or green pigment.
Hybrid promoters
Fig. 2: Conserved regions of PR and PL.
In our case we want the decoder ( construct 1 construct 2 )  to have NOR logics. Therefore we designed 3 different hybrid promoters (all in all 4 variants), all of them derived from the λ-phage promoters PR and PL [Cox2007]: <partinfo>BBa_K909011</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K909012</partinfo>, <partinfo>BBa_K909013</partinfo> and <partinfo>BBa_K909016</partinfo>. Each hybrid promoter is repressible by two of the following three transcriptional repressors LacI, cI and TetR. Only in case neither of the two repressor is present, transcription of genes underlying the control of the hybrid promoter can start.
PR derived promoter
The region upstream the -10 region of the PR derived promoters was conserved while the operator site of TetR or LacI was incorporated upstream to the -10 region [Kinkhabwala2008].

PR with Lac operator sites
We decided to test two variants containing Lac operator composition with
Modified PR promoter with operator sites OR1,OR2 and LacO1 .
Modified PR promoter with operator sites OR1,OR2 and LacO1/O2
PR with Tet operator sites
Modified PR promoter with operator sites OR1,OR2 and TetO2
PL derived promoter
Fig.4.: PL promoter repressible by TetR and LacI.
The -35 and -10 regions of the PL derived promoters were conserved while the operator sites of TetR was incorporated between the -35 and  -10 region and the LacI binding sites downstream the -10 region. We decided to test two variants of that specific promoter. They differ only on the Lac operator composition.
3. Modified PL promoter with operator sites TetO2 and LacO1
Output: PABA
We constructed one pab operon consisting of the pabA and pabB/C gene from Lactococcus lactis to overexpress PABA. Therefore we used the biobrick parts BBa_K137055 and BBa_S04039 as a template to construct the wished composites.
Biobrick BBa_K909014 will be used to show that PABA is produced. In that case  the pab operon is controled by the constitutive promoter J23100 while the BBa_K909015 operon can be cloned downstream to any promoter. We will clone the ladder operon downstream of the PL promoter with operator sites TetO2 and LacO1 to incorporate the pab genes into our system.
