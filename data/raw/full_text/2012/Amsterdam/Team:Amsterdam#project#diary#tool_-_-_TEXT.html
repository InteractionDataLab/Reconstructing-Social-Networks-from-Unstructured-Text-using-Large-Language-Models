7th of August 2012
The tool now also has the minor things that were not yet added but essential in store.
Creates a seperate memory plasmid gb file and a restriction site plasmid gb file.
Been debugging and cleaning up the code for hours and hours and hours *yawn*
The tool should be in beta by the end of the week
Only thing essential still missing is an (automaticly generated) list of mtases and zf's
Next week we can start with dressing up the tool for extra features such as primer generation / cloning steps

We have a working tool that generates a genbank file given a backbone plasmid. The next few days will have to be spent to automatically and correctly insert the features that are to go with our memory plasmid.
Adjusted the tool so it correctly makes all the objects and it's sub objects / functions
25th of Juli 2012
Had a meeting for our plasmid design tool establishing the rules for the plasmid generation
