Software
StochPy is a versatile stochastic simulation package implemented in Python for the simulation of biochemical networks. Its inherits the easy to learn model description language MDL from its parent package PySCeS , which is a modelling environment with deterministic capabilities. By defining models in MDL and executing them through high-level commands in the Python or IPython shell, an easy-going experience is presented to the modeller in which one (almost) doesn’t need to worry about implementation details.
MDL2LaTeX is another step towards making a modeller’s life as carefree as possible. Exactly as its name implies: it converts MDL files to clean LaTeX representations, so the models can be easily integrated into reports. No more time wasted on tedious equation copying into LaTeX!
Installation
MLD2LaTeX has been tested in both Linux and Unix (Mac OS). For easy installation, first install git .
Then run:
git clone https://github.com/slagtermaarten/MDL2Latex.git
If you can’t access git, simply go to this MDL2LaTeX github page and download and extract the .zip.
Usage
Edit the
Makefile
inside of this folder and change the pscfile variable to filepath of the the .psc (MDL model) file you want to convert. Save and run
make
