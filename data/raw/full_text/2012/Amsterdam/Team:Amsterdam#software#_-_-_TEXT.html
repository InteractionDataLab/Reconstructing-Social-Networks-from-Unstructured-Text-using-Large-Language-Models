Software
The complexity of biology calls for the aid of computers in a synthetic biology design process. Over the summer we have created a range of useful applications to make the life of the synthetic biologist easier. One of them, the Logbook Designer, is directly related to our project. Others have been designed for general usage in synthetic biology, iGEM and modeling.

Logbook Designer
The Logbook Designer is a webtool that allows for easy and quick Cellular Logbook plasmid design. Upon parts selection it gives all the related genbank files, a graphical overview of the plasmids and an algorithm that can compute which sensors have come to expression given the gel electrophoresis band sizes.

MDL2LaTeX
MDL2LaTeX (MDL-to-LaTeX) converts MDL stochastic model description files used by the stochastic simulation package StochPy to LaTeX representations, so they become more human-readable and can be easily integrated into reports.
