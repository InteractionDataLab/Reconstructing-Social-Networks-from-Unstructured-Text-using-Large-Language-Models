Demonstrated the functionality of M.ScaI introduced in E. coli
Succesfully sensing, writing and reading of an arabinose signal
We developed the theory behind inferring the time of signal registration by way of a model
We devised grounded suggestions on how to improve the molecular design of our system using a model
We developed software that is able to generate a Cellular Logbook plasmid that enhances our project in such a way that it can be used on a bigger scale
We designed and outlined a new responsible development-approach for iGEM projects and applied it to our Cellular Logbook
As part of Human Outreach we collaborated with Dutch iGEM teams to organize part of the Discovery Festival in 3 major Dutch cities
