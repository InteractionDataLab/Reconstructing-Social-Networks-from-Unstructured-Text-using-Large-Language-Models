Here we use a stochastic simulation to replicate the experimental results and do suggestions for improvements to the molecular design.
Introduction
A lot of transcriptional regulators can accomplish drastic behavioural changes in just very small amounts/low concentrations.
Replication of experimental results
Possible improvements
Usage of tighter promoter Upregulation of repressor
