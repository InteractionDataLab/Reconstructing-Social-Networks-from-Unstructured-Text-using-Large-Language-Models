Abstract
Medal requirements
Multi-sensing genetic devices offer great future perspectives for biotechnology, environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics. In light of this we have created an innovative DNA-Methylation based reporter system in E. coli, named Cellular Logbook, that has the potential of simultaneously reporting on significantly more signals than current fluorescence-based systems (eg. GFP). The Cellular Logbook can be used to detect and store the presence of any compound linked to a transcriptional regulator. This system allows for offline monitoring by functioning as a memory module. Assessment of the memory status is performed by digesting with restriction endonucleases followed by gel electrophoresis . Furthermore, the Cellular Logbook is able to infer the time of signal-onset or signal-intensity using the natural dilution of the registered signal’s due to cell division. In short our exciting new memory module could potentially be utilized as a platform for many groundbreaking technologies.
