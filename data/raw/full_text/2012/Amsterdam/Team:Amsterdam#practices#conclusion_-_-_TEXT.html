Human Practices: Conclusion
What did our Interactive iGEM research approach add to the development of the Cellular Logbook?
By applying this approach we learned to think about different issues concerning our project from different perspectives.
We developed the idea of a memory system in bacteria into a complex molecular design build on feedback from experts in biotechnology.
Inspired by our talk with an innovation manager we further investigated possible applications for the Cellular Logbook.
Discussions with stakeholders in potential fields guided our project toward its most relevant innovations within the field of biosensors.
An interview with a National Safety Officer learned us about the potential harm of PHGPs. This gave us the opportunity to think about a relevant risk assessment early in the developmental process of the Cellular Logbook.
This is what we have achieved in terms of public perception of SB, by engaging in a dialogue during Discovery Festival.
Note of attention
The developmental phase of the Cellular Logbook is of course far from finished. We will continue to reflect on our actions and to engage possible stakeholders in further developing our product. The context of the project is always changing and we will attempt to be responsive and shape our technology in the right way. In other words: we are relishing the opportunity to make new steps in the interactive development of the Cellular Logbook! There is only one way that can make this happen: by making it to Boston!
