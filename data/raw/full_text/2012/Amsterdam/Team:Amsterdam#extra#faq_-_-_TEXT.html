Frequently Asked Questions
Why not use a fluorescent protein?
Using a fluorescent protein has its advantages compared with the Cellular Loogbook on the other hand the Cellular Logbook also has advantages compared using a fluorescent protein(FP). The main advantage of the Cellular Logbook is that  there is no limit to expandability. Spectral characteristics of FPs limit their expandibility..
Won’t endogenous methylation cause interference?
E. coli posses several endogenous methyltransferases which are used for epigenetic purposes of E. coli’s own genome. Our scan of these endogenous methyltransferases does not indicate that any of them posses the ability to bind to our M.ScaI-recognition site and are thus they are not able to methylate the detection site.
Will the fusion-protein fold correctly or be processed by E. coli’s native systems?
At the moment there is no indication that this will be the case. Separately the parts of the protein have been translated and expressed in E. coli without complications.
Will the introduced methyltranferase cause problems inside the microorganism?
Right now all our experiments are conducted in the DH5alpha strain of E. coli which does not posses the M.ScaI methyltransferase we use. Actually the M.ScaI is a type 4 methyltransferase, that does not occur naturally in E. coli. After BLAST searching the E. coli genome we also did not find any potential binding site for our M.ScaI.
Won’t the memory plasmid be cut or processed by the endogenous restriction enzymes?
The chosen restriction sites in our plasmid are not recognized by E. coli’s endogenous restriction enzymes. The plasmid backbones and vectors that are used have all been previously used or expressed in E. coli without any complications.
If there is leaky expression of the protein, would this cause interference?
Replication creates a progeny without a logged signal, eventually you would lose the logged signals. This perspective differs in  system specific applications. If something is being sensed that continues to activate the sensors linked to the system this is not a problem. If the sensed compound is not degradable this is also not a problem. If a time-indication based sensing is done the loss of logged signal to the progeny is actually a desired phenomenon. The choice of high- or a low-copy plasmid can influence the amount of progeny methylation. In the case of using a high-copy plasmid there will be enough of the fusion protein divided during replication to keep the progeny methylated.
How much specificity is created by the Zinc-finger?
The Zinc-finger uses an unique 18 bp sequence which is not found anywhere else on the plasmid or in the genome of E. coli. The Zinc-finger multiplies the overall probability of binding (PoB) to a much higher specificity when being attached to the M.ScaI which has its own PoB.
Would constitutive active promoters cause random or unspecific methylation?
This is fine-tuned and/or dependent on the conditions that the experiment is being done in. Factors contributing in this are; the degradation time of the fusion protein, high or low copy plasmid and the amount of different sites present. If the degradation time is really fast then a constitutive active promoter is desirable. If the degradaton time is slow then this is unwanted. When using a low copy plasmid it  could be desirable to use a constitutively active promotor, when using a high copy plasmid t this could be unwanted.
When is choosing between a high or low copy plasmid the best approach?
If the intention is to store the occurrence of something for a longer period the best approach would be to choose for the high-copy plasmid.
In the event of a time-concentration storage a low-copy plasmid would be preferable since there is less chance of the progeny receiving any Mtase during replication.
What is the degredation time of the fusion protein?
The time of fusion protein degradation depends on the three parts of which the fusion protein is composed of. First of all the degradation of the methyltransferase is the main part which will cause loss of function when degraded. The issue of methyltransferase degradation is the most critical to answer this question regarding fusion protein degradation. The Zn-finger would, when degraded, only lower the specificity of the fusion protein and enable the M.ScaI part to bind in random places.
The Myc-linker part would also create an unfortunate circumstance when degraded by releasing the Mtase into the cytoplasm for free binding at random sites.
