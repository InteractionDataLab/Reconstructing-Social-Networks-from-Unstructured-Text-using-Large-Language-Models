iGEM Amsterdam: Cell Logbook
Bacterial populations in their natural form are very capable of storing, processing and acting on stimuli in their environment. Exploiting these properties in the pursuit of massively parallel computation would be the next logical step.
The first thing one needs when constructing a computing device is memory to store the results onto. In order to meet this demand we present the cellular logbook which is usable to reliably store whether a signal was detected in E. coli's environment. Discussing even such additives as a time span correlation of its life duration. Expanding this straightforward molecular mechanism, multiple signals can be stored with the prospective of storing up to 64 bits on a single plasmid. With even in future prospective, complex cellular behavior to be programmed according to the memory status of the cell by way of introducing additional modules transcriptionally controlled by the introduced memory plasmid..
