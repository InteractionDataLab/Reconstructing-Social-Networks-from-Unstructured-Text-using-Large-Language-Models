Personal statement
Reading is a wonderful journey of my life. It’s fantastic to experience different life in books. Another way to enrich my life is to travel. I feel good when I wander in different cities or even in the same city at different time. However, I’m not always a quiet girl. Sometimes I get crazy. For example, I get excited when Novak is playing a tennis game; I get moved when a beautiful story is going on; I get angry when somebody cheats me. All the emotions make me a real person.
Lab is a place of magic. In the lab, we exhibit the world of biology in various ways and then it becomes a 3D or even 4D picture. It never ends and it can be better. Biology changes me a lot. I really want to do something to know a little more about the world and improve the world. Life is tough now. It’s time to deal with cancer and diabetes. I will rise to the challenge.
I enjoy IGEM because we work as a team when it’s going on. We are never alone. We brainstorm. We argue. We fail. We insist. It’s never too late to have new ideas.
Come on, boys and girls. It’s our time now.
