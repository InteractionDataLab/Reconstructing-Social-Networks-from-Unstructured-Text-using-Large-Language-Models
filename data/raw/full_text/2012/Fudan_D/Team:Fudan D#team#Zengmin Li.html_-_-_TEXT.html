Personal statement
You can know from my intersts that I have the "potential" to become a otaku.But become of the lab,I change it.The regular life make me feel fresh.
The reason why I join the iGEM is that I appreciate the the spirit of exploration and marvel at the natural world's regularity but also diversity.During the experiments,the most impressive to me is that there is a  crack between the theoretical knowledge and the real practice.I believe "No practice, no gain in one's wit."
