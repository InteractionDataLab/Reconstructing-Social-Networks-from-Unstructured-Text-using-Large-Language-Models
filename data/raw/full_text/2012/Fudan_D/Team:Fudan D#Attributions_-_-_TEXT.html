Attributions
The whole project should be attributed to the undergraduate students of Fudan_D iGEM team.
Chao Zhang, the great team leader of Fudan_D iGEM team, took a lot of effort in the team organization and human arrangement.He participated in both the design and the experiment of the project.
Xiang Zhao and Xiaoting Zhu focus on checking the reporter genes. They constructed the functional truncation fragment and tried to find the best reporter through experiment
Taijie Jin and Hankun Li took efforts in getting the overly length telomere sequences, which is the spirit of our project.
Yancheng Zhao, Jie Cao and Yu Ye talked about the potential usage of the nuclease as a molecular switch in the “artificial telomere system”, with the experimental help of Yilai Li and Yichang Liu on the construction of the nuclease.
Jie Cao was also in charge in the human practice of the team, together with Yu Li, Zhihao Guo, Wentao Chen and Zengmin Li, designed the “iGEM ABC” dictionary.
Wei Ning designed the fantastic wiki page and keep updating. He took charge in making the poster, logo and PPT. He also took pictures of team members and experiment.
Duo Xu takes charge in the social website like twitter and facebook of our team. She did good job in the communication with other iGEM teams.
Kangyun Dong and Zhongcheng Wang took part in the brainstorming and discussion of the project. They were responsible for the financial affairs and the travel arrangement.
Haotian Guo and Chen Dan participated in the brainstorming and discussion of the project, taking up good suggestion. They made effort in constructing the luminarycyanobacteria , which is a backup project for Fudan_D and the future iGEM team. DAN Chen also explored the possibility in inducing the Cre-LoxP system into the telomere for biosafety.
Wei Wei is in charge of the “IGEM Association”, an interesting club about synthetic biology, cooperating with Fudan_D team in Human Practice program.
