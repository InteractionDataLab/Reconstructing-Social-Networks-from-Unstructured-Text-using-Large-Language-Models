ATTRIBUTIONS
2012.9
Recorded BY Chao Zhang
Week 1: The majority of Human Practice was started including iGEM dictionary information collection and application making, game design and iGEM Association recruitment. We also cooperated with the radio station of Fudan University to have a brief introduction for synthetic biology and iGEM. At the same time, The part construction continued.
Week 2: Wiki design, poster design and their material preparation were begun.
Week 4: Wiki was completed and we begin to prepare for the presentation and poster session in Asian Jamboree.
2012.8
Recorded BY Chao Zhang
Week 1: Synthetized the ribozyme and substrate sequence. Then the experiment group started to link the two parts with an interval sequence (about 600bp). The paper-reading group started to look for the design information of yeast intron.
Week 2: We extracted the yeast genome DNA successfully and continued the ligation of the ribozyme-related sequence.
Week 3: Finished the synthesis of 150bp highly repetitive TG-sequence and began to construct the 450bp, 600bp telomere sequence. The intron design was completed.
Week 4: During the week, we amplified the GAL4 homologous arm and TRP1 gene by PCR and got the yeast ADH1 promoter and EYFP (yeast codon-optimized) from iGEM kit. Then this part of construction was begun. The overlong telomere was completed (450bp and 600bp).
2012.6-2012.7: experiment preparation
Recorded BY Chao Zhang
During the month, we started to prepare our experiments including vectors and parts we may use. Meanwhile, we tried to master some special techniques needed like telomere PCR. The detailed sequence design of ribozyme and its target substrate is also determined by the paper-reading group.
2012.4-2012.5: Brainstorm
Recorded BY Chao Zhang
Week 1: Every member talks about his or her interests. We argue together to pick up several candidates for further discussion.
Week 2: 5 candidates are picked up and all members are divided into 5 groups. Each group is responsible for one possible project. We mainly focus on creativity analysis and feasibility analysis. Each group gives a presentation about its own project.
Week 3-4: We pick up 2 from the 5 candidates after presentation. We are divided into 2 groups and further analyze the creativity and feasibility. Each group gives a basic project based on the topic.
Week 5: After argument and discussion, we have our final topic and basic project. Our team is divided into several groups responsible for different assignments. One group is responsible for paper reading and project modifying. Another is responsible for experimental study. The other is in charge of contacting and asking for experimental materials.
2012.3-2012.4: Case Study & Paper Study
recorded BY Kangyun Dong
Every week, we have 3 students to give presentations showing good projects that other schools have ever done and good synthetic biological papers.
Week 1:
Case 1: 2011 ZJU biofilm
Case 2: 2011 Tsinghua
Case 3: 2011 Yale
Paper: Microbefindsarsenictasty; redefineslife
Week 2:
Case 1: 2011 CUHK
Case 2: 2011 Slovenia
Case 3: 2011 John Hopkins
Week 3:
Case 1: 2011 Imperial College London
Case 2: 2011 Sweden Uppsala
Case 3: 2011 USTC
Week 4:
Case 1: 2011 SJTU
Paper 1: Synthesis of three advanced biofuels from ionic liquid-pretreated switch grass using engineered Escherichia coli
Paper 2:A synchronized quorum of genetic clock
At the same time, we collect unfamiliar words related to synthetic biology and prepare to create a specific dictionary.
2012.3: Recruit members
recorded by Kangyun Dong
We interview all the candidates in Room 107 of school of life science. After careful consideration, we recruit over 20 students.
