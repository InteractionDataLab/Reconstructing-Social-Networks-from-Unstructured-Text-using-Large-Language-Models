Every little helps a mickle.
What’s my job in the team?
The main job of mine in the team is to read papers! Though it seems rather ‘boring’ thing, diversities of papers really help us to construct a fairly full framework, which gives innovative ideas and strong supports to the project. Also, I am ready to do some simple experiments when necessary.
About my lab experience
I am now working in a molecular biology lab, doing research in the cell division. Always willing to learn from my experienced mentors, I really love the rigorous environment in the lab. As the saying goes, ‘In doing we learn’, there comes a lot of knowledge and benefits through failure. Yeah, that’s true, ‘lifeless, faultless’. It is the same to our iGEM team. Nevertheless, to cooperate with those iGEM fellows has another kind of experience, full of passion and fun.
Know more about my interests
Though as a student of science, I am not a dull girl, for I often play crazily with friends! Volleyball and badminton are my favourite sports! Also, immersed in classical music, I play violin in my leisure time.
