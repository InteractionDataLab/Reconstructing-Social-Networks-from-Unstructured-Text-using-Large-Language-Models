Smile to the life.
Self-introduction:
Enjoy the time fighting for a goal.
Enjoy the time contemplating to overcome the difficulties.
Enjoy the time doing experiments day and night.
Enjoy the whole time with my teammates.
I’m Chan Zhang from Fudan_D, Shanghai, China. This is my second time taking part in the iGEM. Although   both the project and the teammates have changed, I believe something remains constant. That’s our passion for synthetic   biology. Thus, look forward to meeting with all of you guys in the Jamboree.
