Personal statement
You must be curious about my name. Yes, please believe your eyes, my name is Xu Duo indeed, and it is the exact word “many” in Chinese. You can simply call me Erica to avoid a long and tedious explain. Although I’m not focus my research interest in synthetic biology, all the skills I have learnt in my research can be applied in this competition, we have to admit that genetic engineering made it possible for us to try to explain enigmas in almost every field of biology. And after knowing more about the synthetic biology, it turns out to be a very attracting field.
Also I’m excited about going to Hong Kong for the competition, since people always use “dynamic” to describe Hong Kong, this time I can have the chance to experience the “dynamic” in academic field myself. I’m honest, friendly and patient, so I am willing to make friends with you. Let’s make this contest a wonderful memory together.
