There are no secrets to success. It is the result of spending every minute wisely when waiting for PCR !
Self-introduction:
I am a senior student ready to spend my last year in Fudan University. Well…if I were asked what is most attractive for me to join the iGEM team, I will say making “machine” sounds cooooool when I first heard the name of this competition (jk~). As a member of “paper group”, a few other people and I were devoted to search for useful information from a great amount of articles, kinda nice job for an introverted guy like me.
Besides iGEM, I am working in another lab focusing on the genetic diseases, and from there I gained a lot of passion leading me to explore more thoroughly into the world of genes.
I like synthetic biology. It is exciting to brainstorm with friends about the new ideas or to think independently about a new model. Thanks to all the teammates and I love u all !
