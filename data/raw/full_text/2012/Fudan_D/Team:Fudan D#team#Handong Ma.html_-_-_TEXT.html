iGEM: I Gotta Enjoy, Man!
Now working in a bioinformatics lab, I am delight to see the data coming into reality. But I must admit to actually bring something into reality is hundreds of times harder than let it stay in our imagination. Though it costed me hundreds of hours reading paper, thinking and working, it has been my greatest pleasure for the recent half year constructing the whole idea, developing every possibilities, solving all the problems, cultivating my hope and seeing the project grow.  This is the first time I particpate in this game, and I believe it won't be my last contact with synthetic biology. There is nothing to lose, we are the pioneer !
I enjoy reading, skiing, dancing, swimming, programming, all kinds of ball games, not a typical Bio-guy, I hope to see you guys in USA soon!   handongma.work@gmail.com
