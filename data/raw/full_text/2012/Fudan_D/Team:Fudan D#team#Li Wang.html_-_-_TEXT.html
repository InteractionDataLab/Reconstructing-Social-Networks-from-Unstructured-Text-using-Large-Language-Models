Personal statement
The first time I saw different imaginative programs brought by different schools from all over the world in the IGEM competition , I was completely astonished by the simple but elegant modules and designs of synthetic biology. So it was a great honor for to be a member of Fudan IGEM team fighting all this brutal summer with other brilliant teammates together. I appreciated the logic and seriousness of our main project , and it was also full of wild imagination to introduce telomere into synthetic biology. Just can not wait to share this cool design with your guys in Hongkong.
