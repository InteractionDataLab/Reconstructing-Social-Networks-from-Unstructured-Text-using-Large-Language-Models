What should we answer?
1st Question
What's our understanding about bio-safety?
It is the most important issue !
As a closely relationship between our final project and bio-safety, meanwhile bio-safety is on of the most important part in igem，we paid much attention to this topic. We have had a better understanding of bio-safety after Inquired to some professors and read related papers including “laboratory bio-safety manual” published by NIH and Cartagena Protocol. We think it contains bio-safety problem caused by improper experimental steps and risks of Genetically modified organisms(GMOs). The former indicate injuries to experimenters from mistakes of technique or experimental instruments including the diffusion of dangerous microbes and faults of experiment operation. The latter refers to the potential risks of Genetically modified organisms including bad influences to ecosystem, undesirable evolution and poisonous to human beings. Strict instruments and special training will solve the first problem but the second will be more difficult than the former. except some special laws of this area and experimenters’ self-regulatory, technology-orientated seems a significant mean to reduce the risks, and which may be the best way to ensure the real bio-safety.
2nd Question
What are the possible contributions to bio-safety of our model system ?
Four key points hightlight our project.
We talked about that technology-orientated may be the best way to solve bio-safety problem. But in most papers and information，the technology of biological confinement is simple such as terminator gene，suicide genes and auxotroph. But all of them can not reach the requirement of bio-safety to most engineering bacteria because of the shortage of persistent nutrition providing and tedious steps to suicide. And our model can provide a new system which has these advantages:
1）How to start the system
2）How to feed the engineering bacteria
3）How to control transferred genes
4）And how to close the system.
As a result, we believe that our model have great potential for growth in developing synthetic biology and even future bio-safety problem.
