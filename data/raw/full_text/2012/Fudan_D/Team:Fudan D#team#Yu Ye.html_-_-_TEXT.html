The tragedy of life is not so much what man suffer, but what they miss.
Personal statement
Shortly after I was accepted into the Fudan iGem team Ders, I realized synthetic biology was a changeful world and which was worth to explore more deeply. In my eyes, the theory and application tend to stimulate each other no matter which direction one takes. Working on actual problems can help to reinforce the grasp of cell biology or synthetic biology theory and methods, and it will provide motivation for developing innovative and useful experiences from the experiments on some pre-engineered system.
From this competition, or in an other word, from this game, I gained a lot about knowledge, teamwork, sharing happiness, and keeping a curious heart in bioresearch.
