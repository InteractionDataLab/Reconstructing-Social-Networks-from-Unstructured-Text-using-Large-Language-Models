What do I get from IGEM ?
It's never easy to start the journey of iGEM. The first time we joined this competition last year, we almost learnt from the very beginning and almost set up the lab from nothing. It is a hard but wonderful experience. What we get from iGEM is not only knowledge of synthetic biology, but also the way to solve problems, the sparks of inspiration, and friends. We quarreled for different thoughts and ideas and really felt happy when we got a little progress. This year, with the theoretical preparation and practical experience, we are sure to go much further. Enjoy it guys !
