INSPIRE A GENERATION!

Yichang Liu

To enjoy life science means to enjoy life and enjoy science.
Interests
For music style, my favourite is the folk rock, but I also love choral music and pop. Yoga has been my favourite sport for a very long time, beating Ping-Pong, badminton and swimming, but recently it shows a tendency to be replaced by golf. And I'm also a great food and travel buff, a big manga and fiction fan, and of course, a person enthusiastic in cell biology !
Personal statement
Well, like almost all the stories begin with "Long long ago", my story begins with my dream to become a story teller since long long ago. And I think I've already on my way to it, just a little different with those story tellers in common sense: I'm a story teller in a white gown! And my works are not done on paper or in WORD document, but inside the cells. I have genes as my leading characters, whose relationship with each other make the plot. I have enzymes as the supporting roles to complete the story. And I write my sentences in my experiments. There're love stories, epics, comedies and tragedies happening inside the cells everyday. And this time, with our Fudan-D team workers, I feel so excited to participate in completing this story and can't wait to see the gorgeous ending !
At last, just as my rabbit says, IGEM means "I'm Gonna Enjoy Myself" to me! Hope all you guys in IGEM enjoy yourselves too !
