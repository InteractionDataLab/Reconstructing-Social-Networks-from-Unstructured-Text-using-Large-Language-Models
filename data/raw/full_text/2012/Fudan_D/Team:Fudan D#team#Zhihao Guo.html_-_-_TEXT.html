In doing we learn.
Some of my friends think that I'm a dreamy girl who wants to learn something of everything and everything of something. Luckly，biology easily allows me to get lost in the haze. I also have a vibrant personality and love to communicate and cooperate with other people. When I first knew iGEM，I thought it is high time for me to try something fun. But the deeper I immerse myself in，the firmmer I regard iGEM is an unshakeable goal to pursuit.
