Personal statement
I am interested in many things such as ball games, travelling, but excluding talking and performing which indeed I am not good at, and great zest in science, especially biochemistry and computational biology. As a science student, I revere the nature but also want to make use of it, especially the living creatures, which I think is just a complex organic matter but highly ordering and possessing the soul, therefore, can be divided into parts and be designed and synthesized as we want. Thus I join in the Fudan_D team and participate in the iGEM in order to enjoy the delight of designing and controlling, which at last been turned out to be a tough work! Though difficult to get it, joy is always there when we tried to.
