INSPIRE A GENERATION!
GO BACK TO MEMBERS
Haotian Guo
Sophomore
Dream a little dream, and make the dream come true in this Lab.
Interests
Some people in the lab think my favorite thing is reading papers…. Well, at least, I don’t buy it. I am not only a bookworm but also an enthusiast of classic music, musical, tennis as well as ping-pang, bridge, drawing and Latin Dance.
Research interest
Cell Biology, Theoretical Biology, System and Synthetic Biology
Personal statement
“Hello World!” This is the first time I participate in the iGEM, albeit I have known it from my friend (who took part in iGEM twice) when I was young…..uh, I mean, younger (though at that time I was still always thought to be a married man), and have started to acquire stuffs from the works of other teams before I came to this college.
I Have a Dream. Because of the interest in those works which demonstrate the fundamental rules of the natural world, I always want to do some research to show the basic principles of living things………………..Nevertheless, I join in the iGEM team just for fun, … at very beginning; indeed I started to understand how synthetic biology could help us to figure out those essential mechanism now, and that is why I gradually transform into an avid iGEM “sophomore” from a “freshman” in this summer.
I Love the Environment in the Lab, although without antibiotic resistance it is a little hard to survive – so thank god we are not bugs. I also like to do some theoretical works like modeling……Consequently, it seems that the best job for me is doing “dry” works in a “wet” lab; unfortunately, I doubt whether such career exist.
