INSPIRE A GENERATION!
GO BACK TO MEMBERS
Zhongcheng Wang
Senior
Do what you want, if you have a dream for BETTER.
Interests
I am a outgoing and worm-hearted person who enjoy his life. As a result, I've got a wide range of hobbies. Besides reading various books, especially science fictions and detetive stories, I also love outdoor activities, such as soccer, tennis and cycling.
Research Interest
Ecology, Environmental Biology and Biosafety
Personal statement
As a senior undergraduate student, I'm still a freshman of iGEM programme. I got awareness of the programme from some of my friends, who have participated in the last iGEM competition. Now we become teammates, who all enjoy working together and solving problems.
I join in the team in order to learn something beyond my previous concerns. Which, I believe, is very essential for a 'recruit' in science researches just like me. I hope I can enjoy the process.
