Tout est bien qui finit bien.
Interests
I am mad about musicals especially those writen by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber and have a habit of collecting items related to the Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables. Besides, in order to understand French musicals I learned a little French. Gradually, I am fascinated by this language.
RESEARCH INTEREST
Biochemistry and Synthetic Biology
Personal Statement
This is my first time to paticipate in iGEM. Thanks to Prof. Ding and everyone else in the team, I learned a lot of things that cannot be learned in class.
Look, listen and learn. That is what I did most in the past year.
