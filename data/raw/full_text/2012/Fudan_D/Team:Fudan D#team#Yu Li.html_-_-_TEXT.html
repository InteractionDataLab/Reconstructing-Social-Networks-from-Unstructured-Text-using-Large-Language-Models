Personal statement
I always believe that only if we get to understand the rules of nature, will we know how to deal with ourselves. And this craving impels me to choose biology as my major.When i encountered with iGEM, i find it a world full of marvel. From the beginning, indeed, you will never know what you will create in the end, and that's the most attractive part in iGEM.
