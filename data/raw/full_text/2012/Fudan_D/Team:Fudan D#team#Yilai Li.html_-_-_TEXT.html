You become limited if you set limitations for yourself.
I feel free here because it is said to be a 'free-style' introduction. I majored in biology and my favourite is biochemistry and biophysics and blablablabla...I like reading papers and staying in the lab and I am a good student and a geek...well do you really believe it? You shouldn't !
In fact I am not a model student at all, at least and not that boring. I love drawing, soccer (maybe other kinds of sports too), and metal music. My favourite genre is black metal, especially depressive black metal. I know not so many people have actually ever heard of it, so if you are black metal fan and also an iGEMer feel free to contact me !
A number of iGEMers had some research experience even before the competition no matter where you are from, but iGEM is different in a way that it is a project dominated by ourselves and also needs great cooperation. Science is fun, and it becomes more intriguing when we found that the driving force of the project is our own motivation. One might find it dull to be in the lab and do the same kind of work again and again, but the exciting part is to see the expected and sometimes unexpected results. Also, I feel lucky to be in a group with so many GREAT people ! Good luck !
