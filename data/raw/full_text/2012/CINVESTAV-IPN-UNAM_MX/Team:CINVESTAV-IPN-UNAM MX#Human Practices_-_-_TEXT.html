Human Practices
Sometimes Human Practices work is hard for scientist, most scientist are not worried in solving ethical, legal or social issues. Nonetheless, in a country like Mexico, the human practices work is very important to create the ideal conditions that could guide us to a real development of synthetic biology in short term.
We need education programs, research opportunities, colaboration agreements, biosafety agreements and information resources that provide a foundation for the development of new projects.
Our Human Practices Work we prepare a network including many advances in ethical, legal and social implications, some of the activities are:
Using of administrative tools for project design
Feedback sessions for project redesign
iGEM experience
Synthetic Biology Summer Workshop
Synthetic Biology Science Club
iGEMMX National Meeting for Mexican teams
