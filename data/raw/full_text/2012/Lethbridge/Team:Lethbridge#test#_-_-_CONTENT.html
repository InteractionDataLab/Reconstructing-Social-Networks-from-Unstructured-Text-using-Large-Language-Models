This will be my first year contending in the iGEM competition. I joined the UofL iGEM team to exploit the many opportunities it has to offer. And so far, the program is very rewarding: it allows me to explore an alternative and fascinating field of biology, and provides me with the privilege of working alongside and learning from veteran iGEMers. But enough of the science-y stuff! When I’m not working in the Kothe RNA lab or the iGEM lab, you can find me on the battlegrounds defending the Sanctuary from the Prime Evils or living vicariously through the Game of Thrones series. But aside from the medieval fantasy, I also enjoy hiking, and playing badminton. I’d like to think of myself as a pretty outgoing kind of guy, but really I am socially awkward. By the way, the name’s Alvin Lee.

There I never would have thought this would be the path I would eventually end up on, but one thing lead to another and here I am. I am taking my Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience, and find it a very exciting field, with a great cross application to Synthetic biology. I enjoy camping and hiking in the mountains, I love skiing both downhill and cross country, and have coached youth cross country ski in past years. I had heard about iGEM prior to arriving at the U of L, and was very eager to get involved. It has been an extreamly interesting year and I have learned so much. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="biowrap"><DIV class="bio2"><H3>Harland Brandon</H3><P>This young cowboy has lived for several years on canned beans and buffalo jerky whilst on the pursuit of fortune along the rivers of southern Alberta. Armed with only his quick wit and his two “hand gunz” (see picture to the right/left) has he been able to survive day to day in the rolling coulees he calls home. Some say that his smile has the power to scare packs of coyotes away while still able to lure deer into his striking range. While he has given up the solitary life of a rogue cowboy for life in a research lab he has not given up his true identity as the lone ranger in these parts. His dreams include designing and building a synthetic biology project with space application such that he may one day become a space cowboy. Seriously, he does want to invent and/or help invent a space synthetic biology project! For those of you unfortunate to find yourself in the presence of this cowboy, have no fear for he is quite humorous and friendly if offered a juicy steak and/or refreshing dark beer.  
 </P></DIV><DIV class="bio"><H3>Jenn Huynh</H3><P>Hello world! My name is Jennifer and I have currently only slogged through three full years of my major, Biochemistry. I have just recently been sucked into this whirling vortex of a world known as iGEM due to many persuasive arguments and have not yet lived to regret such a decision (which is a good thing). Hopefully the science and technology, that will further our lives in the very near future, will keep the remainder of the summer and the beginnings of autumn refreshing and fascinating. In the mean time while I am not slaving away in the lab I will occupy my time with catching up on sleep that I have missed during my time as a real student of the University of Lethbridge. It’s a pleasure to introduce myself and hopefully new friendships will emerge in the nearby future. Peace out … for now.
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="biowrap"><DIV class="bio2"><H3>Jenna Friedt</H3><P>Hello! I am a graduate student at the U of L currently completing my Masters degree in Biochemistry and am looking forward to my second year participating in the iGEM competition. Since I’m convinced I was born in the wrong era, I’m currently looking for assistance in inventing a time machine to send me back to the ‘50s, where I would happily fit in with the bubblegum rockers and poodle skirt-wearing youth of the day. Until that happens, I’m content to read a good book, knit, or do crossword puzzles to pass the time outside the lab. Best wishes! 
 </P></DIV><DIV class="bio"><H3>Justin Luu</H3><P>I am an undergraduate student at the University of Lethbridge. I will be going into my second of four years in the B.Sc Biochemistry program. This is my first year competing in the iGEM competition and I am extremely excited. When I am not in the lab I enjoy sleeping, eating and spending time with family/friends. Oh wait! Movies are pretty good too! Thanks for taking the time to read my bio. 
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="biowrap"><DIV class="bio2"><H3>Mackay Murray</H3><P>Hi, my name is Makay Murray (and yes there is to letter ‘c’ in my name, but everyone thinks there should be) I’m currently collecting pre-requisites for Radiology witch I plan to take in 2013. I was invited onto iGEM by Isaac and felt that actually working with bacteria in a lab would be very enlightening to know the deeper workings of cellular activity and how to manipulate these natural processes to create something new. While at school I am also the host of a CKXU 88.3fm radio show entitled University Power Users where I talk about stuff that I think students should know but will never be taught in any classroom. When I’m not at school I’m either working at Able Dental Group as a IT tech or enjoying the wonders of technology by playing various videogames like minecraft, DayZ and Halo. 
</P></DIV><DIV class="bio"><H3>Iian Barkley</H3><P>I am a third year neuroscience major with an interest in utilizing synthetic biology for medical application. Outside of my scientific interests I enjoy rock climbing, diving, playing RPGs, long walks on the beach, gazing at the stars….wait a minute…. this isn’t eHarmony. Anyway I was born in B.C, but I have lived in Ontario, Nova Scotia, California, Connecticut and The Marshall Islands throughout my life. In addition to living the peripatetic life of an academic bohemian (I am also known for having the pretension rivaling that of a Cambridge trained actor), I am also pursuing the conventional aspiration of developing the first virulent strain of bacteria that will help usher in the new zombie apocalypse (Seriously, this is like the space race among science undergrads). 
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="biowrap"><DIV class="bio2"><H3>Zak Stinson</H3><P>Hey, I'm Zak. The only real reason I get up in the morning is the ever-looming eventuality that humanity will integrate with technology, creating a vast, swarm-like intelligence bent on the consumption of whole stellar systems. To help advance us towards our inevitable conquest, I am studying neuroscience and have decided to take part in the iGEM competition this year! This firm belief also explains my obsession with all consumer technology. I occupy the time between now and our eventual fate with bike rides, camping, and dance parties. Oh yeah, and resistance is futile. 
 </P></DIV><DIV class="bio"><H3>Sutherland Dube</H3><P>Hi I’m Sutherland (yes, that is my first name) and I am currently a 4th year student at the U of L majoring in Neuroscience. This is my first year on the iGEM team and so far it has been great! Being a neuroscience major, iGEM has been awesome at providing the opportunity to participate in research outside of my field of study. When I’m not in the lab (either neuroscience or iGEM), I love playing soccer and reading. 
</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="biowrap"><DIV class="bio2"><H3>Nathan Dawson</H3><P>Hello! I’m Nathan a student at the University of Lethbridge, currently entering my second year of Neuroscience. One thing I’ve long known about myself is that I love the sciences, so when I found an opportunity to volunteer in a biochemistry lab this spring I took it without hesitation. Through the volunteer experience I gained a wealth of knowledge (something I’m always hungry for), and a desire to continue exploring the opportunities at the university, for more learning experiences. Being on the University of Lethbridge’s iGEM team has been a gateway to the exciting world of synthetic biology. When I’m not in one of the labs (Ute Kothe’s, or iGEM), I enjoy reading, biking, scuba diving, snowboarding, and volunteering with St. John Ambulance. 
 </P></DIV><DIV class="bio"><H3>Katherine Gyzl</H3><P>Hi I’m Katherine, and I am in my fourth year of biochemistry at the U of L. In my free time, when I have any, I enjoy snowboarding and the outdoors. I got involved with iGEM last year, because synthetic biology fascinated me. I find anything to do with science interesting, and iGEM was a great way to get into research. This year I have stayed on the team because we have a very interesting project and a team composed of some awesome people.

This is my first year in iGEM and it has been a fascinating experience thus far. The U of L iGEM team is a great group to work with and I'm happy to be a part of it. Outside of school my favorite activities are snowboarding, golfing or hanging out with friends. 
 </P></DIV><DIV class="bio"><H3>Ryan Pederson</H3><P>My name is pronounced identically to Peterson; the first syllable is not pronounced the same as in peddle, or pedestrian. Get it wrong and you will force me to get you a cask of Amontillado or possibly an orangutan. I have always been correctly known as a science guy among my friends, just as Prospero was known to throw killer parties, and so when iGEM came tapping at my door I graciously jumped on that beating floor board. Since then, everything seems to be going well, my house has not collapsed and all of my four cats still have both their eyes. I am a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, and, as such, I have placed nine references to different works of Poe in this paragraph. This is my first year in iGEM and I am going into my fourth year of neuroscience.

I have just finished up my first year and will be entering my second year at the University of Lethbridge majoring in Biochemistry. This is my first year with iGEM, and I am looking forward to the knowledge to be gained from the members of the team. I plan on pursuing the career of a Veterinarian after finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Lethbridge. Badminton is one of my favourite activities to do. I enjoy listening to contemporary R&amp;B music as well Hip-Hop such as Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, Claude Kelly, Frankie J and Lupe Fiasco.

Majoring in Biology; the University of Lethbridge I am attending. This will be my fourth year—oh my, so near the ending. Also, this is my second year iGEMing. A single beer is all it takes for a crimson glow to grace my face. A common problem, they do say, for the people of my race. For me, it is a bother, though not one for my younger brother. Is it ironic that “Red” is my favourite colour? Some may say I have a unique sense of fashion. Though shy I once was, not one for social interaction. But now, others shout “Eccentric” whilst smirking at my actions. A lion’s head, I may embellish in a dance of which I do so relish—a musical exhibition originating from the Chinese tradition (Chinese Lion Dance).

I’ve been involved in scientific research since high school and still love every minute of studying proteins in translation or exploring what synthetic biology has to offer.

 </P></DIV><DIV class="bio"><H3>H.J. Wieden</H3><P>Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.
