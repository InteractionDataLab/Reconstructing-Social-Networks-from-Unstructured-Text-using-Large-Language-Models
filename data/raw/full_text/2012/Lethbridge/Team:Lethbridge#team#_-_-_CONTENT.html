There I never would have thought this would be the path I would eventually end up on, but one thing lead to another and here I am. I am taking my Bachelors of Science in Neuroscience, and find it a very exciting field, with a great cross application to Synthetic biology. I enjoy camping and hiking in the mountains, I love skiing both downhill and cross country, and have coached youth cross country ski in past years. I had heard about iGEM prior to arriving at the U of L, and was very eager to get involved. It has been an extreamly interesting year and I have learned so much. </P></DIV><DIV class="bio2"><H3>Ben Vuong</H3><P>I was born and raised in Lethbridge for the whole span of my life. I have just finished up my first year and will be entering my second year at the University of Lethbridge majoring in Biochemistry. This is my first year with iGEM, and I am looking forward to the knowledge to be gained from the members of the team. I plan on pursuing the career of a Veterinarian after finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Lethbridge. Badminton is one of my favourite activities to do. I enjoy listening to contemporary R&amp;B music as well Hip-Hop such as Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, Claude Kelly, Frankie J and Lupe Fiasco.  </P></DIV><DIV class="bio"><H3>Anthony Vuong</H3><P>Anthony Vuong, that is my full name. I am brother to the one with the same surname (Ben). Majoring in Biology; the University of Lethbridge I am attending. This will be my fourth year—oh my, so near the ending. Also, this is my second year iGEMing. A single beer is all it takes for a crimson glow to grace my face. A common problem, they do say, for the people of my race. For me, it is a bother, though not one for my younger brother. Is it ironic that “Red” is my favourite colour? Some may say I have a unique sense of fashion. Though shy I once was, not one for social interaction. But now, others shout “Eccentric” whilst smirking at my actions. A lion’s head, I may embellish in a dance of which I do so relish—a musical exhibition originating from the Chinese tradition (Chinese Lion Dance).  </P></DIV><DIV class="bio2"><H3>Justin Vigar</H3><P>I'm Justin. I think biology is way more fun when looking at it though the eyes of an engineer, so synthetic biology is a perfect fit for me. I am very excited to be working full-time for the Lethbridge iGEM team for the second year in a row. When not in the lab I downhill and freeride mountain bike, ride motocross, play guitar, and enjoy walks on the beach in San Francisco. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
