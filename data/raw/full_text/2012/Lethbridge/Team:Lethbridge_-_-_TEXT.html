Project Overview
Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) has been utilized across the world to increase the productivity of difficult resources including carbonate oil deposits. Using a synthetic biology approach, we have designed the CAB (CO2, acetic acid, and biosurfactant) extraction method that demonstrates a modified MEOR method for extracting carbonate oil deposits.

Boris Lam
Lambo is back once again!  This will be the second time in all of iGEM history! Returning from the great iGEM experience I had in 2011.  This will be my fourth year of university where I am currently majoring in neuroscience.

Dipankar Goyal
Fellow iGemers, we all know Synthetic Biology has moving applications, solutions to problems that may go unresolved otherwise. I have been extremely fortunate to have been a part of the U of L iGEM for two years now and I can say the experience has been absolutely magnificent.

Harland "the Cowboy" Brandon
This young cowboy has lived for several years on canned beans and buffalo jerky whilst on the pursuit of fortune along the rivers of southern Alberta. Armed with only his quick wit and his two “hand gunz” (see picture) has he been able to survive day to day in the rolling coulees he calls home.

H.J. Wieden
Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics.

Isaac Ward
Hello, I am a 3rd year Neuroscience major, and looking to gain all the experience I can in my undergrad career.  So I am back for a second year of iGEM.  I think iGEM provides great opportunities to diversify my skill set and while opening the doors to new possibilities.

Jenn Huynh
Hello world! My name is Jennifer and I have currently only slogged through three full years of my major, Biochemistry. I have just recently been sucked into this whirling vortex of a world known as iGEM due to many persuasive arguments and have not yet lived to regret such a decision (which is a good thing).

Makay Murray
Hi, my name is Makay Murray (and yes there is to letter ‘c’ in my name, but everyone thinks there should be) I’m currently collecting pre-requisites for Radiology witch I plan to take in 2013. I was invited onto iGEM by Isaac and felt that actually working with bacteria in a lab would be very enlightening to know the deeper workings of cellular activity and how to manipulate these natural processes to create something new.

Richard Mclean
Howdy y’all! I’m Richard and I’m entering my fourth year of biochemistry at the U of L. I spent a few years out of school before last fall exploring the culinary world so now I spend most of my time trying to catch up on my studies

Nathan Dawson
Hello! I’m Nathan a student at the University of Lethbridge, currently entering my second year of Neuroscience. One thing I’ve long known about myself is that I love the sciences, so when I found an opportunity to volunteer in a biochemistry lab this spring I took it without hesitation.

Ryan Pederson
Entombed by walls of monolithic stone while barred from vistas of bucolic plateaus regularly interspersed with the linear and euclidean masonry of modernity awash in the scintillating light of a gibbous moon occluded by peripatetic clouds, I toil on my work as scion of Darwin and Mendel peering at incalculable numbers of lilliputian...

Zac Stinson
Hey, I'm Zak. The only real reason I get up in the morning is the ever-looming eventuality that humanity will integrate with technology, creating a vast, swarm-like intelligence bent on the consumption of whole stellar systems.
