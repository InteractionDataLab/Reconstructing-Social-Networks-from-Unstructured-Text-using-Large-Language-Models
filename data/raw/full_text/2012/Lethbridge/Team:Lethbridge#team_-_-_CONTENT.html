This will be my first year contending in the iGEM competition. I joined the UofL iGEM team to exploit the many opportunities it has to offer. And so far, the program is very rewarding: it allows me to explore an alternative and fascinating field of biology, and provides me with the privilege of working alongside and learning from veteran iGEMers. But enough of the science-y stuff! When I’m not working in the Kothe RNA lab or the iGEM lab, you can find me on the battlegrounds defending the Sanctuary from the Prime Evils or living vicariously through the Game of Thrones series. But aside from the medieval fantasy, I also enjoy hiking, and playing badminton. </P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Anthony Vuong</STRONG></P><P>Anthony Vuong, that is my full name. I am brother to the one with the
same surname (Ben). Majoring in Biology; the University of Lethbridge
I am attending. This will be my last year—oh my, so near the ending.
Also, this is my third year iGEMing. A single beer is all it takes for
a crimson glow to grace my face. A common problem, they do say, for
the people of my race. For me, it is a bother, though not one for my
younger brother. Is it ironic that “Red” is my favourite colour? Some
may say I have a unique sense of fashion. Though shy I once was, not
one for social interaction. But now, others shout “Eccentric” whilst
smirking at my actions. A lion’s head, I may embellish in a dance of
which I do so relish—a musical exhibition originating from the Chinese
tradition (Chinese Lion Dance).</P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Ben Vuong</STRONG></P><P>I was born and raised in Lethbridge. I have just finished up my second year at the University of Lethbridge currently majoring in Neuroscience. This is my second year participating in the iGEM collegiate division, as well as my first year as an advisor for the 2012 Lethbridge High School Division team. I plan on pursuing a career as a Veterinarian after finishing up my undergraduate degree at the University of Lethbridge. I look forward to working with all the other team members and any other labs we have the opportunity to collaborate with.  In my spare time I find myself enjoying badminton, basketball and exercising. </P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Boris Lam</STRONG></P><P>Lambo is back once again!</P><P>This will be the second time in all of iGEM history! Returning from the great iGEM experience I had in 2011.  This will be my fourth year of university where I am currently majoring in neuroscience.  When I am not sweating over a bunsen burner or mass murdering bacteria in lab, you can find me on the battlefield wearing shiny sneakers and protecting the entire human race from supernatural beings with just a mere xbox controller. On my days off, I enjoy jamming/dancing to music (not in public of course ^_^), playing hockey, golfing and any kind of sport in general. 
I look forward in meeting everyone at the Jamboree this year! </P><P>PAYCE!!!</P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Dustin Smith</STRONG></P><P>Hi! I'm Dustin. I was born and raised in Lethbridge, and this is my final year as an undergraduate majoring in biochemistry. This is my second year in iGEM, and as always it has been a great experience. The U of L iGEM team is a great group to work with and I'm happy to be a part of it. Outside of school my favourite activities are snowboarding, working out, or hanging out with friends.</P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Harland &quot;the Cowboy&quot; Brandon</STRONG></P><P>This young cowboy has lived for several years on canned beans and buffalo jerky whilst on the pursuit of fortune along the rivers of southern Alberta. Armed with only his quick wit and his two “hand gunz” (see picture) has he been able to survive day to day in the rolling coulees he calls home. Some say that his smile has the power to scare packs of coyotes away while still able to lure deer into his striking range. While he has given up the solitary life of a rogue cowboy for life in a research lab he has not given up his true identity as the lone ranger in these parts. His dreams include designing and building a synthetic biology project with space application such that he may one day become a space cowboy. Seriously, he does want to invent and/or help invent a space synthetic biology project!</P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Ryan Pederson</STRONG></P><P>Entombed by walls of monolithic stone while barred from vistas of bucolic
plateaus regularly interspersed with the linear and euclidean masonry of
modernity awash in the scintillating light of a gibbous moon occluded by
peripatetic clouds, I toil on my work as scion of Darwin and Mendel
peering at incalculable numbers of lilliputian bulbous creatures of
peculiar properties imposed upon them by the contriving mind of man in the
midst of a rancour of vacuous ribald jest and interminable pedantic
criticism, precisely the sort pernicious and incessant buzzing that
produces a deleterious effect on those possessing particularly sensitive
sensibilities of the anachronistic variety. Or, in non-Lovecraftian speak, I work in a synthetic biology lab with no
windows and discussions by me and my lab-mates are not always suitable for
all audiences.</P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Sutherland Dube</STRONG></P>
Hey, I’m Sutherland (yes, that is my first name) and I just completed my undergrad in Neuroscience and will be beginning grad school in the fall. This is my second year on the Lethbridge iGEM team, in addition to being an advisor for the 2012 Lethbridge High School team. iGEM has been a great experience over the past couple of years— I’ve learned a ton! When I’m not in the lab (either neuroscience or iGEM), I love playing soccer and reading. </DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Richard McLean</STRONG></P>
Howdy y’all! I’m Richard and I’m entering my fourth year of biochemistry at the U of L. I spent a few years out of school before last fall exploring the culinary world so now I spend most of my time trying to catch up on my studies; The rest of my time I divide between iGem and the local Research Center. I like to think that if I wasn’t as busy, I would fill my free time with activities that would make this bio a more interesting read… At any rate, I’m looking forward to meeting everyone at the workshops and jamboree.  </DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Jenna Friedt - Advisor</STRONG></P><P>Hello! I am a graduate student at the U of L currently completing my Masters degree in Biochemistry and am looking forward to my second year participating in the iGEM competition. Since I’m convinced I was born in the wrong era, I’m currently looking for assistance in inventing a time machine to send me back to the ‘50s, where I would happily fit in with the bubblegum rockers and poodle skirt-wearing youth of the day. Until that happens, I’m content to read a good book, knit, or do crossword puzzles to pass the time outside the lab.

I have been extremely fortunate to have been a part of the U of L iGEM for two years now and I can say the experience has been absolutely magnificent. Synthetic Biology defines one part of me; I also have keen interest in the field of medicine especially programs such as the Doctors without Borders. In my spare time, if any, I am either figuring out ways to park free of cost at the university or paying university parking tickets downtown. </P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Nathan Dawson</STRONG></P><P>Hello! I’m Nathan a student at the University of Lethbridge, currently entering my second year of Neuroscience. One thing I’ve long known about myself is that I love the sciences, so when I found an opportunity to volunteer in a biochemistry lab this spring I took it without hesitation. Through the volunteer experience I gained a wealth of knowledge (something I’m always hungry for), and a desire to continue exploring the opportunities at the university, for more learning experiences. Being on the University of Lethbridge’s iGEM team has been a gateway to the exciting world of synthetic biology. When I’m not in one of the labs (Ute Kothe’s, or iGEM), I enjoy reading, biking, scuba diving, snowboarding, and volunteering with St. John Ambulance.</P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Iain Barkley</STRONG></P><P>A 3rd year neuroscience major with an interests in synthetic biology for biomedical applications, in particular by engineering and modifying genetic circuits to facilitate enhanced communication and information processing between cells. Iain wishes to design more refined methods for neurobiological research by building upon the pre-existing knowledge of synthetic biology principles. He is captivated by iGEM because he believes it acts not only as a nexus for innovative and extraordinary applications that will shape and define the 21st century, but is a community rich in intellectual resources through which undergraduates previously had limited access to. He plans to pursue a career in biomedical research focusing on creating new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.</P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Isaac Ward</STRONG></P>
Hello, I am a 3rd year Neuroscience major, and looking to gain all the
experience I can in my undergrad career.  So I am back for a second year
of iGEM.  I think iGEM provides great opportunities to diversify my skill
set and while opening the doors to new possibilities.    As an example
this year I got the opportunity to be an advisor for the first Lethbridge
High School iGEM team, it was an amazing experience to say the least.
When I am not busy in the labs (like that ever happens), I enjoy being out
having great adventures.</DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Jenn Huynh</STRONG></P><P>Hello world! My name is Jennifer and I have currently only slogged through three full years of my major, Biochemistry. I have just recently been sucked into this whirling vortex of a world known as iGEM due to many persuasive arguments and have not yet lived to regret such a decision (which is a good thing). Hopefully the science and technology, that will further our lives in the very near future, will keep the remainder of the summer and the beginnings of autumn refreshing and fascinating. In the mean time while I am not slaving away in the lab I will occupy my time with catching up on sleep that I have missed during my time as a real student of the University of Lethbridge. It’s a pleasure to introduce myself and hopefully new friendships will emerge in the nearby future. Peace out … for now.</P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Justin Luu</STRONG></P>
I am an undergraduate student at the University of Lethbridge. I will be going into my second of four years in the B.Sc Biochemistry program. This is my first year competing in the iGEM competition and I am extremely excited. When I am not in the lab I enjoy sleeping, eating and spending time with family/friends. Oh wait! Movies are pretty good too! Thanks for taking the time to read my bio.</DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Katherine Gzyl</STRONG>
Hi I’m Katherine, and I am in my fourth year of biochemistry at the U of L. In my free time, when I have any, I enjoy snowboarding and the outdoors. I got involved with iGEM last year, because synthetic biology fascinated me. I find anything to do with science interesting, and iGEM was a great way to get into research. This year I have stayed on the team because we have a very interesting project and a team composed of some awesome people.</P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Makay Murray</STRONG></P>
Hi, my name is Makay Murray (and yes there is to letter ‘c’ in my name, but everyone thinks there should be) I’m currently collecting pre-requisites for Radiology which I plan to take in 2013. I was invited onto iGEM by Isaac and felt that actually working with bacteria in a lab would be very enlightening to know the deeper workings of cellular activity and how to manipulate these natural processes to create something new. While at school I am also the host of a CKXU 88.3fm radio show entitled University Power Users where I talk about stuff that I think students should know but will never be taught in any classroom. When I’m not at school I’m either working at Able Dental Group as a IT tech or enjoying the wonders of technology by playing various videogames like minecraft, DayZ and Halo.</DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Zak Stinson</STRONG></P><P>Hey, I'm Zak. The only real reason I get up in the morning is the ever-looming eventuality that humanity will integrate with technology, creating a vast, swarm-like intelligence bent on the consumption of whole stellar systems. To help advance us towards our inevitable conquest, I am studying neuroscience and have decided to take part in the iGEM competition this year! This firm belief also explains my obsession with all consumer technology. I occupy the time between now and our eventual fate with bike rides, camping, and dance parties. Oh yeah, and resistance is futile. </P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Mackenzie Coatham - Advisor</STRONG></P><P>Hi iGEMers! My name is Mackenzie and I’m a fourth year biochemistry major who is competing in iGEM for a THIRD time! I’ve been involved in scientific research since high school and still love every minute of studying proteins in translation or exploring what synthetic biology has to offer. When I’m not in a lab coat holding a pipette, I can often be found dancing or watching my fair share of So You Think You Can Dance!
 </P></DIV><DIV style="min-height: 375px;" class="content-wrap-team"><P><STRONG>Hans-Joachim Wieden - Supervisor</STRONG></P><P>Originally from Germany I moved to Canada in 2005 to start a research group on the structure and function of the bacterial protein synthesis machinery, a cellular process targeted by over 50% of the known antibiotics. I am intrigued by the molecular design and function of this essential bio-nanomachine. I try to unravel the underlying design principles in order to enable the rational design and engineering of novel bio-nanomachines. I am essentially asking the question if such novel bio-machines can be constructed from simple and fundamental principles or are these assemblies just to complex. Well and that’s why it was extremely easy to rope me into doing iGEM.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
