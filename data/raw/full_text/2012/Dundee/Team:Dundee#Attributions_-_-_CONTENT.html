                The Dundee iGem team would like to extend our deepest thanks to each and every individual, 
                company and sponsor who have helped us along our way. Without your kind assistance and support, 
                our project would only have remained an idea.

Thanks to the Division of Molecular Microbiology in the College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, for giving us laboratory and office space, and the use of equipment, to carry out this project. We gratefully acknowledge The Wellcome Trust Rotation Studentship Program at Dundee for providing key molecular biology equipment. We thank all our sponsors for the consumables and some other equipment used in this work (listed below). Student stipends over the summer were awarded by The Wellcome Trust (seven studentships). Travel funds were provided by the Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance (SULSA), the University of Dundee, the James Hutton Institute  and the Nine Trades of Dundee.

T-shirt design was the work of Frank Sargent.

Other individuals worthy of special mention are:
<B>Dr James Cargill:</B> For sharing his knowledge of <I>Clostridium difficile</I>.<B>Miss Katie Ravenscraig Morrison:</B> Who created the graphic version of our team mascot.<B>Mr Jaeger Hamilton:</B> For taking part in the video for our song.<B>Mr Andrew Herd:</B> For helping with the design of the wiki.<B>Mrs Geraldine Sandilands:</B> For keeping us right with all of the travel arrangements for Edinburgh, London and Amsterdam.<B>Dr Jackie Heilbronn:</B> For general assistance with ordering and lab safety.<B>Dr Lisa Grayson:</B> Who assisted us when answering the safety questions and helped us to formulate our risk assessments.<B>Dr Nicola Stanley-Wall:</B> For advice, and for providing us with materials that we were able to use on our outreach day at The Shore.<B>Mr Nicholas Dawes:</B> For advice and help with wiki, Matlab and Comsol.<B>Dr Sarah Coulthurst and her group:</B> For advice and and discussions on bacterial Type VI Secretion Systems.<B>Professor Eric Cascades:</B> For allowing us to reproduce his diagram of the Type VI Secretion System.<B>Professor Angus Lamond:</B> For his artistic input. <B>Professor Neil Fairweather:</B> For providing us with a synthetic gene for the phage endolysin.<B>Mr Ross Middlemiss:</B> For setting up the iGEM recording suite and mastering our song.

None of the advisors or instructors are involved in <I>C. difficile</I> research nor study the Type VI Secretion Systems of <I>Salmonella</I> nor are experts in modelling bacterial population dynamics or gut bulk flow - the project areas were chosen entirely by the team. All cloning and sequencing was carried out by Rachael, Avril and Nicola. Western blotting and radiolabelling work was done by Kimberly. Tracy Palmer, Grant Buchanan, Frank Sargent and Ciaran Kelly were the supervisors of this part of the project. Website design was started by Chris and finished off by Avril and Andrew H. The Android apps, games and other software were written by Chris. Mathematical modelling was figured out by Johnny, Jill and Chris under the supervision of Dyce, Lionel and Andrew S. All juggling was performed by Avril and Duncan.
