Scottish iGEM Team Meet-up: 27th June, Edinburgh University, Edinburgh
Dundee iGEM Team joined the other Scottish teams from Edinburgh and St Andrews universities at a collaboration day hosted by The University of Edinburgh. We discussed strategies, shared ideas and discussed potential problems. We also participated in workshops together before giving a small presentation on our plans for devlopment of our project. The feedback was really helpful.
