As a new approach to sharing our science with the general public at large, we took our science to the streets of Scotland's capital and dramatised our project as buskers in the WORLD FAMOUS Edinburgh International Festival Fringe! Our story follows a juggler who, having problems with his natural balance, enlists the help of a young scientist who uses a variety of different props to help him restore it. Our aim was create a fun show which illustrated some key points on synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, and also informed the public of what our project hoped to achieve. We hope you enjoy watching it as much as we enjoyed performing it!
