                Lysis To Kill is a game developed for the Android platform. The concept of the game was 
                inspired by Splashback which was a Flash game developed for the Cartoon Network 
                <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Dundee/References">[1]</A>. 
                The original concept involved adding drops of 'goo' to a playing board in order to burst 'blobs', 
                creating a cascade of bursts. The aim was to clear the playing board in as few clicks as possible. 
                In a similar fashion, Lysis To Kill draws on the same game concept with a twist to mirror the 
                iGEM project we have undertaken. 
                
                You start the game with 10 clicks. You are in charge of the friendly, synthetically engineered 
                E-coli cells (in green), and each time you click a cell it shrinks and eventually bursts. 
                Your goal is to destroy all the C.diff cells with φCD27 endolysin, which is fired from your 
                E.coli cells  whenever they burst. Each level grants you an extra click, and points are awarded 
                for every C.diff cell destroyed. Bonus points are awarded if you finish a level with a clear board. 
                The game is free to 
                <A href="#dl">download</A>, and the full source code is provided.

                The Dundee iGEM team of 2011 created an Android application named the Lazy Scientist, and this 
                year we chose to follow up the application with a suite of useful tools for biology students. 
                The main goal was to provide some useful applications and to provide access to the source code 
                to enable developers to add, modify and change the application to suit their needs. The app is 
                free to <A href="#dl">download</A>, and the full source code is provided.
                
                The application currently contains the following tools:
                <UL style="padding-left: 4%;"><LI>Ratio to Percentage/ Percentage to Ratio Convertor</LI><LI>OD660 to Cell Count Estimator</LI><LI>Simple Dilution Calculator</LI><LI>Serial Dilution Checker</LI></UL><DIV class="caption" style="width: 80%;">
                    (** Note: The OD660 calculator is based on a single sample set of data that, for obvious reasons, 
                    can only provide an estimate of cell count.
                    For more accurate OD calculations, in-situ, calibrated laboratory equipment should be used.)

                Splicer is a short game of six test levels developed for the Windows desktop. The premise is 
                simple - from a selection of Biobricks, you are tasked with the creation of biological solutions 
                to given problems. By selecting each Biobrick, you insert it into the plasmid in the centre. Once 
                you think you have a viable solution, you click on the 'Transcribe &amp; Translate' button to see if 
                you were right. If you are comfortable with C#, the full source code is included so that you may 
                add more Biobricks and more levels.
                
                The game was developed in Visual Studio using the XNA libraries, and full source code is provided 
                in the <A href="#dl">download</A> section, along with a full installable version of the game, which 
                can be removed via the Windows control panel as normal.

                From the onset of the project, the modelling team had to carry out investigative research to 
                understand the biological processes that were involved in the project to ascertain appropriate 
                modelling methodologies to adopt. Due to the unique combination of factors involved in the project, 
                it became evident that there were considerable quantities of mathematical variables that defined the 
                behaviour of the cellular interaction. From a software development perspective, it was attractive 
                to take the mathematical axioms of behaviour, and to wrap them within a bespoke modelling solution 
                to provide a visual representation of the project.
                
                CellSim is a cross-platform, 2D, cellular automata 
                <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Dundee/References" target="_blank">[4]</A> (CA) modelling 
                tool that was developed 
                to demonstrate, in a graphical manner, how the synthetically modified E-coli and C.diff cells 
                could interact in a simulated environment. The application was designed to simulate the cellular 
                interactions whilst also providing a customisable simulation environment that could enable the tool 
                to be used in other, similar projects. CellSim was developed to enable it to be executed on either 
                Linux or Windows based systems, and is released under the GNU GPL 3 license that permits copying, 
                modification and redistribution of the program. The source code and full class diagram is provided 
                within the download archives for educational purposes as well as encouraging others to build upon 
                the initial release.
                
                CellSim initialises the environment by parsing the text data file 'settings.dat' which must 
                be located within the same folder as the program. The download archive contains an example of the 
                settings file which provides all the parameters that are available for user modification. 
                The current development version (1.0) provides an environment in which the following aspects 
                can be simulated and defined by the user:
                <UL style="padding-left: 4%;"><LI>Cellular Mitosis Rates</LI><LI>Strains</LI><LI>Colony Size, Initial Positioning &amp; Colouration</LI><LI>Medium Flow Effects</LI><LI>Mucus Wall Effects</LI><LI>Time Calibrated Rendering</LI><LI>Nutrient Availability, Supply &amp; Absorption</LI><LI>Low Nutrient Mitosis Suppression</LI></UL>
                The program was developed around an MVC structural design pattern 
                <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Dundee/References" target="_blank">[3]</A>       with a subtle modification. 
                The initial design adopted a classic MVC 
                <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Dundee/References" target="_blank">[3]</A> 
                architecture, whereby for each generation, each cell 
                was updated within the model classes, and subsequently rendered within the view classes. Due to 
                the large number of cells that the program is required to simulate, code profiling highlighted 
                the inefficiency if iterating through all cells twice. Furthermore, the status of each cell is 
                partly determined by neighbouring cells, and therefore a method was required to detect the presence 
                of neighbouring cells and their status. To accomplish this through data provided solely within the 
                model, for each cell, all other cells would require iteration and interrogation leading to a time 
                complexity of at least O(n<SUP>2</SUP>). Due to the mitosis behaviour of cells, the source number of cells 
                also increases in a quadratic manner. The quadratic mitosis behaviour cannot be alleviated, as it 
                represents the real-world scenario, so a solution was sought to alleviate the compound quadratic 
                time complexity that arose from the classic MVC 
                <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Dundee/References" target="_blank">[3]</A> 
                implementation.
                
                The solution adopted was to carry out cell interrogation, cell update and rendering in a single 
                pass, and establishing the presence of neighbouring cells by direct interrogation of the graphics 
                memory as opposed to model data interrogation. By calculating the base address of the graphics 
                memory in conjunction with the co-ordinates of the current cell, a direct memory address could be 
                calculated and accessed to establish the presence of neighbouring cells, alleviating the need to 
                iterate through all cells. By adopting these measures, the time complexity of the 'cell evolution' 
                section of code was reduced to a constant, greatly improving the speed and number of cells that 
                the program could comfortably emulate.
                
                Cellular movement emulates fluid flow by imposing a circular pressure front that is circular in 
                nature. This provides a simple model that affects each cell's horizontal position by exerting 
                a greater force on those nearest to the centre of fluid flow. To enable variable flow rates to be 
                simulated, a normalised force was calculated from the cell's co-ordinates (x, y) relative to the 
                display screens height (Ymax), multiplied by a user adjustable force factor (f) and utilised to 
                modify the horizontal position of the cell. By carrying out this calculation on each cell, a 
                realistic, circular flow pressure is simulated. The new horizontal cell position is calculated 
                from the following formula:
                
                To provide a realistic and accurate movement of cells within CA environment, each cell contains 
                co-ordinate members for the respective 'x' and 'y' position. These class members are defined as 
                float data types as opposed to integers to permit gradual movements to be achieved. To render each 
                cell, the co-ordinates are simply cast to integer types before being passed to the graphics 
                interface. This permits cell movements to be calculable to fractions of a pixel, and provides an 
                accurate representation of the behaviour required.
                
                The application adopts the SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer) graphics API that was chosen primarily 
                due to its flexibility, and is licensed under GNU LGPL version 2 
                <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Dundee/References" target="_blank">[2]. </A>
                Furthermore, the library 
                provides binary compilations for a wide variety of operating systems including Windows, Linux 
                and MacOS. To encourage development of the program, pre-developed Eclipse and Visual Studio 11 
                project files have been created, and are free to download and explore. Alternatively, the packages 
                also include the pre-compiled binary versions of the application within the 'Release' folder of 
                the download archive (ZIP) files.
