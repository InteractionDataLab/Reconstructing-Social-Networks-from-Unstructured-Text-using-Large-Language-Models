We took the Biology out of the lab and into the community once more by holding a mini event at The Shore, a youth drop-in centre run by Dundee City Council. Our aim was to give the youngsters some information about Synthetic Biology and the iGEM competition and to give them an idea about how much bacteria and fungi are used in the things they use every day. To directly involve them in the science, we had them do fingerprints on LB plates, which were grown back in the lab and we returned the following weekend with the photo evidence of what they had had on their hands! We also took along a suggestions box so they could come up with ideas of what they would try and make using synthetic biology.
