The problem addressed in this project is characterised by processes occurring  over a vast range of spatial and temporal scales: from the protein structure of the T6SS to  large-scale effects in the colon.  This range of scales presents a chain of biological questions: can we engineer an E.coli that produces enough endolysin to kill C. difficile? What are the factors that could lead to success and failure of an E. coli therapy? What if processes are stochastic? Could our engineered E. coli be an efficient solution in realistic conditions? The mathematical modelling component of this project attempts to address these questions by both underpinning the lab work and extending it beyond what is capable on the bench. Clicking on the tabs to the right and linking to the Software Page ,  will reveal the  variety of modelling techniques used  -  from ODE and PDE models to our bespoke CellSim cellular automata. Our results obtained so far are summarised there. The work continues…
