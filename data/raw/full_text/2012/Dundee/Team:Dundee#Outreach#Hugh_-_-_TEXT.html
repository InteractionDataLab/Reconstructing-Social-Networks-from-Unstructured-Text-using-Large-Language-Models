As well as simply speaking to the public, we wanted to give them something entertaining and informative that they could take away for themselves, and so the idea of a comic was born. Hugh has been met with a fantastic response, and has gone off on adventures all around the UK, being given to our audience at the Edinburgh Festival, sent to schools, libraries and museums, including the popular Wellcome Collection in London!
