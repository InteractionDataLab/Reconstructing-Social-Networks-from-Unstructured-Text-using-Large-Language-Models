engineer a faster fluorescence biosensor</SPAN></H3><P>Our goal is to engineer a novel biosensor with a faster readout than is currently available. Many bacteria produce, secrete, and respond to chemicals called autoinducers to monitor population density and to synchronize gene expression, a process called quorum sensing. In quorum sensing based biosensors, detection of autoinducer activates transcription of a reporter gene, which must then be translated and accumulate to detectable levels, which can take two to four hours. In our system, we will use TraR, a protein used in the quorum sensing response of <I>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</I>, which dimerizes only in the presence of its autoinducer. We have successfully fused traR to sequence for two separate complementary fragments of GFP. Upon addition of autoinducer, we predict that already accumulated TraR-GFP fragment monomers will dimerize, allowing the GFP fragments to interact and fluoresce. This new approach may drastically reduce the time necessary for future biosensors to produce detectable output.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Project_Overview">Project Overview</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Motivation">Motivation</SPAN></H3><P>Biosensors have a wide range of applications, but for many of those applications there already exists a machine that can do a better job than our engineered bacteria. One of the biggest liabilities in using a biological system is the time associated with getting the desired information. Cells have to metabolize the desired chemical, alter gene expression, and accumulate enough protein in order to produce a measurable output.
</P><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">A biosensor used in our mentor lab responding to different concentrations of autoinducer</DIV></DIV></DIV><P>In the graph to the left, it takes on the order of 2-3 hours before a LuxR based GFP reporter reaches maximum signal. We designed our system based on the prediction that waiting for dimerization is a lot faster than waiting for transcription, translation, and protein accumulation.
</P><P>An added benefit to designing our system with TraR to fluoresce independent of TraR's ability to regulate genes is that TraR does not activate transcription in <I>E. coli</I>. <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19732344" class="external text" rel="nofollow">In a paper</A> published in 2009 by Qin et. al. they show that TraR is unable to recruit <I> E. coli</I>'s native RNA polymerase. It has been shown in <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC126196/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">another paper</A>, however, that TraR does fold properly into monomers and will dimerize in the presence of its autoinducer in <I>E. coli</I>. So this system, as we've designed it, will be the first to use TraR in a fluorescence based biosensor in <I>E. coli</I> since it does not require TraR to active transcription but only to fold correctly and dimerize.

By choosing this method, we were able to use the provided controls in testing our part. <A href="http://www.yale.edu/reganlab/pdfs/WilsonRegan2004NatMethods.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Here</A> is a paper detailing the plasmids.
</P><P>The pET11a plasmid is under control of T7 polymerase, so we used Bl21(DE3) <I>E. coli</I> cells which have an IPTG-inducible copy of the polymerase on their chromosome.
</P><P>The designed fusion into pET11a was compatible with the TraR sequence, but the pMRBAD fusion was not. The pMRBAD fusion was designed to use NcoI and AatII, but TraR had two AatII sites in the coding sequence. We instead cloned TraR in-between the NcoI and Sph1 sites. This added two amino acids to the linker, one of which was a cysteine. It is unclear whether these additional amino acids will disrupt the ability for TraR and the CGFP fragment to fold independently from one another.

</P><P>Transformed BL21(DE3) cells carrying both the pET11a-TraR-NGFP and pMRBAD-TraR-CGFP were plated on media containing IPTG, arabinose, and varying amounts of autoinducer, either synthesized, or from sterile supernatants. As of this writing, no conditions produce visible GFP on plates.
</P><P>Flow cytometry was performed on colonies from the leucine zipper controls, colonies from plates without induction, and colonies grown on plates contiaint 25% supernatants from a strain constitutive for TraI, the enzyme responsible for making TraR's recognized autoinducer.
</P><P>The leucine zipper colonies were centered around 10<SUP>4</SUP>, the colonies without induction around 10<SUP>1</SUP>. The colonies grown on TraI suppernatant supplemented media looked very similar to those without induction, with only a small peak in the range that GFP should produce.
</P><P>Though this result is not completely positive, some GFP was observed in the TraR fusion colonies. This could mean that with careful optimization of conditions, this system could function as designed.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</SPAN></H3><P>We characterized part BBa_K091134 from the registry which is designed to express GFP in the presence of the autoinducer N-oxo3 dodecanoyl homoserine lactone (<I>Pseudomonas autoinducer</I>, PAI).  The part is contained in the plasmid psB1AK3 which has markers for ampicillin and kanamycin resistance. It contains the LasR receptor (C0079) from <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> and a GFP reporter (E0040). In this part, GFP expression is under the control of the LasR+PAI promoter (R0079). The part should produce LasR which receives the PAI. Binding of LasR to the PAI should be reported by GFP expression. <I>lasR</I> is reported to be under the control of the PLlac 0-1 promoter (R0011) in the part. The PLlac 0-1 promoter is a hybrid consisting of the lambda phage promoter P(L) with the cI binding sites replaced with lacO1. In nature, LasR bound to the PAI is the activator for the expression of the <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> elastase gene (<I>lasB</I>).

Transformed cells were plated on LB agar plates containing either ampicillin, kanamycin, or ampicillin and kanamycin. Colonies were observed on the kan plates and the amp plates but never on the amp and kan plates. Characterization was continued using a colony from the LB/kan plate.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Response_to_Autoinducer">Response to Autoinducer</SPAN></H4><P>In the presence of N-oxo3 dodecanoyl homoserine lactone  at various concentrations alone (100 μM, 10 μM, 1μM, 0.1 μM, 0.01 μM, 1 nm, 0.1 nm) and N-oxo3 dodecanoyl homoserine lactone  (same concentrations) + IPTG, DH5α/psB1AK3[BBa_K091134] did not produce a detectable fluorescent signal. However,the data are less than clear as our positive control showed no fluorescence either.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Sequencing">Sequencing</SPAN></H4><P>The psB1AK3/BBa_K091134 plasmid was extracted from the transformed cells for sequencing. Standard primers for sequencing/amplifying BioBrick parts were used: VF2 (tgccacctgacgtctaagaa) and VR (attaccgcctttgagtgagc). The sequencing was successful for both primers. EMBOSS Needle was used to align sequencing results to the expected sequence for the part (see attached sequencing data).
</P><P>The sequence from VF2 from bp 331 to 1099 aligned with the expected sequence from bp 1 to 752 with 92.2% identity. However, it was noted that the region from 332 to 404 bp on the VF2 sequence aligned imperfectly with the expected sequence for that region (1 to 75 bp in the expected sequence for the part).  This region is supposed to include the sequence for the PLlac 0-1 promoter (R0011)
</P><P>However, a comparison between the expected sequence (aattgtgagcggataacaattgacattgtgagcggataacaagatactgagcaca) against the VF2 sequence (agttctggcaggtttggccgcgggttctttttggtacacgaaagc) reveals very little identity (43.1%). This leads us to believe that the promoter region (R0011) for LasR expression is missing and that the part will not function as expected. A BLAST search the VF2 sequence suggests the part does contain the LasR coding sequence (C0079). Directly upstream of the LasR coding sequence is the ribosomal binding site (B0034) which appears to be the correct sequence. However, upstream of the ribosomal binding site, the VF2 sequence BLASTs to the <I>P. aeruginosa</I><I>lasB</I> gene starting at 247 bp. Upstream of <I>lasB</I> appears to be vector sequence. Nowhere in the sequence is the PLlac 0-1 promoter region (R0011). 
</P><P>The VR sequence (reverse complement) from 1 to 939bp aligns with the expected sequence from 1059 to 2047bp with 97.7% identity. There appears to be no significantly misaligned region. The VR sequence appears to contain the correct sequences for the LasR+PAI promoter (R0079), the ribosomal binding site (B0032), GFP (E0040), and the transcriptional terminator (B0010 and B0012).

</PRE><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Conclusions">Conclusions</SPAN></H3><P>From the sequencing data alone, it appears that beyond the expected PLlac 0-1 promoter region, the part is otherwise constructed as reported. However, the lack of the PLlac 0-1 promoter region means that <I>lasR</I> will not be expressed and there we anticipate that there will be no response (i.e. fluorescence) to the presence of the autoinducer.  To fix this part, the <I>lasB</I> and vector coding sequences upstream of <I>lasR</I> would need to be cut out and replaced with PLlac 0-1. This is predicted to restore the desired function to the part.
