Undergraduate Students
Joseph Elsherbini
Joseph is a fourth year undergraduate majoring in Biology. His hobbies include pipetting, aquaponic daydreaming, and arguing on the internet. He suffers from obsessive compulsive wiki editting disorder. He is a proponent of kale, a congener connoisseur, and an e-sport aficionado. He hopes to wrap up his studies at Georgia Tech as quickly as possible in order to pursue pipetting at the graduate level.
Jenny Boothby
Jenny is a third year majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Biology. She is currently Co-President of the Women’s Club Volleyball team and participates in volleyball tournaments in the Atlanta area outside of the club. She also enjoys cooking, traveling, and doing jigsaw puzzles. She wants a microscope for Christmas.
Natalie Chilcutt
Jennifer Goff
Jennifer is a third year undergraduate Biology major. Outside of her love for all things microbe-related, she also has a strong passion for undergraduate science education. She also enjoys tumblr-ing, going off on tangential rants about things she loves, sleeping, and finding awesome places to eat. After graduation, she hopes to go to grad school to pursue a degree in microbiology.
Mitesh Agrawal
Mitesh is a fourth year undergraduate majoring in Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Management studies. His hobbies include playing tennis, getting lost in the fantasy novels and playing FIFA. He is a huge Manchester United fan and in an ideal world, would like to be the soccer club's physio. For now, he is content with doing research and daydreaming.
Advisors
Dr. Brian Hammer
Brian Hammer is an assistant professor in Biology at Georgia Tech. Dr. Hammer received a B.S. in Biology from Boston College, and his PhD in Microbiology at the University of Michigan Medical School, and was a postdoc at Princeton University. His research interests include bacterial genetics and quorum sensing.  Dr. Hammer is known for playing vintage rock songs in his genetics class, enjoys indoor rock climbing with his family and running at 5:30 AM.
Dr. Patrick Bardill
Patrick Bardill is a post-doctoral researcher in Brian Hammer’s lab. His primary research interests are the mechanisms that microorganisms use to sense and respond to their environment. His current research goals involve understanding genes regulated by the Vibrio cholerae quorum sensing system as well as the mechanism of integrating the inputs into the system. Finally, he also studies synthetic quorum sensing communication systems to test the limits of bacterial communication.
Youssef Chahibi
Youssef Chahibi is a first-year PhD Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech in the Broadband Wireless Networking laboratory. He received the Diplôme d'Ingénieur in Telecommunications and Networks from ENSEEIHT (Toulouse, France), and the Master of Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta, USA) on May 2012. He is interested in biologically-inspired nano-scale molecular communication. He enjoys studying languages, traveling, and soccer.
Dr. Mark Styczynski
Mark Styczynski is an assistant professor in Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Tech. Dr. Hammer received a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame, received his PhD in Chemical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and was a postdoc at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA. His research interests include metabolic dynamics and regulation in a variety of systems, as well as metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.  Dr. Styczynski enjoys almost all things outdoors, though is probably most fond of taking in nature from a quiet mountaintop.
Samit Watve
Samit is a second year PhD student in the Hammer Lab. A former iGemmer, he now enjoys being a team advisor. Loves cooking, Sunday afternoons and hiking. He has a recently found interest in all things technological.
