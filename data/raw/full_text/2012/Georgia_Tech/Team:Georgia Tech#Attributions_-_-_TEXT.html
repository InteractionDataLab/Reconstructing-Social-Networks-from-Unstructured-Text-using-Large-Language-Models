Attributions
All wet-lab work, including cloning, characterization, and crying, was carried out by undergraduate members of the team. Undergrad iGEMers were also responsible for the modeling, planning the outreach, and making of the wiki.
Dr. Clay Fuqua
We want to especially thank Dr. Clay Fuqua of University of Illinois for providing us (finally) with working template DNA for PCRing TraR. He also provided us with a strain that churns out an immense amount of TraR specific autoinducer, and gave us a ton of information and help to make sure we were on the right track. Thank you Dr. Fuqua!
Dr. Lynne Regan
We also want to thank Dr. Lynne Regan from Yale university, who provided us with the pET11a-link-NGFP and pMRBAD-link-CGFP plasmids, which we used for all of our flouresence assays. We requested the plasmids, and they were in our lab in just a couple days. The plasmids also came with a host of information on how best to use them. Thank you Dr. Lynne Regan!
Our amazing advisors
Dr. Brian Hammer and Dr. Mark Styczynski not only kept up with the administrative red tape required to make our team possible, but provided us with support week after week. Dr. Hammer specifically helped out with the cloning troubleshooting, and Dr. Styczynski help us work out the kinks in our modeling. We couldn't have done it without you.
Dr. Patrick Bardill took on iGEM as his personal responsibility to make sure that us undergrads had all the tools we needed to succeed. Anytime we needed him he would drop everything and help us for as long as we needed.
Samit Watve not only gave invaluable counsel with regards to the ins and outs of iGEM, but he also helped us troubleshoot issues with our cloning all summer long.
Youssef Chahibi was a great resource with regards to modeling.
Special Thanks
MoNaCo
Thank you to the  NSF-funded MoNaCo (Molecular Nano-Communications Networks) project which provided additional support. Check out their site here .
Hammer Lab Members
We also want to thank Elena Antonova from the Hammer lab for providing us with pictures for the home page, and Elsa Zhao, also from the Hammer Lab, for giving moral support and advice on weekends and late at night while everyone else was gone.
Sponsors
The President's Undergraduate Research Award (PURA) Paid a stipend for three of our team members this semester, and paid for all five of our travel expenses to the regional jamboree.
The Biology and Biomedical Engineering programs at Georgia Tech paid our registration for the jamboree.
Dr. Mark Styczynski and Dr. Brian Hammer were both awarded grants specifically to help us pay for our costs.
