In order for the cross-feeding scheme to work we need each strain to export the amino acid they produce (either Histidine or Tryptophan). To achieve this we created a devices design to secrete to the medium an His (or Trp) rich peptides.
Basic DNA structure of the devices with their constitutive parts
Kozak consensus sequence for initiation of translation.
Signal peptide that targets the product of the gene for secretion.
Trojan peptide to increase internalization in target cell.
Payload: this is the exported amino acid rich domain of the protein.
The input of the devices are PoPS and the output is secreted amino acids, so the devices are PoPS -> exported AA transducers. In principle any PoPS generating part can be used.

We built 2 His-export devices, and 2 Trp-export devices:
His-export I (<partinfo>BBa_K792009</partinfo>)
Trp export I (<partinfo>BBa_K792010</partinfo>)
His-export II (<partinfo>BBa_K792011</partinfo>)
Trp export II (<partinfo>BBa_K792012</partinfo>)
To achive this, we had to create several new basic biobricks:
Kozak sequence from yeast α-factor mating pheromone (MFα1) (<partinfo>BBa_K792001</partinfo>)
Secretion tag from yeast α-factor mating pheromone (MFα1) (<partinfo>BBa_K792002</partinfo>)
HIV TAT penetratin (<partinfo>BBa_K792003</partinfo>)
Polyarginine trojan peptide (<partinfo>BBa_K792004</partinfo>)
PolyHa, a Histidine rich peptide (His-Tag) (<partinfo>BBa_K792005</partinfo>)
TrpZipper2, a Tryptophan rich peptide water soluble and monomeric (<partinfo>BBa_K792006</partinfo>)
PolyHb, a stable Histidine rich peptide designed by us (<partinfo>BBa_K792007</partinfo>)
PolyWb, a stable Tryptophan rich peptide designed by us(<partinfo>BBa_K792008</partinfo>)
