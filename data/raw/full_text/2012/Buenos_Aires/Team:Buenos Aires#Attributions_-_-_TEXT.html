Attributions
Peptides of payload devices PolyHb and PolyWb were designed by team instructors, although students got their dna sequences by retro translation, and added the parts to the registry
DNA was synthesized by IDT.
All yeast strains we worked with, and some reactants and equipment, were kindly provided by Alejandro Colman-Lerner's Lab.
Everything not mentioned explicitly before was done by student members of the team (with the advisors supervision)
