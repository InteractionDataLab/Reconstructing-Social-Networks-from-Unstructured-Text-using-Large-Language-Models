From iGEM: You should make use of the calendar feature on the wiki and start a lab notebook.  This may be looked at by the judges to see how your work progressed throughout the summer.  It is a very useful organizational tool as well.
We might do that eventually. For now, we can keep track of progress here.
6/4: Last night I finally proved uniqueness for the steady-state equations for TALOR systems. The good news: that's done. The bad news: TALORs cannot build bistable systems without some other component. The model used also applies to TFOs.
6/19: A 1991 paper reported successful use of TFOs with regions designed to dimerize. The two TFOs form a much more stable triplex after dimerization, exactly as needed for bistable circuit design. The downside is that it requires DNA oligos, and I have no idea how those come about in vivo.
