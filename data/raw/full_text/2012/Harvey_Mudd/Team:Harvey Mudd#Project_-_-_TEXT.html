Overall project
Our goal is to build a simple, flexible and effective digital signal buffer. In electronics, buffers can be used to make a high signal higher and a low signal lower, and to isolate different wires. Our buffer will also make a high signal "higher" and a low signal "lower", so that a buffer with its own output fed back into its input forms a bistable system. We have not yet decided whether the buffer will connect different "wires" (chemical signals), or whether it will amplify a single chemical signal. Additional objectives are for the buffer to stabilize its own output and to smooth noise in the input signal. We would like our part(s) to be easily adaptable to many systems. In addition to creating the part(s), we will explore physical limits on the efficacy of buffering chemical signals beyond those imposed by information theory.
