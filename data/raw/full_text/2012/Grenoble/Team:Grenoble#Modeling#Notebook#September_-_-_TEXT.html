September
Week 36 • Week 37 • Week 38
Week 36: September 03rd to 09th
Goal
new study with the stochastic modeling : adaptation of the scripts
Continuation of the redaction for the stochastic part
A final check for the receptor parameters
Pooling the modeling parts
Conclusion
Regarding the stochastic modeling, the first part of the script has been modified and we are working on its optimization. The redaction progresses slowly. Once the receptor’s parameters checked, we had to pool the signaling and the amplification models. We could thus estimate the sensitivity as well as the rapidity of our system.
Week 37: September 10th to 16th
Goal
End of the stochastic changes
Prepare our midi-minatec talk
Conclusion
Unfortunately, because of a presentation to prepare, we didn't find time to end that stochastic modeling. The modeling team worked hard during this week to choose which results were worth presenting and which not. Then we thought with the biologists of a clear and simple way of presenting our work and making synthetic biology accessible even for uninitiated. You can visit the section Human practice- promoting synthetic biology to know more about this event.
Week 38: September 17th to 23rd
Goal
End of the stochastic modeling and analyse of the results
End of the redaction for the stochastic part
Prepare the modeling section and put our main results on line
Conclusion
The stochastic modeling is definitely finished and the whole stochastic part in the wiki is written with analyses on the results. Most parts of the modeling section are ready and put online. As for us, we tried to make it as clear as possible. Hope you’ll enjoy it.
