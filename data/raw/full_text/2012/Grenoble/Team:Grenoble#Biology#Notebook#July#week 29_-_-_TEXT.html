Week 27 • Week 28 • Week 29 • Week 30
Week 29: July 16th to 22nd
Goal of the week:
We wanted to test the Gibson Assembly and the transformation protocols, recover and amplify some biobricks involved in our genetic networks:
pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP (1300bp)
RBS_Cya (2600bp)
fha1 (80bp)
eCFP (800bp)
pSB4K5 (2400bp)
Monday, July 16th:
Precultured cells are prepared:
Strains = BW25113 WT and BW25113 cya- pAra/Bad
Conditions = LB liquid medium, 37°C, 200rpm, overnight
Tuesday, July 17th:
Using iGEM 2012 biobricks and the Gibson Assembly products we transformed ( protocol ) BW25113 WT cells. We obtained four transformed strains with:
BBa_I13601: pLAC_RBS
BBa_E0422: eCFP
GA: pLAC_rsmY (pSB1A3)
GA: pLAC_RBS_RsmA (pSB3C5)
We did a miniprep ( protocol ) on 2 strains, on which we wanted to recover pSB4K5 and the plasmid with pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP:
transformed strain with pSB4K5
BW25113 cya- pAra/Bad
We did PCRs with HF Phusion enzyme ( protocol ) on this miniprep in order to amplify pSB4K5, and from colony to amplify pLAC (fha), pLAC (rsmY), pLAC_RBS, fha and pSB4K5. We did the PCR both with and without DMSO.
To separate ( protocol ) the PCR products and the miniprep products, we prepared a 1.8% TAE agarose gel.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .

Wednesday, July 18th:
We did PCRs with HF Phusion enzyme ( protocol ) on a miniprep (12/07/17) in order to amplify pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP, on colony (iGEM Grenoble 2011) to amplify fha1, and on glycerol stock (BW25113 WT) to amplify RBS_Cya. We did the PCR both with and without DMSO.
To separate ( protocol ) the PCR products, we prepared a 1.8% TAE agarose gel.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .

We didn’t see anything. The PCR didn’t work.
We did PCRs with HF Phusion enzyme ( protocol ) on miniprep (12/07/17) in order to amplify pSB4K5, and on 2 colonies (iGEM Grenoble 2011) to amplify fha1. We did the PCR both with and without DMSO.
To separate ( protocol ) the PCR products, we prepared a 1.8% TAE agarose gel.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .
No result. (data not shown)
Using biobricks from the 2012 iGEM kit and our Gibson Assemblies product we transformed with a new protocol BW25113 WT competent cells protocol ). We obtained eight transformed strains with:
lux pR (BBa_R0062)
LuxI (BBa_C0061)
LuxR (BBa_I0462)
eCFP (BBa_E0022)
eCFP (BBa_E0422)
pLAC_RBS (BBa_I13601)
GA: pLAC_rsmY (pSB1A3)
GA: pLAC_RBS_RsmA (pSB3C5)
Thursday, July 19th:
Six transformations (12/07/18) out of eight showed results: RsmA, lux pR, LuxI, LuxR, E0422, E0022.
We did a miniprep ( protocol ) on these transformed strains (12/07/18): RsmA, lux pR, LuxI, LuxR, E0422, E0022.
We also did some digestions ( protocol ) in order to check if the Gibson Assembly product (pLAC_RBS_RsmA) is the right one. The digestions were realised with two restriction enzymes : XbaI and SpeI during 10 minutes.
To separate ( protocol ) the digestion products, we prepared a 1.8% TAE agarose gel.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .

Lane 4: GA (pLAC_RBS_RsmA) digestion product (XbaI & SpeI)
Lane 5: DNA ladder 100bp (biolabs)
We concluded that the Gibson Assembly (pLAC_RBS_RsmA on pSB1A3) worked. The digestion result is the expected one.
We did PCRs with HF Phusion enzyme ( protocol ) from minipreps in order to amplify pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP (12/07/17), eCFP (E0022 et E0422) (12/07/19). And a colony PCR to amplify RBS_Cya. We did the PCR both with and without DMSO.
To separate ( protocol ) the PCR products, we prepared a 1.3% TAE agarose gel.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .

We saw primer dimer bands and the bands corresponding to the amplified plasmids which brought eCFP (E0022 & E0422). There was a PCR condition problem.
One transformation (12/07/18) showed result during the day: rsmY. We decided to relaunch it in fresh LB medium + antibiotics.
Friday, July 20th:
We did a miniprep ( protocol ) on the transformed strains (12/07/18) with Gibson Assembly product (RsmA and rsmY).
In order to check the products of Gibson Assembly (RsmA and rsmY) we launched digestion ( protocol ) experiments on these miniprep products, using restriction enzymes (EcoRI, BamHI, XbaI and SpeI) during 10 minutes. We also launched digestion ( protocol ) experiments on the eCFP miniprep products (12/07/19), using the same restriction enzymes, in order to recover the eCFP coding sequence.
To separate ( protocol ) these digestion products, we prepared a 1.8% TAE agarose gel.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .

On these extractions, we did PCRs with HF Phusion enzyme ( protocol ) in order to amplify eCFP. We did the PCR both with and without DMSO.
To separate ( protocol ) the PCR products and the digestion products, we prepared a 1.3% TAE agarose gel.

We did PCRs with HF Phusion enzyme ( protocol ) in order to amplify pSB4K5 and fha from miniprep. We did the same PCR twice: one with DMSO and one without.
Conclusion of the week:
We have achieved our first Gibson Assembly : pLAC_RBS_RsmA on pSB3C5 and we began the experiments in order to recover luxpR, LuxI and LuxR (for the 1st network).
