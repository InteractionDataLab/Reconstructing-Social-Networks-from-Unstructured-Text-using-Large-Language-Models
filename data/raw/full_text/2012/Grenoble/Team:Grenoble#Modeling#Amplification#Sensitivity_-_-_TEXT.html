Explanation 1
AraC and Ca:
Once the production of AraC has been activated, we have:
In addition, we assume that p_AraC  ≪v_mAraC  thus, we get:
In addition we know that the maximum number of copies per cell of AraC is 40, thus
where
Avogadro number and
is E. coli volume. Thus, we have
. Then, we get the value of
. For the adenylate cyclase, but we assumed that there is less adenylate cyclase in the cell than AraC. Indeed, when there is too much cAMP is inhibits the production of the adenylate cyclase [6] .
CRP:
We have 1000 copies per cell of CRP, and it’s a constant. Then by the same computation, we make the conversion into mol.L-1, and we get the value of CRP.
Explanation 2
We do not know the value of the synthesis rate of adenylate cyclase, but we assume that there is less adenylate cyclase, because if there is a huge amont of adenylate cyclase, there will too much cAMP, and then cAMP will repress the adenylate cyclase production [6] . For the basal production, we make the same assumption as for AraC.
Explanation 3
Activations by (CRP-cAMP):
To set the value of this parameter, we plotted the concentration of (CRP-cAMP) at t=2000 min as we varied the initial concentration of cAMP:
Evolution of (CRP-cAMP) concentration at t=2000 minutes in function of the initial concentration of cAMP.
We could notice that the maximum value of (CRP-cAMP) varied between 0 and 10-6 mol.L-1. The value of the threshold had to be in this range of concentration. Not too low, else it would have meant that the proteins are always produced, and not to high, else the genes would never be expressed. In addition we assumed that AraC had to be activated first and without amplification of cAMP, seing that it is only when arac is expressed the adenylate cyclase is produced. Remark: when we have [cAMP]>> 10-6 mol/L=[CRP], we have by the same reasoning as for AraC:
and we have
when [cAMP] increases. Thus, in this case we could be sure that the concentration of (CRP-cAMP) wouldn’t exceed 10-6 mol.L-1.  In addition, when [cAMP]≤10-6 mol/L, we also know that because of the value of [CRP], [(CRP-cAMP)] wouldn’t exceed this threshold.
Activation by AraC*:
Same reasoning, we give the same type of graph:
We could set the value of K'Ca.
Explanation 4
Inspired from AraC. By discussing with the biologists we concluded that Ca is also a stable protein.
Explanation 5
By discussing with the biologists, we assumed that there is around 10 times more cAMP out of the cell than inside the cell.
Explanation 6
In the reference [6] , we have kcat=100 min-1 in vitro. However, by discussing with the biologists, we assumed that in vivo this value was higher.

We assumed that they would not be glued together, but not too far at the same time.
Explanation 2
We work above the threshold, because we want to know the speed of the diffusion when we have a detection.
