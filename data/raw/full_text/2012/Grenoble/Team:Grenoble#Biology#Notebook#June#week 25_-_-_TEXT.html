Week 25: June 18th to 24th
After a meeting with our instructors, we decided to work on a second amplifier (cAMP-CRP system). We designed the genetic network for the second amplifier according to results we found in the literature:
We looked for the biobricks involved in this network and we designed the primers for both amplifiers (RsmA-rsmY and cAMP-CRP systems) that we wanted to test in parallel.
We looked for the plasmids on which we wanted to insert the selected biobricks in order to construct the amplifiers and to test them.
We searched in the literature to find a way to build a detection module.
