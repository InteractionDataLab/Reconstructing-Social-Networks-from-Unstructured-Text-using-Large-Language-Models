Engineering studies in the field of Mathematics and Computer Science, 3rd year (equivalent of master 2)
Presentation
I've always loved mathematics. I wanted to take part in IGEM because I think that it is a great opportunity to discover the field of synthetic biology, which is in my point of view a forward looking sector. I am now beginning my last year of study, which I will do at Imperial College London in the mathematical department.
More about me
As I said I really like mathematics, especially numerical and combinatorial optimisation, topology, probability and statistics. I've been responsible of the whole modeling part in the IGEM project.In particular, i've done the amplification module alone, except the stochastic part on which Julie Herrbach worked with my help. I don't know yet if I want to work in  research or not, but I would like to be able to use my skills in synthetic biology or maybe aeronautical or energy field. Thus, I want to undertake a phd at the end of this year.
