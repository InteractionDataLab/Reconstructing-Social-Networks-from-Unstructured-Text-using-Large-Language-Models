It plays a key role in making Grenoble one of the most attractive scientific and industrial location worldwide. Moreover, Grenoble INP is the biggest « grande Ecole » in France.
</P><P>This school was born in the Alpine environment and was founded in 1900 with the Electrical Engineering Institute. It grew all over the years and became INPG in 1971 with Louis Néel, Nobel Laureate in Physics, as its first President.
</P><P>Today, Grenoble INP possesses 6 skills center :</P><DIV style="display: inline-block;"><UL><LI>Energy</LI><LI>Environment</LI><LI>Information and communication</LI><LI>Materials</LI><LI>Micro &amp; Nanotechnologies</LI><LI>Production Systems</LI></UL></DIV><P>Those skills are shared out between 6 schools.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H2 id="4">Minatec</H2><P>Minatec (Micro and Nanotechnology) is the first European research center focused on micro-nano technologies. Minatec’s research adresses vital issues in the fields of health care, energy and communication in order to find solutions to the economic, technological and environmental challenges facing modern society.</P><P>Minatec has sparked a multitude of new businesses developing micro and nanotechnology applications in optronics, biotech, components, circuit design and motion sensing fields.</P><P>This scientific center brings together fundamental research labs, a major technological research lab (Léti) and Start-ups.
Minatec is an International hub for micro and nanotechnology research.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H2 id="5">INRIA</H2><P>Public science and technology institution established in 1967, Inria is is the only public research body fully dedicated to computational sciences. Combining computer sciences with mathematics, Inria’s 3,400 researchers strive to invent the digital technologies of the future.</P><P>Educated at leading international universities, they creatively integrate basic research with applied research and dedicate themselves to solving real problems, collaborating with the main players in public and private research in France and abroad and transferring the fruits of their work to innovative companies. The researchers at Inria published over 4,800 articles in 2010. They are behind over 270 active patents and 105 start-ups. In 2010, Inria’s budget came to 252.5 million euros, 26% of which represented its own resources.</P></SECTION><SECTION><H2 id="6">EPN Science Campus</H2><P>The EPN (European Photon and Neutron) Science Campus is an international science hub in Grenoble, hosting 3 major European Institutes :</P><P>The EPN Science Campus builds upon the co-location of the world’s most powerful neutron source, the ILL, and the world’s premier photon source, the ESRF.
Those 2 Institutes make their facilities available to visiting scientists from 19 member countries and all over the world.</P><P>The Grenoble outstation of the EMBL on the Campus has a scientific programme strongly related to the neighbouring neutron and photon facilities.</P><P>Ground breaking experiments at the very frontier of current research take place on the Campus in fields as far apart as structural biology, fundamental physics, material science and environmental studies.</P><P>The Institute operates the most intense neutron source in the world, feeding intense beams of neutrons to a suite of 40 high-performance instruments that are constantly upgraded.
Research focuses primarily on fundamental science in a variety of fields : condensed matter physics, chemistry, biology, nuclear physics and material science.</P><P>ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) operates the most powerful synchrotron radiation source in Europe.
