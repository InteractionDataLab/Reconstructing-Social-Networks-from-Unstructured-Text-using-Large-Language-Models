Training
engineering studies in the prevention of industrial risks, occupational health and environment (beginning my 3rd year of engineering school = M2)
Presentation
Interdisciplinarity, this is what I want to reach. Before beginning my study as a real student, I passed my baccalaureat in science, with the specialty biology and physics. After this I did two-year highly selective classes to prepare for the competitive exams to the Grandes Ecoles. Then I did a first year in the engineering school of the University of Grenoble 1. Currently I am in the second year and I intend to improve my skills.
Future projects
After my last year at Polytech Grenoble and my diploma as an engineer in prevention of risk, I will do a master of management in the specialty of business administration. Then I would like to work in the field of transport and more precisely with trains. What is the link with synthetic biology? None, but biological risks are everywhere. Thus this experience is a plus for me.  And as I wrote before, interdisciplinarity, this is what I want to reach.
