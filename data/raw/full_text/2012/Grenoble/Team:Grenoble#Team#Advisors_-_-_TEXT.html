Geoffrey Bouchage
Grenoble INP - Phelma
"Trust me, I'm an engineer."
Jean-Baptiste Lugagne
Grenoble INP - Phelma
I recently finished my studies in signal processing. Last year, I participated to the competition with the Grenoble team and got hooked up in the first few months. I continued in this domain and, with my skills in applied maths, statistics and computer science, joined the so-called 'second wave' of synthetic biology. The competition is an exceptional opportunity, both on the human and scientific level, and I think it's important for people like me to reach back and help other students have the same chances again.
Stéphane Pinhal
PhD student in Systems and Synthetic Biology
Interested in engineering the living, I joined the iGEM Paris Liliane Bettencourt 2010 team. I think iGEM is very formative on both scientific and human side. So I couldn't miss this adventure. We won the Best Foundational Advance Prize. In 2011, I was the advisor of the iGEM Grenoble team. It was a new challenge because it was the fist participation of a team from Grenoble. I shared my experience with them and help them to reach the Final. In order to have a place where you can talk and share about Synthetic Biology, I've founded the first club of Synthetic Biology in Grenoble: SynBioGre. This year, I'm an advisor of the iGEM Grenoble team … again! Rise and shine Grenoble 2012 ! ;)
Valentin Zulkower
PhD student in Systems Biology
I was trained as an engineer in Paris and spent two years eating schnitzels and statistics in Vienna, Austria. Meanwhile a personal project ( a cat with dust-adhesive hair... ) turned me into a synthetic biology enthusiast, and further readings led me to a Ph.D. in systems biology at the INRIA, in Grenoble. In short, I am a Mowgli maths nerd raised by biologists !
