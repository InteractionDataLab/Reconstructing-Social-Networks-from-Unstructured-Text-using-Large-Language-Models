Week 31 • Week 32 • Week 33 • Week 34 • Week 35
Week 32: August 06th to 12th
Goal of the week:
Assembly of pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP and RBS_Cya.
Monday, August 06th:
We wanted to check if the Gibson Assemblies (12/08/01) worked well.
To separate ( protocol ) the GA miniprep (12/08/03) products, we prepared a 1.8% TAE agarose gel.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .
Migration result for a 1.8% TAE agarose gel
(the DNA ladder scale is in kb)
Lane 1: pLAC_rsmY (pSB1A3) 3 miniprep product
Lane 2: pLAC_rsmY (pSB1A3) 2 miniprep product
Lane 3: pLAC_rsmY (pSB1A3) 1 miniprep product
Lane 4: pLAC_fha1_eCFP (pSB4C5) 2 miniprep product
Lane 5: pLAC_fha1_eCFP (pSB4C5) 1 miniprep product
Lane 6: DNA ladder 1kb (biolabs)
Lane 7: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB3C5) 1 miniprep product
Lane 8: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB3C5) 2 miniprep product
Lane 9: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 4 miniprep product
Lane 10: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 3 miniprep product
Lane 11: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 1 miniprep product
Lane 12: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 2 miniprep product
Lane 13: DNA ladder 1kb (biolabs)
We did some digestions ( protocol ) on GA miniprep (12/08/03). The digestions were achieved with XbaI during 10 minutes.
To separate ( protocol ) the digestion products, we prepared two 1.8% TAE agarose gels.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .
Migration result for a 1.8% TAE agarose gel
(the DNA ladder scale is in kb)

(the DNA ladder scale is in kb)
Lane 1: DNA ladder 1kb (biolabs)
Lane 2: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 4 digestion product
Lane 3: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 4 miniprep product
Lane 4: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 1 digestion product
Lane 5: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 1 miniprep product
Lane 6: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 2 digestion product
Lane 7: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 2 miniprep product
Lane 8: DNA ladder 80pb-10kb (fermentas)
The digestions showed no significant results.
Thursday, August 07th:
We did some verification PCRs on miniprep with HF Phusion enzyme ( protocol ) in order to check the constructions.
To separate ( protocol ) the PCR products, we prepared a 1.8% TAE agarose gel.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .
The PCR showed no significant results (data not shown).
Wednesday, August 08th:
We did some digestions ( protocol ) in order to check the construction: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya and to do the construcion: pompC_mcherry.
We did an overlapping PCR on miniprep with HF Phusion enzyme ( protocol ) in order to do the construction: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya.
To separate ( protocol ) the PCR products and the digestion products, we prepared 1.8% TAE agarose gels.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .
The digestions experiments worked well, the PCR didn't work (data not shown).
Tuesday, August 09th:
We did some colony PCRs with HF Phusion enzyme ( protocol ) in order amplify RBS_Cya and pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP.
We realised a Gibson Assembly ( protocol ) to build: pSB3C5 with pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP and RBS_Cya.
With our Gibson Assembly products, we transformed (new protocol ) BW25113 Cya- competent cells ( protocol ).
We did an overlapping PCR on miniprep with HF Phusion enzyme ( protocol ) in order to do the construction: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya.
It showed no significant result (data not shown).
Friday, August 10th:
We relaunched in fresh LB the cultures of transformed cells made the day before (12/08/09).
We did a miniprep ( protocol ) on these transformed strains.
Conclusion of the week:
We didn't achieved to construct: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya.
