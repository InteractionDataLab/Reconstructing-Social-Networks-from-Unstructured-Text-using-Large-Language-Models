Grenoble INP - Phelma
Training
Engineering studies in the field of Physics specialized, 2nd year
Presentation
I have always been passionated about science and wanted this passion to become my work. I quickly found a particular affinity with physics. That's why I did a baccalaureat in engineering sciences. Then I did an intense training in physics, mathematics and mecanics for 2 years in order to integrate my current engineering school Phelma. I begin now my specialization in nanosciences.
More about me
I still have two years before I graduate. I am going to spend my second year of engineering school at Imperial College London before coming back in Grenoble. Then I will probably spend three more years of studying to do a PhD in nanosciences. This field could bring me in research and I am also really interested in working as an engineer.
