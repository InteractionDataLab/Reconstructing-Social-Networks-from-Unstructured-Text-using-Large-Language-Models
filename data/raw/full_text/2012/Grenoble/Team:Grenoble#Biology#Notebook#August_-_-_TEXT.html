Week 31 • Week 32 • Week 33 • Week 34 • Week 35
Week 31: July 30th to August 05th
Goal of the week:
We wanted to recover and amplify some biobricks involved in our genetic networks:
pSB4C5 (2400bp)
pompC (100bp)
mcherry (900bp)
eCFP (800bp)
GFP (800bp)
Tuesday, July 31th:
We did a miniprep ( protocol ) on the transformed strain with pSB4C5 (12/07/25), on which we wanted to recover pSB4C5.
We did some colony PCRs (on 12/07/25 colony) and PCRs on miniprep with HF Phusion enzyme ( protocol ) in order to amplify pSB4C5.
Annealing temperature = 60°C.
To separate ( protocol ) the PCR products, we prepared a 1.8% TAE agarose gel.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .

We did some digestions ( protocol ) on miniprep (pSB4C5) in order to do the construction: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya. The digestions were achieved with two restriction enzymes : XbaI and SpeI during 10 minutes.
To separate ( protocol ) the PCR products and the digestion products, we prepared a 1.8% TAE agarose gel.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.

pSB3C5 (Cya) 120713PP_PCR_015 with pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP 120727AM_PCR_023 and RBS_Cya 120727AM_PCR_022
pSB4C5 120731AM_DIG_027 with pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP 120727AM_PCR_023 and RBS_Cya 120727AM_PCR_022
For each plasmid construct, we did two Gibson Assemblies ( protocol ).
We transformed ((new protocol ) BW25113 WT competent cells ( protocol ) with the GA products:
pLAC_fha1_eCFP and pLAC_rsmY.
We transformed ((new protocol ) BW25113 Cya- competent cells ( protocol ) with the GA products:
pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya.
We did some minipreps ( protocol ) on the transformed strains (12/07/25) with pOmpC, mcherry, eCFP and pSB4C5 ; in order to set up the test on the receptor with a reporter.
Then, we did some digestions ( protocol ) on these minipreps. The digestions were achieved with two restriction enzymes:
pOmpC with EcoRI and SpeI during 10 minutes
mcherry and eCFP with XbaI and SpeI during 10 minutes
pSB4C5 with EcoRI and PstI during 10 minutes
To separate ( protocol ) the digestion products, we prepared a 1.8% TAE agarose gel.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .

There was a problem with the miniprep or the transformation, we didn't see any DNA bands.
With iGEM 2012 biobricks we transformed (new protocol ) BW25113 WT competent cells ( protocol ) with pOmpC.
We decided to relaunch the transformed strains with the GA products (12/08/01) in fresh liquid LB.
Friday, August 03rd:
We did some minipreps ( protocol ) on the transformed strains with the GA products.
We did some glycerol stocks :
GA: pLAC_rsmY (pSB1A3) 1 120803GH_016
GA: pLAC_fha1_eCFP (pSB4C5) 1 120803GH_017
GA: pLAC_fha1_eCFP (pSB4C5) 2 120803GH_018
GA: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB3C5) 1 120803GH_019
GA: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 1 120803GH_020
GA: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB3C5) 2 120803GH_021
GA: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 2 120803GH_022
GA: pLAC_rsmY (pSB1A3) 2 120803GH_023
GA: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 3 120803GH_024
GA: pLAC_rsmY (pSB1A3) 3 120803GH_025
GA: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 4 120803GH_026
GA: pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP_RBS_Cya (pSB4C5) 5 120803GH_027
We decided to replace eCFP with mcherry, then we had to design the construction pLAC_fha1_mcherry and to design the primers used for this construction.
We also designed the primers used for the receptor construction: pCons(BBa_J23119)_RBS_Tap/EnvZ.
Conclusion of the week:
We replaced eCFP with mcherry GFP.
We have achieved to amplify pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP // RBS_Cya // fha // pSB4C5 (fha) and we began the experiments in order to recover pOmpC (for the detection module) and pConst.
We decided to focus on the system with the pAra/Bad "AND" gate.
