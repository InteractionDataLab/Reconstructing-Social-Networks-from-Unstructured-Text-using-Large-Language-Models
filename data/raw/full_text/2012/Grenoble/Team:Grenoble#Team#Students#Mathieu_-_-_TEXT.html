Presentation
Hello everyone ! I am Mathieu and I am crazy about molecular biology and biotechnology, that is why I joined the Grenoble IGEM team. To my mind, iGEM is an opportunity to work on a science project and to share knowledge with people from different training. Furthermore It is also a great human adventure and an unforgettable international challenge.
