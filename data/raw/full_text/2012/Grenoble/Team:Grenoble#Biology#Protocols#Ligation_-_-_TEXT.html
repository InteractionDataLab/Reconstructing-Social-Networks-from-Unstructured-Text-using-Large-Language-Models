Ligation
Goal
Ligate two DNA fragments cut using restriction enzymes .
Protocol
Following are the instructions from the NEB website .
In an eppendorf tube, introduce :
1 µL of T4 DNA ligase
2 µL of T4 DNA ligase buffer (10X)
4 µL (50 ng) of DNA vector
12 µL (50 ng) of DNA insert
to 20 µL of water
SAFETY AND USEFUL RECOMMANDATION
Those products are not dangerous at first sight, but in case of spreading                 or contacts with any part of the body, it is recommended to wash this part and                 to dry it after.  Use a different pipette tip for each sample. It is also important to                 close tubes after putting the different reagents. DNA is more sensitive to its environment while it is not circulared in a plasmid and introduced                 into a cell. Therefore, a spreading has very few chances to lead to any bad consequences.
Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
