Presentation
As far as I remember I have always been interested in science, especially in biology : "how does it work ?" was my favorite question. I like to learn and understand new things and I am very open-minded. Next year I will graduate with a Master in nanobiology and nanobiotechnology and I am looking forward to do a PhD in this field. I would love to go abroad during these last years of study.
More about me
I grew up in the Alps and as a true "haute alpine" I like mountain and sport. I like challenges and that's why I'm very happy and excited by the iGEM adventure !
