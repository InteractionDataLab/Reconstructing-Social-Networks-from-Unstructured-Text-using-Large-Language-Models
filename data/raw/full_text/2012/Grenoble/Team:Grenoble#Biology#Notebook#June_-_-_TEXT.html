Week 23: June 04th to 10th
During this week we chose the project on which we wanted to work.
We decided to create a system which can detect a pathogene, like Staphylococcus aureus, for example.
We intend to build an ultra sensitive detector. The goal is to produce a detector which can greatly amplify an extremely low input signal. It consists of three modules:
the first gets the signal
the second amplifies it
the third sends the output
The detection module is a membrane receptor that once activated by a biomolecule actuates an amplification loop. The loop enhances the cell response efficiency.
The amplification system contains a genetic feed forward loop. It acts as a biologic loud filter aiming at reducing false positive outputs. Once amplified and filtered the signal is transmitted to the neighboring bacteria. In this way a noticeable fluorescent emission is generated.
Scheme of the concept
