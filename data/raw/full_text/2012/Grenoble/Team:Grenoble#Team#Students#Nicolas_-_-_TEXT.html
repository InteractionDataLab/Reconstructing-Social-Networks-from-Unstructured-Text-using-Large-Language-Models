Engineering studies in the field of Mathematics and Computer Science, 2nd year
Presentation
I am in second year of Mathematics and Computer Science Engineering, I am studying graphic modelisation, operating systems and mathematics for optimisation and modeling. I have always been interested in how different fields of science could cooperate, iGEM was a unique chance to discover it. I think it is going to be an awesome experience, I cannot wait to be in Boston!
More about me
As a lot of students in Grenoble I love skiing, mountain biking and Chartreuse, but as I was born in the south of France I also love sleeping a lot all day long !
