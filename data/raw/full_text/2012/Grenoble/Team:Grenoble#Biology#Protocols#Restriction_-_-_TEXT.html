Restriction enzyme digestion of DNA
Goal
Digest DNA in order to perform a ligation or to check a construction.
Enzymes
XbaI
SpeI
PstI
EcoRI
Protocol
Set up the water bath at 37°C.
In an eppendorf tube, introduce :
2 µL of each restriction enzyme
10 µL of NEB 2 buffer
1 µL of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)
variable volume of template DNA
to 50 µL of water
SAFETY AND USEFUL RECOMMANDATION
Those products are not dangerous at first sight, but in case of spreading                 or contacts with any part of the body, it is recommended to wash this part and                 to dry it after.  Use a different pipette tip for each sample. It is also important to                 close tubes after putting the different reagents. DNA is more sensitive to its environment while it is not circulared in a plasmid and introduced                 into a cell. Therefore, a spreading has very few chances to lead to any bad consequences.
Put the eppendorf tube into the water bath.
Incubate at 37°C for 15 minutes.
