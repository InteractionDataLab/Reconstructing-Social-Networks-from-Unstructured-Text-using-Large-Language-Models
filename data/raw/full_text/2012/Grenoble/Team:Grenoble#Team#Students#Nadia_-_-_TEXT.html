Presentation
What I find extremely fascinating about science is the interdisciplinary approach. It makes you learn about other science fields and open your mind to different methods and different ways of thinking. So when I heard about the iGEM competition, I just could not ignore the appeal of synthetic biology, a totally unexplored field for me.
More about me
Now I am studying materials science at Grenoble Institute of Technology-Phelma. Next, I aim to specialize in the study of nano-materials and undertake a PhD. I’m also interested in travelling and discovering different cultures. So I will mainly try to look for an internship and probably a M2 and/or a PhD abroad. I hope materials science will give me the opportunity to get a dynamic job that meets my ambitions.
