sEnsiColi: A tunable and reliable ultra-sensitive detector
Multi-resistant bacteria are a worldwide issue which in a very near future will have  huge impacts on our societies and ways diagnosis and prevention will be performed.  In this optic, the Grenoble iGEM team has built an ultra-sensitive pathogen detector.
It consists of three interconnected modules:
Detection
Amplification/Communication
Output
The detection module consists of a recombinant membrane receptor that, once activated, actuates an amplification loop. The amplification system contains a genetic feed forward loop, which filters out false  positive outputs. Once amplified and filtered, the signal is transmitted to neighboring  bacteria via a diffusible molecule. In turn, the amplification loop is triggered which  leads to the production of a measurable fluorescence output.
The design of our  network is easily adaptable to different input signals by using other receptor domains.
