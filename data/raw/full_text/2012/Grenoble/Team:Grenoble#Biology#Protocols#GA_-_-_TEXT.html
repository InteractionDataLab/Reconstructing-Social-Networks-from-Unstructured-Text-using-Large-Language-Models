Gibson Assembly
Goal
Assemble DNA fragments.
Mix preparation
Following are the instructions from the Synbio website .
Gibson Assembly reaction
Set up the thermocycler at 50°C for one hour.
In a 50 µL PCR tube, introduce :
15 µL of Master Mix (1.33 X)
5 µL of DNA fragments
Optimized cloning efficiency is 50-100 ng of vectors with 2-3 fold of excess inserts.   Use 5 times more of inserts if size is less than 200 bps.
SAFETY AND USEFUL RECOMMANDATION
Those products are not dangerous at first sight, but in case of spreading                 or contacts with any part of the body, it is recommended to wash this part and                 to dry it after.  Use a different pipette tip for each sample. It is also important to                 close tubes after putting the different reagents. DNA is more sensitive to its environment while it is not circulared in a plasmid and introduced                 into a cell. Therefore, a spreading has very few chances to lead to any bad consequences.
Put the 50 µL PCR tube into the thermocycler.
Turn on the device.
SAFETY AND USEFUL RECOMMANDATION
It was noticed that it exists a certain number of different thermocycler models.                 That is why biologists do not know, all the time, how the device they will use, has to be manipulated. This                 can present risks for thermocycler users. Indeed a thermocycler is an electric device which can become very hot,                 and in case of misused, people can be injured. Consequently it is very important for users to know how to use                 the device. It is recommended to read the operating instructions before using it. Besides, the device has protective measures to prevent                 accidents.
