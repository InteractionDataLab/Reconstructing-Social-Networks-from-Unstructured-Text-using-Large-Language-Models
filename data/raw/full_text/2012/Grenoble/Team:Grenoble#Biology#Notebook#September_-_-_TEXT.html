Week 36: September 03rd to September 09th
Goal of the week:
We tested the double mutant strains construction ( protocol ).
We did some verification colony PCRs with HF Phusion enzyme ( protocol ) in order to check the constructions.
To separate ( protocol ) the PCR products, we prepared a 1.8% TAE agarose gel.
Migration conditions = 100V during 30 min.
In order to reveal the DNA fragments, we used EtBr .
Migration result for a 1.8% TAE agarose gel
(the DNA ladder scale is in kb)
Lane 1:DNA ladder (Smart Ladder)
Lane 2: araC PCR product in WT strain
Lane 3: araC PCR product in ΔaraC ΔcyaA strains
Lane 4: envZ PCR product in WT strain
Lane 5: envZ PCR product in ΔenvZ ΔcyaA strains
Lane 6: cyaA PCR product in WT strain

Lane 2: cyaA PCR product in ΔenvZ ΔcyaA strains
Lane 3: cyaA PCR product in ΔaraC ΔcyaA strains
Lane 4: envZ PCR product in ΔenvZ ΔcyaA strains
Lane 5: araC PCR product in ΔaraC ΔcyaA strains
As the primers used for these PCRs were designed into the gene sequences, when there is no DNA bands, it shows that the knockout was efficient.
The double mutant constructions were confirmed.
