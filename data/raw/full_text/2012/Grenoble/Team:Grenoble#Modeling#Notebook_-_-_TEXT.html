June
Week 23 : We start our first modeling... Week 24 : Progression of ODEs and stability study Week 25 : An interesting week : precisions on the model, stochastic study, design... Week 26 : Beginning of the quorum sensing part and of the wiki redaction
July
Week 27 : We are completing our model Week 28 : Parameters, where are you ? Week 29 : I'm still looking for you... Week 30 : We are comparing theory with experiments
August
Week 31 : Beginning of the receptor modeling Week 32 : Parameters, you again ! Week 33 : Stochastic, equilibrium analysis, new receptor model... a busy week Week 34 : Who are the bad parameters ? Week 35 : Stochastic, equilibrium and receptor again
September
Week 36 : New ideas for the stochastic part Week 37 : A busy week preparing the midi-minatec talk Week 38 : It’s high time for putting online the modeling part
