Master 2 studies in Nanosciences, Nanobiology and Nanobiotechnologies.
Presentation
Since my childhood I have always been attracted by sciences in general. Later, I got more interested in biology and choose to  make my bachelor in this field. During the last year of my bachelor I encountered Nanobiotechnologies this triggered something in me. I realized that I wanted to work in this field. In this optic, I decided to do my Master 2 in Nanosciences at the Joseph Fourier University.
Future projects
After my graduation, I would like to continue with a PhD in the field of Nanobiotechnologies. I would like to work in research and development either in industrial or academic facilities.
