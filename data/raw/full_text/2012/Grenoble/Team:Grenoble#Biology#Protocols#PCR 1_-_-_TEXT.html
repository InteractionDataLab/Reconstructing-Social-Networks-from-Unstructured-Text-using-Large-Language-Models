PCR using a GoTaq® polymerase
Goal
Amplify a specific section of DNA.
Protocol
Following are the instructions from the Promega website .
Set up the thermocycler at the right temperatures.
In a 200 µL PCR tube, introduce :
1.25 µL of forward primer (10µM)
1.25 µL of reverse primer (10µM)
2.5 µL of dNTP (2 mM)
5 µL of GoTaq® Reaction Buffer
variable volume of template DNA
0.12 µL of GoTaq® polymerase
to 25 µL of nuclease-free water
SAFETY AND USEFUL RECOMMANDATION
Those products are not dangerous at first sight, but in case of spreading                 or contacts with any part of the body, it is recommended to wash this part and                 to dry it after.  Use a different pipette tip for each sample. It is also important to                 close tubes after putting the different reagents. DNA is more sensitive to its environment while it is not circulared in a plasmid and introduced                 into a cell. Therefore, a spreading has very few chances to lead to any bad consequences.
Put the 200 µL PCR tube into the thermocycler.
Turn on the device.
SAFETY AND USEFUL RECOMMANDATION
It was noticed that it exists a certain number of different thermocycler models.                 Each device has its own user guide which should be thoroughly read before using the device.    The use of Thermocyclers can present risks. Indeed it is an electric device which can become very hot,                 and in case of misused, people can be injured.
