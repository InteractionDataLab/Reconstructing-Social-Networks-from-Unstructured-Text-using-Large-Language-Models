Activities
Grenoble is a city of sports. Winter sports of course, ever since the 1968 Winter Olympics, but also sports for sunny days-cycling, mountain biking, hiking, team sports, gymnastics and aerobics, just to name a few.
Mountain
Just a few minutes from the heart of the city, the mountains are clearly up to our standards winter and summer alike for snow sports and hiking adventures. The Isere department and its numerous lakes and bodies of water are welcoming us for rowing, windsurfing, water skiing, or simply for a refreshing dip.
Whatever your projects or your desires, the exceptional natural setting of the city lets your choose the activities that most interest you. Familiy hike, nature walk starting in the city, an excursion across the Vercors or Chartreuse mountains on donkey back, snow shoe treks or dog sledding, even high mountain races for the most athletic : all of the mountain is accessible from Grenoble.
Breathtaking landscapes, plants, animals… nothing is missing from the magical settings of the natural parks. The diversity of the ladscapes is exceptional, marked by the hills and the plains along with lower and upper mountains.
The Isere department is an exceptional snow destination with a dozen resorts on the outskirts of Grenoble. At the crossroads of three valleys, Grenoble is less than thirty minutes from the superb ski resorts of the Dauphiné Alps.
As a student you will get reductions on ski lifts at Les 2 Alpes and Les 7 Laux.
