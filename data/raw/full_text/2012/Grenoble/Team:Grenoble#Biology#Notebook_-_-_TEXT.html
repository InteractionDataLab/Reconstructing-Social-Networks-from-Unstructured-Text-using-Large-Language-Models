Notebook
Greetings iGEMers, on these pages you will be able to read our lab book (for your greatest pleasure of course)(probably the next world's bestseller !!!). In order to make the notebook as easy to read as possible; we decided to divide it into groups (Months). Each of them are divided into  subgroups (Weeks). Each subgroup will have a short summary, so you don't have to get through the whole notebook in order to find the good stuff!
June
Week 23 : Choice and description of the project. Week 24 : RsmA-rsmY system (amplifier) design and research on a possible detection module. Week 25 : Second amplifier design (cAMP-CRP system). Week 26 : Detection module description. Planning of first experiments.
July
Week 27 : Test PCR conditions, recovering and amplifying the biobricks involved in our genetic networks --> no significant results. Week 28 : Recovery and amplification of the different biobricks --> Amplification of pLAC (fha1) // pLAC (rsmY) // pLAC_RBS // RsmA // rsmY // pSB1A3 // pSB3C5 (Cya) // pSB3C5 (RsmA). Week 29 : Gibson assembly, transformation, amplification and recovery of biobricks --> successful Gibson Assembly: pLAC_RBS_RsmA on pSB3C5. Week 30 : Amplification of pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP // RBS_Cya // fha // pSB4C5.
August
Week 31 : Amplification of pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP // RBS_Cya // fha // pSB4C5 (fha). Week 32 : Amplification and assembly of pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP // RBS_Cya. Week 33 : Amplification and assembly of pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP // RBS_Cya  and  pompC // mcherry and Tap // EnvZ. Week 34 : Amplification and assembly of pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP // RBS_Cya  and  pompC // mcherry and Tap // EnvZ. Week 35 : Amplification and assembly of pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP // RBS_Cya  and  pompC // mcherry and Tap // EnvZ. Start of the double mutant strains construction.
September
Week 36 : Amplification and assembly of pAra/Bad_RBS_GFP // RBS_Cya  and  pompC // mcherry and Tap // EnvZ. Double mutant strains construction.
