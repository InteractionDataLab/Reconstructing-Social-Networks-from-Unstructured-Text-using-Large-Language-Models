I like my resuspended cells shaken, not stirred, and if you ever meet me you had better hope not to meet the things that are coming after me.

Once while sailing around the world, He discovered a short cut.
Panhandlers give him money.
He does Calculus in his head.
Athletes seek his autograph.
His passport requires no photo.
He's never found a penny that wasn't heads up.
When he drives his new car off the lot it increases in value.
His 1913 Duesenberg still has that new car smell.
Dolphins love swimming with him.

My name is Patrick Bateman. I am twenty-six years old. I live in the American Garden Buildings on West Eighty-First Street, on the eleventh floor.I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the icepack, I use a deep pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub.Then I apply an herb mint facial masque which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after-shave lotion with little or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing "protective" lotion...There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an  entity, something illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you  and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable: I simply am not there.
