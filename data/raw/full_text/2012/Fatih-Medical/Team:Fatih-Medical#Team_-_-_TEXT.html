Ahmet Altınışık
The Militaryman
I’m a third grade medical student, what i believe in life is just trying and not to  get down so we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have been planning to specialize at neurogenetics so that i could make my dream happen, i’m glad to be the part of this organization and willing to meet other iGEMers.
Ayşe Demirci
Hopeless Case
Hi! I am second year medical student. Participating in iGEM is one of the greatest personal experiences I’ve ever had. The time I’ve spent during the lab works and other activities was very instructive for me in every sense.  Apart from science, music is an important part of my life. I've been playing the violin for 11 years in different orchestras.  I would like to thank our whole team for the fairy-tale summer and the great time we had together. And of course special thanks to our advisors and instructors for all their patience:)
Bora Vergül
The Big Shot
It is my job to do the things  that are almost impossible. I am the main actor to find funds for the  team via various ways. I am a regular player of Seafight, my major  source to find contacts. So, there is no need to worry, do the boring  lab works, I am taking care of your lunch in Amsterdam.

The Smiley
It was nice for our feet not to be turned backwards. :P My life philosophy is being happy, always happy and positive. It is meaningless to be upset and sad; especially still you can make huge fires in laboratory. Everything may change with only one contamination, so let’s put our fingers into the petri dishes!
Büşra Nur Aydın
PC Worm
Hi there, I’m second year student at medical school. My love to genetics brought me to iGEM. I usually deal with software and hardware tools of team. I’m also always responsible for making a list of lacking and necessary lab equipments. I like cooking but can’t resist eating. I get extreme adrenaline by riding my motorcycle.
Esma Ölmez
Lady Smile
I'm second year medical student. My lessons and medicine are pleasure for me.I find Synthetic Biology really challenging as it is limitless and involved in every major. I joined iGEM to learn more things about this developing branch of science. I take care of me and my team spending useful time in lab. Most of all I like making competent cell. Of course I have hobbies outside of this; swimming, watching movies and discovering new places are just some of them!
Fatma Betül Çevik
Chief Secretary
Hi! I’m second year medical student. I like my lessons without exceptions. I get excited by learning new things, especially in branches of science. I guess that’s why I take so much pleasure of iGEM studies (researches, experiments etc.). Furthermore, I think youths will achieve such incredible points in SynBio and in science as long as they are encouraged. I will try to be together with those young scientists which work with endless desire in every opportunity.
Maral Amangurbanova
Self-sacrifcing
Hi I have just finished second year of medical school. I've been addicted to iGEM since my first steps to university but only this year I have had a chance to be the part of this incredible team. After accidentally burning our precious bacteria while spreading the plate, mates got used to teasing me by calling ‘Bakteri Külbastı Ustası’ which in english means ‘Bacteria Cutlet Chef’. I’ve gained so much experience with iGEM, especially it woke up the spirit of endless research and explore in me. Besides I’m fanatical about astronomy and everything classic; books, music, clothes and etc.

For many years and frankly till nowadays my dream was to become surgeon but day by day I’m getting addicted to genetics due to iGEM. Good luck to every iGEMer.

SynBio and iGEM presents a wonderful opportunity world to make the life easier and more peaceful. So, being a part of this huge family is so precious.
Nazym Bashkenova
Team Brain
Third year medical student. In my high school years I was always interested in genetics and molecular biology. So when I heard about iGEM competition it didn’t take a long time for me to make a decision. . . and I had a privelege to participate in it. For me iGEM is an amazing experience where you can learn team work, lab work, social work and other intresting stuff of work. Also iGEM is a great opportunity to spend your summer with a lot of fun and benefit.
Ömür Cemal Kazaz
The Genuine
Hi! I am second class medical student at Fatih University. This means, I’m only 4 years away from my biggest dream to become a doctor:) I am a fierce fan of playing and watching football since my childhood. I have an additional favorite hobby since last year – playing the Ney (a turkish wind instrument). Being part of the Fatih-Medical team was my greatest  scientific experience but apart from all the science my biggest profit while working at this project was to have learned how to become a real team. I want to thank all my team mates for the amazing time we had together!
