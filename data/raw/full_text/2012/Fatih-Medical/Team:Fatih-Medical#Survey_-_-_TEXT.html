Survey Results
We prepared this survey to observe the awareness about synthetic biology in our society. We tried to share our survey exceeding the borders of our country, so we have conducted it in some foreigner countries.  We separated the survey results by the answers of the first question. We continued to evaluate other questions with the answers of those who assume that  they know synthetic biology or were clearly informed after our presentation. Almost everyone found synthetic biology not well developed in Turkey. So it proves that SynBio doesn’t have the necessary popularity in Turkey but despite all, our society looks hopeful to the development of SynBio. After short information within the survey we conclude that there is an increase of interest in iGEM and studies of synthetic biology.
1. Do you know Synthetic Biology?
2. Do you know the application areas of Synthetic Biology?
3. Are you aware of the potential of Synthetic Biology?
4. Do you think that Synthetic Biology is going to be an important part of our life in the future?
5. Besides the benefits which Synthetic Biology provides, are you ready to allow microorganisms to be a part of our life?
6. Do you find Synthetic Biology studies ethically acceptable?
7. Did you learn about iGEM?
8. Do you find the iGEM competition useful?
9. Are you going to follow the developments about iGEM and Synthetic Biology from now on?
10. Do you find our information leaflet about Synthetic Biology instructive?
