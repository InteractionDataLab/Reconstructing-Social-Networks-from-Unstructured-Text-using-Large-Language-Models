Normally, we designed an alternative sender-receiver quorum sensing device in order to combine it with the current quorum sensing devices in the Registry. Unfortunately, neither Las promoter system nor Lux promoter system, which is an experienced BioBrick cannot be assembled with reporter genes to test their efficiency.
The anchor-inducer or the anchor-reporter genes are designed with aim of regulating the detection module. In the case of transfection of TEV protease in the binding docks, these regulatory complexes are planned to be cleaved in order to release the inducer or the reporter.
The anchor-reporter device, BBa_K772006, is assembled with pTetR promoter correctly. Note that there was no RBS in the upstream region of the protein. Gel image can be seen below.
