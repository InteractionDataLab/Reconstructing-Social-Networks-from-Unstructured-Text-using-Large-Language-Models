(alias: Self-sacrificing)
Hi I have just finished second year of medical school. I've been addicted to iGEM since my first steps to university but only this year I have had a chance to be the part of this incredible team. After accidentally burning our precious bacteria while spreading the plate, mates got used to teasing me by calling ‘Bakteri Külbastı Ustası’ which in english means ‘Bacteria Cutlet Chef’. I’ve gained so much experience with iGEM, especially it woke up the spirit of endless research and explore in me. Besides I’m fanatical about astronomy and everything classic; books, music, clothes and etc.
