• The device must enhance the first finding signal by using common molecules:
We plan to amplify the CTC finding signal by attracting other bacteria and influencing them to synthesize signal molecules. To do this, we intend to use basic quorum sensing devices.  For this purpose, we aim to implement LuxR-AHL complex to engage cell to cell communication in order to convey “CTC is detected” message.
• Adaptable to the first module:
CTC recognition device in the first module is capable to link to the other devices. Therefore, we design the basic quorum sensing device as compatible with the first module. The quorum sensing device is planned to work only when the first module become active. The inducer for the quorum sensing device is linked to another molecule with TEV protease cleavage site. (In this case to GFP) Thus, when TEV protease becomes active, which means the first system is also actuated; our enrichment device will start to work, too.
• Being detectable easily:
As a result of quorum sensing, we aim to have a good signaling yield by synthesizing easy-to-identify compounds or mechanism such as fluorescent proteins, color change by LacZ or XylE enzymes etc.
•The system must be modular to allow alternative applications:
To amplify the signal, we intend to magnify the synthesis of signal molecules, but alternatively, we want to accumulate the amount of bacteria around the CTC by attracting them to the location of detection. Therefore, we aim to use simple chemotaxis to quorum sensing molecules to detect not only the presence of CTC in the media; but also, to localize it by indicating it with the bacteria cluster.
