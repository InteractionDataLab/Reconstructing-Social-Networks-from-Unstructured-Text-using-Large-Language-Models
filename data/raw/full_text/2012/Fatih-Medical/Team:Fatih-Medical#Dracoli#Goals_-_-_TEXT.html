• The necessity of a trigger device:
We plan to overcome this trouble by using chloride ion as an inducer for our promoter. The initiation of promoter will be triggered by light inducible ion channel called halorhodopsin. When we expose light to our bacteria, the halorhodopsin will begin to transfer chloride ions into the cell hopefully, therefore, our chloride dependent promoter system will be activated.
• The system must allow tuning:
Chloride ion gradient in the cell can be tuned by changing the emission of the light. With this capability, we hope to be able to regulate the downstream generator device by altering the light properties. (the power, exposure time etc.)
• Effective and controllable self-destruction device:
To prevent the production of GMOs, we need a strong destruction device whose synthesis is induced by the upstream promoter. In our project, we plan to use endolysin-holin complex or Limulus anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (LALF) to kill or to stop our modified bacteria.
