All the parts that are planned to be used would be engineered BioBrick because of the lack of adding new part in this section of our project. In spite of this, we were unable to assemble the current BioBricks in the Registry meaninglessly.
Halorhodopsin complete system was assembled with appropriate promoter into the upstream region and cloned. [See below] However, we confronted some problems with the synthesis of the chloride-sensing unit, Pgad.
Endolysin-holin complex is also assembled correctly and is cloned. The results can be seen below. There is a note we want to mention which shows that the endolysin part we use in our design (BBa_) was found incorrect during the confirmation electrophoresis afterwards PCR. Normally, this part has … bp length; but our results do not overlap with this. See imageyyyy (This experiment have been carried out repeatedly)
