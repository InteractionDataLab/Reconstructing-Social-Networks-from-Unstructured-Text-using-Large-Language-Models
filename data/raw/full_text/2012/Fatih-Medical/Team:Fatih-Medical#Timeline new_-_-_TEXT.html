Week 1
Friday
Today we started with a briefing from Mustafa where the main action points of the day were discussed. We had been planning the project of this year.We determined our parts that will be necessary:
K124014 holin
K559010 halorhodopsin+terminator(X2)
K112806 endolysine/T4
K112808 endolysine/holin/CMV/antiholin
These 4 parts was diluted and tagged. Then we coded these parts:
C1:J23100 cons-promoter
C2:CMV promoter
P1:CL promoter
H1:Holorodopsin
P2:IPTG
L1:endolsin
L2:holin
l3:eth+antiholin
We prepared 35 plates and 200 ml LB broth for next experiments.
Transformation (L1,L2,L3)
C1,C2 streak
Coloniese are incubated in liquid culture.(C1)
Saturday
Coloniese are incubated liquid culture.( 1,5 ml AMP ) for :
C1(x2),C2,N1,L2,L3.
We made this process 2 times because of high mistake risk for first times
Sunday
Single colony isolation has made for C1-x,C1-y,C2,L1,L2 and L3.
C1-x and C1-y are digested with EcoR1 and Pst1.
We prepared liquid culture for C2,L1,L3 again.Because there was not enough DNA for digestion.
Monday
Single colony isolation has been made for L1,L2 and L3.
Digestion has been made with EcoR1 and Pst1 for L1,L3 and C2.
electrophoresis was performed for C1-x,C2,L1,L2 and L3.
After electrophoresis,results of L1,L3 was true but the others was wrong.
Tuesday
Digestion has been made with Xba1 and Pst1 for L1 and L3.
34 mg/ml chloramphenicol included 49 tubes was prepared.
Chloramphenicol included 17 plates was prepared.
IPTG induceble promoter was coded as P2.
Transformation has been made for H1,L1P2 and L3P2
We prepared liquid culture for C1,C2,L2
Wednesday
Single colony isolation has been made for C1,C2,L2
We prepared liquid culture for C2 again.Because there was not enough DNA for digestion.
C1 and L2 are digested.
electrophoresis was performed for C1 and L2.
The result of C1 was true but the result of L2 was wrong so a new digestion will been performed and after that electrophoresis will been performed for new L2 and old L2.
We prepared liquid culture for P2L1,P2L3,C2,H1 and L2.
Thursday
We made isolation for P2L1,P2L3,H1,C2,L2 and then digestion has been made with EcoR1 and Pst1 for all of these parts.After that electrophoresis was performed for these parts.
The results of P2L1 and P2L3 might be true , we are not sure about this so we need some expert assistance and we need to sequence these part for being sure. Unfortunately the result of L2 was wrong again.
We prepared a new liquid culture for L2.
Week 2
'''Thursday'''  * We made isolation for P2L1,P2L3,H1,C2,L2 and then digestion has been made with EcoR1 and Pst1 for all of these parts.After that electrophoresis was performed for these parts. * The results of P2L1 and P2L3 might be true , we are not sure about this so we need some expert assistance and we need to sequence these part for being sure. Unfortunately the result of L2 was wrong again. * We prepared a new liquid culture for L2.
