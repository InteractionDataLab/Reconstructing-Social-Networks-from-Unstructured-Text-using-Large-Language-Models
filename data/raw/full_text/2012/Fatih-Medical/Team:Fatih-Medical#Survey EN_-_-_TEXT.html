SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
Synthetic Biology is basically the fusion of biology and engineering and can be defined as the design and construction of new biological entities such as enzymes, genetic circuits, and cells or the redesign of existing biological systems. The common goal is the design and construction of new biological functions and systems not found in nature. Therefore scientists who engage in synthetic biology research have two essential tools: The first tool is a living system which can be used as a so-called chassis. This biological system (e.g. microorganisms like bacteria, yeasts or even mammalian cells) will later accept the new synthesized DNA part which can simply be a gene from completely different organism. The second tool is BioBrick standard biological parts which are DNA sequences of defined structure and function and share a common interface and are designed to be composed and incorporated into living cells such as E. coli.
APPLICATION AREAS
Synthetic Biology includes the broad redefinition and expansion of biotechnology, with the ultimate goals of being able to design and build engineered biological systems that process information, manipulate chemicals, fabricate materials and structures, produce energy, provide food, and maintain and enhance human health and our environment.
SAFETY AND ETHICS
Synthetic Biology is an exciting multidisciplinary field that promises many benefits, whilst at the same time raising important social and ethical issues. The possibility that humans can create life, either from pre-existing organic parts or from inorganic materials – ‘’playing God’’  - has been the subject of considerable cultural worry. Opposition by civil society groups to Synthetic Biology has been led by the ETC Group who has called for a global moratorium on developments in the field and for no synthetic organisms to be released from the lab. In 2006, 38 civil society organizations authored an open letter opposing voluntary regulation of the field and in 2008 ETC Group released the first critical report on the societal impacts of synthetic biology which they dubbed "Extreme Genetic Engineering".
iGEM AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY
The International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, is a worldwide Synthetic Biology competition aimed at undergraduate university students. It is organised by the iGEM Foundation, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.
iGEM developed out of student projects conducted during MIT's Independent Activities Periods in 2003 and 2004. Later in 2004, a competition with five teams from various schools was held. In 2005, teams from outside the United States took part for the first time. Since then iGEM has continued to grow, with 130 teams entering in 2010.  Within the competition, student teams receive a kit of biological parts at the beginning of the summer from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build biological systems and operate them in living cells.
