Week 1 - June 1st-7th
Friday
Today we started with a briefing from Mustafa where the main action points of the day were discussed. We had been planning the project of this year.We determined our parts that will be necessary:
K124014 holin
K559010 halorhodopsin+terminator(X2)
K112806 endolysine/T4
K112808 endolysine/holin/CMV/antiholin
These 4 parts was diluted and tagged. Then we coded these parts:
C1:J23100 cons-promoter
C2:CMV promoter
P1:CL promoter
H1:Holorodopsin
P2:IPTG
