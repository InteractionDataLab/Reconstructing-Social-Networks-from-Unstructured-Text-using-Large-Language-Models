The first module aims to detect the possible circulating tumor cells (CTC) in the bloodstream. However, to be able to identify the presence of CTC through synthetic biology approach, we would need to amplify the signal with a second mechanism due to the prospective weak signal yield of the first module. Hence, we designed an enrichment system to solve this problem. LuxR/AHL duo is one of the main components of quorum sensing mechanism in bacteria. We plan to link this complex to the induction system by TEV protease which we intend to use in the first module. Therefore, the CTC detector bacterium becomes a “sender” to induce a chain reaction for signal amplification. The “message”, which features the knowledge of the detection of CTC, activates the “receiver” system in the rest of the bacteria in the media which ends up with a serial production of signaling molecules. (Here we want to use fluorescent proteins, LacZ and XylE.)
