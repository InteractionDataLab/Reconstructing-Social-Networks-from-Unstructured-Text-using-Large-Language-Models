Today Cancer is one of the most serious health problems and there is still no common effective cure for this disease. It is a group of diseases characterized by unregulated growth and spread of abnormal cells. If the spread is not controlled, it can result in death.
Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the US, exceeded by only heart disease. In 2012, about 577,190 Americans are expected to die of cancer, more than 1,500 people a day.  In most cases, cells derived from the primary tumor permeate through the bloodstream or lymphatic system and pose a greater death risk than the expansion of the original neoplasm. These cells are particularly called Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) and are essential for establishing metastasis.
Detection of CTCs in the blood in pre-metastatic phase of cancer offers a new opportunity for the early diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. Nowadays, there are only two major strategies for detection of Circulating Tumor Cells.  These are reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and immunomagnetic or other immunoseparation techniques [1]. However, these methods are costly and time consuming.
Our project is focused on CTC detection and the early diagnosis of cancer by the means of SynBio. We want to establish a CTC detection device in E.coli which will operate in a short period of time and reduce the expanses. As a result, our system could become a simple routine blood test for cancer diagnosis in the future.
EpCAM is a transmembrane protein, which is overexpressed on almost all CTCs. For our recognition system, we will use C215 Mouse Monoclonal Antibody which is very suitable for the EpCAM antigen[2]. We will install two protein complexes (TEVp N Terminal-OmpA-C215 and TEVp C Terminal-OmpA-C215) into the bacterial cell wall. As a result of the interaction between these two protein complexes, the split TEVp parts will fuse to form an active enzyme and trigger a signal pathway. [see details]
Regarding all of the difficulties which we may encounter, we decided to construct two different signaling pathways. It is based on the Fast Response module of Team Imperial College London 2010.
