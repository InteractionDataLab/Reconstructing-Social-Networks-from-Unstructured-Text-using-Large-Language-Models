Secret Book of Fatih Medical
After analyzing this year’s projects at iGEM, we thought of ‘’If only there were short and concrete abstracts of these studies’’ and decided to put it into practice and made the ‘’Secret Book of Fatih Medical’’. As a result of intensive work we prepared the pocket notebook with short project overviews of all participating teams at the Europe Jamboree 2012 which will hopefully help you to form ideas easily and rapidly about team projects and added sincere comments from our team.
What else to find in this notebook: Photos of beautiful places in Turkey as well as an empty page next to the team’s pages where you can take notes during this team’s presentation. We hope, this notebook will stay as a little souvenir from the 2012 iGEM Europe Jamboree. In addition, we wanted to decorate our Secret Book with various presents.
Everyone who gets one of our notebooks will at the same time get the chance to participate in our grand lottery! On the iGEM-Saturday, the excitement will be increasing about our BIG PRIZE which will remain secret till the big drawing at our project presentation. Hey! No reason to be sad if you weren’t the lucky one! During the poster presentations, many traditional Turkish presents will be ruffled off among all participants that will bring you in the oriental mood. We’re looking forward to see you all!!!
