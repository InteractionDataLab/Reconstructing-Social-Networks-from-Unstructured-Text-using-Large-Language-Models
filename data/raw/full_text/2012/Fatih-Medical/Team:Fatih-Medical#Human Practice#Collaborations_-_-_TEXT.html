Collaborations
Collaboration is one of the various benefits of iGEM; because, it is dependent to the contributions and teamwork to improve the science. Sailing for new horizons, harmony with the colleagues and collaboration are secret columns of the science society; so, when we were planning our project, collaborations were taken into account below our main missions. Our synthetic biology survey was translated into German and was shared with Freiburg and Frankfurt iGEM Teams. We reached more people via distributing our survey in the universities of Freiburg and Frankfurt. In exchange we presented their projects of this year in our presentation days and hope that it was helpful for young minds for understanding Synthetic Biology and iGEM studies better. We are thankful for their contribution and collaboration.
