Alex Power is a graduate student, and all around nice guy. I mean, just look at him. If that's not a friendly face, what is?
I'm a 4th year honours student in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Ottawa. Our team has put in a lot of hard work for this year's iGEM competition and we're excited to see the outcome. iGEM has been a fantastic experience and I would really encourage others to join and get involved!
I'm a 4th year honours student in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Ottawa. This year I focused on using Barry White music to optimize yeast mating efficiency and I can proudly say that I have achieved my goals. Can't wait for the jamborees!
I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering student at the University of Ottawa. I breath PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript every single day of the week. And I love it!
Hello. My name's John, and I'm currently a fifth year Honour's student at the University of Ottawa. I enjoy gaming (heavily), reading long articles on the beach and photoshopping cats on mars in my spare time.
I'm one of the wet lab members, and this fall I'm entering my third year of study towards my Honours B.Sc. with Specialization in Biochemistry. I'm one of the members privileged enough to be returning for my second year of competition in iGEM, and this year, I played a hand in the design and construction of the diploid cerevisiae strains seen in our 2012 project. I also took care of most of the A/V in our documentary. Science aside, I love to compose and play music, and be around awesome people. If you've actually made it this far in my bio, I encourage you to chat me up on twitter at @1MaginAZN!
I am a 4th year Biomedical Science student at the University of Ottawa.
This is my second year with iGEM and I had the rewarding opportunity to work in the laboratory this year. I was also involved with the Human Practices Team doing the narration for the documentary and I can't wait to see the final results when all the pieces come together, because it will be awesome!
Hi there, My name is Michael Xiang and this fall I will be starting my 3rd year at University of Ottawa studying Biochemistry and Computer Science. As part of this year's iGem team, I am in charge of the design section as well as the production of our documentary. "The Nature of Synthetic Biology" I hope you'll enjoy it and that it will insipire you all to become brilliant synthetic biologists =]
My name is Cory Lefebvre and I'm a second year student in the B.Sc. of Biochemistry program. This is my first year on the iGem team and can say that I haven’t regretted it for one second. I was part of the Design Team this year and helped with the design of the logo and the t-shirt. I hope to finish my degree in biochemistry and enter medical school to earn my M.D. degree.
Hi! My name is Caitlin Johnston and I'm a 3rd year Biochemistry student. As part of the iGEM team this year, I worked on planning and editing our documentary - The Nature of Synthetic Biology. I also enjoy biking and baking in my free time!
Hi, I'm Bahareh Manesh and my program is Biochemistry. I like track and field and I hope to get into neuroscience in the future.

I am currently in my 3rd year of Biochemistry. This is my first time as a member of the uOttawa iGEM team, working in the Human Practices. This has been a wonderful experience and I am looking forward to this year's turnout!
I am in the second year of my undergraduate in Biomedical Science and this is my first year involved in iGEM. I've mainly contributed to the human practices project.
Right now, I'm in my second year of Biomedical Sciences with an option in Med Chem. This is my first year with the iGEM team, helping out to design the website and t-shirts. Curious to see what my first of many jamborees will be like!
This fall, I'll be starting my 4rd year of an Honours BSc. in Biomedical Science with a Minor in Psychology. I'm incredibly excited to be a part of the uOttawa iGEM team as it amalgamates my love for biology and the real-world applications of science. With a few years of research experience under my belt and a past history as a competitive public speaker, iGEM and I are a great fit as it caters to my need to learn new things and to be heard! This year, I will be assisting the team by conducting interviews with various professionals for our Human Practices documentary!
Hi, I'm Elisabeth Hart McKittrick. I'm in my third year of an Honours BSc. in biology at the University of Ottawa. I'm interested primarily in animal physiology and behaviour, with a secondary interest in ecology and environmental issues. As a member of the Human Practices division of the uOttawa iGEM team, I contributed mainly to the development of this year's human practices documentary. When I'm not working with iGEM, I teach swimming, play volleyball, and make a mean chocolate zucchini bread.
Hi! I am a student at the University of Ottawa. I am currently pursuing a Biotechnology degree for my undergraduate studies which is double diploma in Chemical Engineering with a Biomedical Engineering option, and an Honours and Specialisation in Biochemistry. I have several research interests which include biological engineering with the objective of brain or nerve regeneration on the biochemistry and biotechnology side and refining petroleum or synthesizing a more efficient fuel on the chemical engineering side. Some of my hobbies include sports, reading and fashion.
Hey! My name is Warren, and I am currently in my third year at the University of Ottawa studying Biochemistry and Chemical Engineering. It is my first year on the uOttawa iGEM team, and I help out with designing the team website, t-shirts, poster, and presentation. Outside of nerding out six courses a term, I like to work up a sweat playing basketball and volleyball.
Student at uOttawa, 1st year Medicine.
Simon is the French guy in the team. He collaborates and collaborated with sponsors to help find sponsorship such as reagents to minimize the costs and to help the project move forward. He is also helping the team to find new ideas such as website design and look. He enjoys cycling hundreds of kilometers a week and he has a lot of laboratory experience already having begun doing research before entering university.
