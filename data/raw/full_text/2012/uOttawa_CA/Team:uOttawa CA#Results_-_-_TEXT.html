Characterization Data
The strains for characterizing the Tet repressor have been built. Characterization data of the Tet-BFP diploid strains (b) are shown below.
Promoter Design
To test our promoter design protocol, we decided to use the vector PRS416 and primers comprising the distal region of the GAL1 promoter with GAL4 binding sites replaced with tet operator sites. We submitted 9 plasmids for sequencing and our results below elucidate the sequence of our GAL-1 promoter within the PRS416 plasmid.
Of the 9 plasmids sequenced, 3 plasmids contained the desired sequence. Thus as a preliminary estimate, our efficiency is about 33%.
