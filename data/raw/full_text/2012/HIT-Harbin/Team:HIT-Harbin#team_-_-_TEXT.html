Team Overview
     The HIT-Harbin team is composed of 15 motivated students across a wide range of academic backgrounds this year: from freshman to senior, from biology to electromechanics. The identical dream makes us together to share the passion for science, stay-up late in the lab and learn. We're currently taking great efforts to make it and enjoying the happiness and sadness.
