ABOUT UNIVERSITY
HIT
Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) was founded in 1920, initially known as Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry. HIT sets a very high standard in education.  As a prestigious institution in China, HIT is known for its achievements in science and engineering areas for several decades. A 2009 analysis of research citations by Thomson Reuters Essential Science Indicators found HIT among the top 1% of institutions in the fields of Material Science, Chemistry, Engineering and Physics, and No.9 in the number of theses published in the area of Material Science worldwide. HIT has a high-level research faculty of over 2900 full-time teaching and research faculty, including 22 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Science and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. In recent years, the faculty and students have made great contribution to the development of the Chinese aerospace, especially the success of Shenzhou series spacecraft. In April 2004, the ''Experimental Satellite No.1'' was launched successfully, which was the first applicable small satellite developed by a Chinese university. Taking talent cultivation as a task, HIT will draw on its heritage of excellence and make full use of its comprehensive advantages to mold itself into world-class universities and contribute to the prosperity of the nation.
