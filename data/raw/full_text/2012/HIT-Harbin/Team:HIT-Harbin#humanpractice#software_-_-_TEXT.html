Introduction
    For the purpose of helping other iGEM teams to search some useful information about previous teams, we decide to develop an easy-use database software, which contains all common attributes of team information.
    This summer we spend a lot of time in settling data from the official homepage of iGEM. It is really a heavy task to collect all the teams' detailed information and parts list for the first year of iGEM. So, until now, the first version of this database does not include all, only teams of America area from 2008 and all their parts registered, which is absolute a huge work and would provide nearly all useful information about America's teams, including Canada and Latin America.

Query
    As for querying, we have provided many different SQL query codes in the compression bag. Showing in the video, it supports all the useful tuples you want to check. Certainly, you can develop your own SQL program for whatever you prefer to see, so long as complying with the rules of SQL grammar.
    In the next step, we'd like to develop an object-oriented program, which would be much easy for other people who have little knowledge of computer. The information you get may be limited within what we have considered, but we will provide the database as well. And besides the tuples of America, the next version will include Asian and European areas.
Version 2
    This simple software is designed for people who'd like to know the details of iGEM teams information and do not have enough idear of using SQL language. Unfortunately, we still have the data of America Area universities only, including north and south. This more visuable version, with easy way of connecting character, making big attribution to the spread of iGAME in not only Harbin Institute of Technology. We have uploaded it on the Internet. You can download the EXE file by yourself for free. Before run the software, make sure you have put the .xls file in the same place. We hope the next version with teams in all around the would came out soon.
