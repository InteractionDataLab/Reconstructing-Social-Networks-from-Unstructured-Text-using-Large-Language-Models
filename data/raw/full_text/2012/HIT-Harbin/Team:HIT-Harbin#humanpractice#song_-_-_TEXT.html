iGEM
The Song
    We don't only treat iGEM as a type of competition. It’s also a life style of us. As we know, the future belongs to children. So we wish to promote the iGEM to more people, especially children with a vivid thinking. In order to promote their interest in synbio, we rewrite the song “Talk to the animals”, changing their lyrics into something about the synbio. In order to promote their interest in synthetic biology, we edited the cartoon image according to the children song“Oh, bacteria”, and made a MV.
