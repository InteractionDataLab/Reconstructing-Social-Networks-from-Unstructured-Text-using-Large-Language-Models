Human Practice1
Invitation of a professor from Zhejiang University researching in synthesis biology.
A database software for everyone who’d like to collect the data of previous team information.
Create a flash showing the sprite of iGEM and the team of HIT.
Cartoon for spread of iGEM and synthesis biology around Harbin Institute of Technology.
In early June
Human Practice2
Song adaptation have done by Yifan WU, also made a flash linked to the Internet for sharing the iGEM happiness.
Made the first version of database software, which provides for SQL querying. But the database only includes teams from America.
In mid-July
Project selections
1. Memristor and some other electric devices by engineered bacteria.
2. Biofilm from cellulose degradation.
3. Microbial fuel cell from bacteria in industrial wastewater.
4. Environmental detection, Enterovirus.
On 05/18
Lecture
Speech given by Prof. CHEN from Zhejiang University
For introduce synthesis biology and iGEM latest hot research.
Two lectures in the Huanghe Road campus and the main campus.
After the lecture, we made recruitment of new members for iGEM_HIT.
In early March
Modeling Training
Prof. XU attending the meeting for biology modeling training.
Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a widely used approach for studying biochemical networks, in particular the genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions.
FBA is a powerful mean of biological metabolic networks.
The process of iGEM is design-modelling-experiment-design again.
Three methods:
System definition, Mass balance; Linear programming regulation
On 05/26
Human Practice2
Song adaptation have done by Yifan WU, also made a flash linked to the Internet for sharing the iGEM happiness.
Made the first version of database software, which provides for SQL querying. But the database only includes teams from America.
In mid-July
Modeling1
We searched plenty of publications for which related to mathematical modeling.
And two modeling members took responsible of each main part, detecting and killing, begin with figure out gene expression regulation.
For the next step, learning modeling software is necessary; we decided to use Matlab for main platform combining with other tools, such as cell designer.
In mid-July
Modeling2
Figure out the regulation of detecting device in mathematical method.
Peruse the related literatures to conclude the Ordinary Differential Equations for our novel design.
Simulation in matlab for getting the material curve and analyse the results.
In late July
Modeling3
Work out the regulation of killing device in mathematical method.
Conclude the Ordinary Differential Equations for our novel design from literatures.
Analyse the results from matlab curves of species variation.
Model improvement of the former part. Change the parameter of ODEs.
In early August
Column
Ying ZHANG concluded the software team of Berkeley in 2009, who build the platform for tools development of other researchers and teams.
Fangping XIE introduced the software team of USTC 2011. He elaborated the novel data structure which is named “Chain Node” model.
In June

In Mid-September
Logo Design
To design a logo which can show the spirit of our team. At last, ZHAO Kunming chose the windmill as the main part. One side, the blades can symbolize the biobricks, and these biobricks assemble a completed system which begins to ‘run’, the other side, the blades stand for the team which consisted of us coming from different majors that can make the work ‘run’.
In Mid-June
T-shirt Design
After drawing the comic, we discussed and chose the color of the T-shirts. Then we went to the cloths shop several times to make the T-shirts and got what we wanted at last. ZHAO Kunming contributes a lot in this work.
In September
