Preparation of Competent DH5-α cells
Materials:
LB Buffer
50 mL polypropylene tubes
TB Buffer
DMSO
DH5-α colonies or freshly thawed cells
TB Buffer (DH5-α competent cell buffer)
5mLs of 1M Hepes Buffer (final concentration 10 mM)
1.1 grams of CaCl2*2H2O (final concentration 15 mM)
9.32 grams KCL (final concentration 250 mM)
Bring to volume 300 mL; pH to 6.7 with 5 M KOH
Add 5.44 grams MnCl2*4H2O (final concentration 55 mM)
Bring volume to 500 mL and sterile filter into sterile bottle
Protocol
Start 5 mL overnight culture in LB from single DH5-α colony
Innoculate 200 mL of LB with 2 mL of overnight culture and grow at 25o C until OD = 0.5-0.55
(Alternatively, innoculate 200 mL LB with 50 uL freshly thawed DH5-α cells and grow at 25o C)
Note – if you do it this way, it may take a looooong time (more than 10 hours) to read OD = 0.5
Note from 11 August 2010: Using a single colony ON growth followed by inoculation of 200 mL with 2 mL of ON growth, it took 8.5 hours to reach OD = 0.5
Notes from 11 August 2011: Used 50 uL of freshly thawed cells to start 50 mL ON growth. Using 2 mL of ON growth to inoculate 200 mL, it took 8h and 45 minutes to reach OD = 0.503. Using 4 mL of ON growth, the OD > 0.55 after 7h 45min; a closer monitoring of the OD at this stage could shorten the prep by at least 1 hour
Transfer to 6 sterile, disposable ice-cold 50 mL polypropylene tubes (~35 mL per tube), Store on ice for 10 minutes
Harvest cells by centrifugation at 2500xg for 10 minutes at 4o C
Pour off medium and stand upside down on paper towel for 1 minute to remove remaining medium
Resuspend pellets by gently pipetting or swirling in 60 mL (total) of ice cold TB buffer
Combine resuspended cells into a total of two tubes
Centrifuge at 2500xg for 10 minutes at 4o C to recover cells
Pour of medium and stand upside down on a paper towel for 1 minute to remove remaining medium
Resuspend pellets by gently pipetting or swirling in 20 mL (total) of ice cold TB buffer. Combine cells into a single tube
Add 1.5 mL of DMSO and mix by swirling. Store cells on ice for 10 minutes
Pipette 250 and/or 100 uL aliquots into chilled Eppendorf tubes. Make sure to close tightly and then flash freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80o C
Test for (1) contamination by plating untransformed cells on Amp plate and (2) competence with a transformation
Preparation of Competent BL21 and Origami Cells
Thaw an aliquot of cells (without any plasmid in them) on ice
To 200 mL of sterile LB, add 50 uL aliquot of the thawed cells: remember, this LB does not have any antibiotic in it, so work as sterile as possible (i.e. autoclave all solutions and use sterile pipettes)
Grow cells in the shaker at 37o C until they reach an OD = 0.3-0.4 @600nm (1 cm pathlength cell). This usually takes 3-6 hours.
Aliquot into sterile 50 mL tubes and Spin down at 2700xg for 10 minutes at 4o C; discard supernatant and let drain upside down on a paper towel for ~1 minute.
Ice down sterile 100 mM CaCl2 and 100 mM MgCl2 solutions during centrifugation.
Gently resuspend each pellet in 8 mL 0.1 M MgCl2 and 2mL 0.1 M CaCl2 and combine into 2 tubes (this should take 1-2 minutes per tube)
Centrifuge 2700xg for 10 minutes and discard supernatant.
Resuspend each pellet on ice in 4 mL of ice cold CaCl2 and combine into one tube
Add 2.7 mL sterile 60% glycerol and mix gently
Aliquot 100 uL and/or 250 uL volumes into sterile (autoclaved), cold eppendorf tubes, freeze rapidly in liquid nitrogen and store at -80o C
Test for (1) contamination by plating untransformed cells on Amp plate and (2) competence with a transformation
CaS Deposition
Steps
Add an appropriate amount of DI water to create concentrations listed below to a 1000ml beaker
Heat the water to 90C stir at 200rpm <-seems fast
Add substrate
Wait 30min for substrate to stabilize <-seems long
Add the correct quantities to create the following concentrations:
0.033 M cadmium acetate
1 M ammonium acetate
28–30% ammonium hydroxide
0.067 M thiourea
Continue to add equal amounts of thiourea every five minutes
Continue for 50 minutes
Rate is 2nm/minute
Wash film with DI and dry in N2 environment

Preparation of Bacillus subtilis competent cell
Based on "Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus" (Harwood and Cutting, 1990)
Day 1
Streak out strains to be made competent on an LB or TBAB+G agar plate as a large patch and incubate overnight at 30o C
Day 2
The following morning, prepare SpC medium (as below under "Solutions") fresh on the day of use
Scrape the cell growth off the plate(s) and use to inoculate 20 mL of fresh, pre-warmed SpC medium to give an OD600 reading of ~0.5
Incubate the culture at 37o C with vigorous aeration and take periodic OD readings (OD600) to assess cell growth
While waiting for the rate of cell growth to depart from exponential (i.e. no significant change in cell density over 20-30 min), prepare SpII medium (as below under "Solutions") fresh
When exponential growth is no longer apparent, inoculate 200 mL of pre-warmed SpII medium with 2 mL of stationary-phase culture and continue incubation at 37o C with slower aeration
After 90 minutes of such incubation, pellet the cells by centrifugation (8,000 g, 5 min) at RT#Carefully decant the supernatant into a sterile container and save (***NOTE: using freshly prepared SpII will not work)
Gently resuspend the cell pellet in 18 mL of the saved supernatant and add 2 mL of sterile glycerol; mix gently
Aliquot the competent cells (~0.5mL) in sterile tubes, freeze rapidly in liquid nitrogen or a dry ice/ethanol or ice/isopropanol bath and store at -70o C
Solutions for competence induction in Bs

SpII + EGTA
Prepare SpII as usual, but substitute 4 mL EGTA (o.1 M, pH 8.0) for CaCl2. SpII + EGTA can be frozen at -20o C in small aliquots, although repeated freeze-thawing should be avoided
Transformation
Prepare SpII + EGTA or thaw a frozen aliquot
Thaw competent cells rapidly by immersing frozen tubes in a 37o C water bath
Immediately add one volume (200 mL) to thawed cells, and mix gently
In a sterile test tube, add competent cells (0.2~0.5 mL) to the DNA solution (<0.1 mL) and incubate in a roller drum at 37o C
Dilute the transformed cells as appropriate in T base containing 0.5% glucose and plate immediately onto selective media
