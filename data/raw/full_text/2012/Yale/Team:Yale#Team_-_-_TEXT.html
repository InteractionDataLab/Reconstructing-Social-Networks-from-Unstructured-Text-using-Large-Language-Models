Where we work
This year, the team relocated from the laboratory of emeritus Professor Nigel Grindley to a vacant lab on Yale Unviersity's recently acquired West Campus, located in the town of Milford, twenty minutes away by shuttle from central campus. Equipped with donations from the retiring professors Grindley and Roeder, the lab housed our research throughout the summer and now as we continue into the Fall term.
