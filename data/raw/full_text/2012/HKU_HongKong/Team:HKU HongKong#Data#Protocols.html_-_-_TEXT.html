Molecular Cloning Protocols
Transforming Competent E.coli with the    Plasmid:
We chose the biobrick K137076 to  ligate to the pvdQ gene for the following reasons:
Take out the competent E-coli   cells from the -80 freezer. (Keep all tubes on ice).  
Add 1uL   of the plasmid DNA in 100uL competent cells (if from Kit). For   transformation of ligated product, add 10uL of the ligated plasmid DNA in   100uL competent
cells.
Incubate on ice for 10 min.
Place   in water bath at 42°C for 90s.
Place   immediately back on ice for at least 2 min.
Add   800uL LB broth. Incubate for 1hr   at 37°C shaker.
Centrifuge at 130rpm for 5min   to remove supernatant. Re-suspend the pellet in about 10uL of supernatant.
Spread the entire re-suspended   pellet on ampicillin agar dishes.
Incubate for 12-16 hours at 37 °C.
 
Notes:
Colonies grown on plate were selected for colony PCR screening.
Correct colonies were then cultured in 5 mL LB Broth with 0.5uL     ampicillin for subsequent screening or mass culturing.
Mass culturing involved adding 200uL of the culture into 35mL LB     Broth with 35uL ampicillin.
 
Miniprep to    Extract the Plasmid from E.coli (QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit):
 
Transfer some of the 5mL bacterial culture into a microcentrifuge     tube. Pellet by centrifugation at 13,500 rpm for 1 min. Repeat till     all the culture has been pelleted.
Resuspend the pellet in 250uL Buffer P1.
Add 250uL Buffer P2 (Lysis Buffer). Mix thoroughly by inverting the     tube 4-6 times. Do not allow prolonged lysis.
Immediately add 350uL Buffer N3 (Neutralization Buffer). Mix     immediately by inverting the tube.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 13,500 rpm.
Apply the resulting supernatant to the QIAprep spin column by     pipetting. Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,500 rpm.
Wash the QIAprep spin column by applying 0.75mL Buffer PE.     Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,500 rpm.
Centrifuge for an additional 1 minute to remove residual ethanol.
Place the QIAprep spin column in microcentrifuge tube. Elute DNA by     adding 50uL warm H2O.
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 13,500 rpm.
