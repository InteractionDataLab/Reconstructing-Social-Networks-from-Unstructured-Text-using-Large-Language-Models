  The city of Hong Kong is known as the world’s commercial hub.  Logically, a large sum of money is invested in expansion of multinational  enterprises, to gain a cutting edge financially and economically. In a country  so focused on development and international recognition, the field of Synthetic  Biology has not been given much attention. 
  In an attempt to raise awareness of this upcoming field, University  of Hong Kong’s iGEM team made three preliminary initiatives. We wanted to begin  by educating the youth about this concept. Hence, we published an article in  HKU’s Undergraduate Magazine, a magazine that is widely distributed amongst  students at HKU. Our next move was to produce a video that further explained  the concept. This video was extensively broadcasted throughout all televisions  on HKU’s Main Campus. Lastly, we attempted a very novel strategy to publicize  this field of Science. This innovative approach is called the “Flash Mob”. In  one of the very crowded markets of Hong Kong, our group members took stage  (without prior notice), and performed a short Drama to explain the workings of Synthetic  Biology and advertise iGEM amidst the common public. All three approaches of  reaching out to Hong Kong’s citizens about Synthetic Biology were quite  effective. 
  Through our Human Practice projects, the concept of Synthetic  Biology – a subject area concerning biological research and technology - was  effectively delivered. In the coming years, this research area can be used to  create new biological systems that will benefit society. It promises to  decrease problems we are currently facing by implementing strategies for the degradation  of pollutants, electricity generation, and medical treatments.  </P><P align="left"> </P><P align="left">A. Publishing in HKU Undergraduate Magazine</P><P align="left">To establish a stronger presence in  HKU, our IGEM team published an article in HKU’s Undergraduate Magazine. This  magazine is freely distributed to all HKU undergraduate students. It can also  be found at various locations around campus, such as the Canteens, Main  Library, and the main Podium. Thereby, it is widely accessible, increasing the  odds that students’ read our article. 
The article covered all the important  aspects of Synthetic Biology, including what Synthetic Biology is as well as  its current workings and future implications.   We illustrated a variety of applications of the field, especially those  in biomedicine, energy conservation, and agriculture. Also, we utilized Lego  blocks to explain the concept of biobricks, which are put together to create  new living systems.  The article was also  a means to advertise the iGEM team and competition to HKU’s students. In order  to do so, we briefly explained all our past projects, and the application  process to be part of HKU’s team in the coming years. Through this, we hope to recruit  skillful and motivated members for next year’s team. </P><P align="left"> </P><P align="left">B. Video Broadcasting in Campus TV,  HKU</P><P align="left">
  Animations and video broadcasting are one of the most effective ways of  approaching the undergraduates at HKU. The main campus has over 10 televisions  for video broadcasting. Thus, through the Campus TV department of HKUSU, we were  able to include our short video covering Synthetic Biology and the iGEM  competition into the University’s daily broadcasting schedule. </P><P align="left">Since audiences of differing fields of  study view the TVs, we made sure that everyone, regardless of their background  in Synthetic Biology, could understand the concept. For instance, Lego  block-animations were used to illustrate the procedure of the construction of a  genetic network or bio-brick production. Moreover, we also aimed to introduce  the applications of Synthetic biology that extend beyond medicine generation as  well as production and supply of genetically modified food to the third world.
In an attempt to stimulate motivated  undergraduates to begin thinking of joining HKU’s iGEM team, we also introduced  the workings of the team as well as our previous and current representatives.  We hope that this would bring forth some of the most capable undergraduates  from various fields of study for next year’s recruitment. </P><P align="left"> </P><P align="left">C. Smart Mob (Street Drama)</P><P align="left"> 
  To promote Synthetic Biology, our iGEM Team reached out to the main crowd of  Hong Kong. The city, long known as a “shopping paradise”, has extensive streets  showcasing a plethora of local and international commodities. These markets,  especially on weekends, are heavily populated with all types of people, the  elderly, middle-aged, and the youth. Hence, there wasn’t a better way of  reaching out to the general public about Synthetic Biology than unexpectedly  performing a short Drama openly in Hong Kong’s shopping district known as Mong  Kok.  This street drama performance, with  no prior notice, can be effectively termed as the “Smart Mob”. 
  We managed to execute two performances, on the 26th of August and 15th  of September respectively. The main cartoon character of our cast was Synthia,  a green bacterium much liked by the common public.  Many people stopped by and requested for a  photograph with this bacterium, a partially incomplete synthetic organism that escapes  from Dr. Venter’s laboratory and is unfortunately adrift in the crowded streets  of Hong Kong. Hence this marks the beginning of our drama’s storyline. 
The other two characters in our drama are the Moralist and Dr. Venter. While  the Moralist tries to kill Synthia and accuses scientists like Dr. Venter of jeopardizing  public safety, Dr. Venter makes every attempt to try and defend his laboratory  investigations and practices. Thus these two personas spark into a heated  debate. With the introduction of our last character, Dr. Venter’s laboratory  helper, and much interaction with the common public, we were able to resolve  this debate and accurately illustrate the definition and purpose of synthetic  biology. We are confident that through this innovative approach, which harbored  some light-hearted comedy, our audience has acquired a glimpse into the dilemma  that Science and technology are facing today, despite of which these fields  have advanced to publish data that is beneficial for society. </P><P> </P><P> </P><DIV id="footer" style="width: 1075px; height: 206px"><P> </P><P> </P><P style="text-align: left"><FONT color="#0E9A40" face="Segoe UI Semibold"><B><SPAN style="font-size: 14pt">Our kind Sponsors:</SPAN></B></FONT></P><P style="text-align: left">     </P></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
