Bio-bricks:
 
1) Constitutive Promoter (J23119) + Ribosomal  Binding Site (B0034) + pvdQ Gene + Double Terminator (B0015)
 
This biobrick was constructed to test the  expression of the pvdQ gene amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of Pseudomonas  aeruginosa. It is an uncontrollable, standard biobrick that can later be used as  a baseline reference to test whether our future biobricks result in an  improvement in pvdQ expression level.  The biobrick is a composite part  consisting of the already prevalent Constitutive Promoter [2006 Berkley], along  with the newly inserted pvdQ gene. It is also composed of a strong RBS and a  transcription double terminator. 
Constitutive Promoter (J23119): This promoter biobrick is the consensus sequence and therefore results in the  idealized transcription scenario. Since it is a strong promoter and is  constitutively expressed, it complies with our preliminary goal of testing  transcription and translation of the pvdQ gene in an AHL-independent manner
2) LacI Promoter, RBS, LuxR Gene,  Double Terminator, LuxR Promoter, & RBS (K137076) + pvdQ Gene + Double  Terminator (B0015)
This biobrick was constructed to test the expression of the pvdQ gene in an environment containing the 3OC12-HSL  substrate. However, the synthesis of pvdQ is not exclusively dependent on AHL.  This is because the LacI+pI promoter that initiates transcription of the LuxR  gene can be effectively induced by IPTG. Moreover, the LuxR promoter is also  expressed well in the absence of LuxR and AHL. The biobrick is composed part of  the already existing K137076 [2008 Caltech] as well as the pvdQ gene and double  terminator sequence. The first 1,096bp of the K237076 biobrick containing the  LacI and LuxR promoters, two RBS, and the LuxR gene was amplified using the  standard Prefix primer and a newly designed Suffix primer.
We chose the biobrick K137076 to  ligate to the pvdQ gene for the following reasons:
 K137076   consists of a strong, continually expressed promoter (R0011) that can,   however, be further induced by IPTG. Such a promoter allows us to control   the expression of the LuxR protein.  
 
The complex formed when two   molecules of LuxR bind to two molecules of AHL, attaches to a palindromic   site on the pLuxR to transcribe the pvdQ gene.This pLuxR promoter however   causes leaky expression of pvdQ as it can be induced even in the absence of   LuxR and AHL.
 
 
3). Constitutive Promoter (pLacI) + Ribosomal Binding Site + LuxR Gene + Double Terminator + LuxR Promoter  (J09855) + Ribosomal Binding Site (B0034) + pvdQ Gene + Double Terminator  (B0015)
This biobrick was constructed such  that
 
4). LuxR Promoter (R1062) + Ribosomal  Binding Site, LuxR Gene, Double Terminator, & Ribosomal Binding Site (amplified  from K137076) + pvdQ Gene + Double Terminator (B0015)
This final biobrick is entirely an AHL-dependent system, as an identical  promoter controls the transcription and translation of both the LuxR and the  pvdQ gene. This LuxR promoter, unlike its Bba_R0062 counterpart, is only weakly  expressed in the absence of LuxR and AHL. However, a desirable positive feedback  mechanism is generated upon coupling of AHL with the LuxR protein.  The AHL-LuxR  complex binds to pLuxR and upregulates gene expression. As more LuxR  is expressed, subsequent pairing of the molecules further activates the  promoter. Thereby, a large yield of pvdQ is obtainable at low cell density. The  outcome is advantageous as biofilm formation can be interrupted at an early  stage.
