Abstract
 
HKU’s iGEM team aims to introduce    an acyl homoerine lactone (AHL)-degrading genetic system into the non-biolfilm-forming    and non-virulent BL21 Escherichia coli strain. PvdQ, an enzyme naturally    produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is an acylase that functions to    degrade long chain AHLs that bacteria like Pseudomonas putida or    aeruginosa itself utilize for biofilm formation. Biofilms are population    density-dependent structures formed by quorum sensing bacteria that    produce and secrete auto-inducers, which signal selective gene    transcription. These signaling molecules, namely the AHLs, are    responsible for most bacterial pathogenicity including the opportunistic    respiratory infections caused by P.aeuroginosa in immunocompromised    patients.
As a step towards combating these infections, E.coli can be effectively    used as a protein factory to maximize pvdQ yield in vitro or ex vivo.    Our most preliminary biobrick is a constitutive promoter that drives    baseline, exponential expression of pvdQ. This genetic pathway is    advantageous because the pvdQ gene is constitutively transcribed    regardless of environmental and endogenous factors. 
 This synthetic genetic pathway is an auto-inductive system where pvdQ    protein production will specifically depend on the presence of N-dodecanoyl-L-Homoserine    lactone and its coupling to the LuxR protein. Furthermore, several    derivatives of the genetic system design can desirably optimize pvdQ    yield. For instance, implementation of a positive feedback loop will    upregulate luxR production by the simple placement of the luxR gene    downstream of PluxR Larger amounts of luxR will therefore bind a greater    number of AHL molecules secreted by P.aeuroginosa biofilms, thereby    activating the acylase gene’s expression at a low cell density. Hence,    the final biobrick produced by iGEM HKU is an AHL-inducible acylase    system.
 Although the synthetic E.coli cannot be introduced into infected humans    or soil and water (sources of P.aueroginosa) itself, it can be used to    mass-produce pvdQ which can then be packaged into small protein-delivery    bores. These structures can be stimulated to efficiently release pvdQ at    the desired location, mimicking conventional drug-delivery systems.    While the mechanism of pvdQ delivery will not be addressed, it can be    regarded as a potential implication of HKU’s iGEM project.
