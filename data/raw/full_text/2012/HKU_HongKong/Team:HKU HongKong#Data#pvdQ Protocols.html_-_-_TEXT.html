IPTG Induction
[PCR or Restriction Digestion Test must be performed to check for  transformation of correct plasmid].
Pick a colony and inoculate it into 5 mL broth with ampicillin.            Incubate for 8 hours.
Use 1mL of the culture in 10mL of broth with ampicillin (1:10        ratio). Grow the culture in warm room shaker till the OD reaches        0.6 (-0.8). Usually take around 3-6 hours.
Add appropriate amount of IPTG (0.4-1.0 mM to the final          concentration).
Incubate at 37°C in shaker for 3-4 hours.
Centrifuge and remove the supernatant (note the volume).
Store the pellet in -20°C freezer until sonication.
Osmotic Shock to Obtain Periplasmic Fraction:
Resuspend the pellet in 0.5mL PBS (phosphate buffered saline) or              wash pellet twice in 30mM NaCl.
[1L 1XPBS: 800mL Distilled Water, 8g NaCl, 0.2g KCl, 1.44g              Na2HPO4-2H2O, 0.24g KH2PO4, adjust pH to 7.4 with HCl, Distilled              water to a total of 1L. Isotonic and nontoxic to cells, so can be              sued to dilute substances, wash reagent.]
Centrifuge for 10min at 4°C (4863g). Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in 2.5mL ice-cold sucrose buffer.
[Sucrose Buffer: 30mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 1mM EDTA, and an equal              volume of 0.5M sucrose.]
Incubate for 10 minutes on ice while shaking vigorously.
Centrifuge for 10min at 4°C (4863g). Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in 0.25 mL ice-cold 0.5mM MgCl2. Add              appropriate amount of proteinase inhibitor.
Incubate on ice for 10 minutes.
Centrifuge for 20 minutes at 10,000g.
[Supernatant contains the periplasmic proteins. The pellet, which    contains the rest of the cell components after the periplasmic    components have been released into the supernatant, can be processed as    the preparation of whole cell extracts. Then, the supernatant collected    will contain the non-periplasmic cellular proteins.]
Sonication
Add a volume equal to the volume of discarded supernatant of PBS to              the pellet. Resuspend well.
Add the proteinase cocktail mix (the volume added depends on its              concentration and the volume of PBS).
Place the micro centrifuge on ice. Elevate it to an appropriate              height so as to properly submerge the sonicator's rod into the              sample.
Set the pulse (4 second), rest time (7 seconds), time (2 minutes),              and amplitude (20%) to appropriate values. Place the sample on ice              and elevate to an appropriate height.
Turn on the sonicator and sonicate till the sample is clear              (continually check the opacity at 45 second intervals).  
Centrifuge at 13,200 rpm for 10 min. Remove save the supernatant and              the pellet.
Resuspend the pellet in equal volume of PBS (as the volume of the              supernatant).
Store in -20 degrees freezer until the samples are ready to use for              SDS-PAGE/Western Blot.
SDS-PAGE
Prepare 12% Seperating Gel corresponding to a 78kDa protein.
Fill ¾ of the gel cassette with the Seperating Gel. Allow it to              completely polymerize.
Fill the rest of the cassette with the Stacking Gel. Let it              polymerize for about one hour.
Add 3X Protein loading buffer to 20uL of the protein samples. 5% (of              the total volume of the dye) Mercaptoethanol should be added              freshly. Mix, boil at 100 degrees for at least 5 min.
Place the gel in the electrode assembly. Place the assembly into the              tank.
Fill with 1X Gel Tank buffer. Make sure interior of electrode              assembly has equal or more buffer as outside.
Attach to the power supply. Run at 110 V until the loading buffer              reaches the bottom edge of the separating gel.
Upon completion, disassemble by removing the gel from between the            glass plates.
Western Blotting
Perform the              transfer
Incubate the membrane with non-fat milk at room temperature for 30 minutes.              This is the blocking step that prevents non-specific antibody              binding.
Place membrane in the primary antibody. Incubate at 16 degrees on              roller overnight.
Wash the membrane with Tris Buffer Saline and Tween20 (TBST) three              times at 10-minute intervals. Place on shaker during the wash step.
Incubate with secondary antibody on roller for one hour.
Wash the membrane with TBST three times at 10 minute intervals.
Place the membrane in an X-ray cover. Add the substrate, and              immediately develop the X-ray film in a dark room.
Notes:
- Samples included IPTG    induced and no IPTG samples for BL21 colonies with and without the    recombinant plasmid. The BL21 without the plasmid serves as a control of    the proteins already present within the bacterial strain. Also, for each    sample, both 20uL of the pellet resuspended in PBS (containing insoluble    proteins) and the supernatant (with soluble proteins and the expected    pvdQ) were loaded in separate wells during electrophoresis. 
- Since the pvdQ protein contains a His Tag sequence at its C-terminal,    the primary antibody used is Anti-His antibody derived from rabbits. The secondary antibody used is Anti-rabbit antibody derived from goat.
Croomassie Blue Staining
Place the gel in a container and cover it with croomassie blue dye.
Place in shaker for 20 min.
Destain using                  ethanol/acetic acid/water solution. Destain at least 3 times in 10              min intervals on the shaker.
Visualize the                  gel
His Tag Protein Purification
Prepare a 200mL stock of 1X Charge Buffer, 1X Binding Buffer, 1X              Wash Buffer, and 1X Elution Buffer.
Column                  Preparation:
        - Add a few mL of ste1ile, ddH20 to                  the dry column. Gently apply pressure to the top of the column to                  allow the column flow to commence.
        - Mix the resin well and add 1 mL of                  the resin into the column. Allow it to settle.
        - Wash the column with 3 volumes of                  ddH20.
        - Wash the column with 5 volumes of                  1X Charge Buffer.
        - Wash the column with 3 volumes of              1X Binding Buffer.
Column                  chromatography:
        - Allow 1X Binding buffer to reach                  right at the surface of the column bed.
        - Load the column with the prepared                  protein extract.
        - Re-load the flow through to make                  sure all the HisTag protein binds to the resin.
        - Wash the column with 10 volumes of                  1X Binding Buffer. This step can be repeated using the flow through.
        - Wash the column with 6 volumes of                  1X Wash Buffer.
        - Elute the bound protein with 6                  volumes of 1X Elution Buffer.
