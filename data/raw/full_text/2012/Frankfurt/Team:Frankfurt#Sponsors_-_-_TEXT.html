We firstly want to express our gratitude to our instructor Prof. Boles, to the dean of studies Prof. Soppa, to Prof. Fendler from the Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysics and to Prof. Manfred Schubert-Zilovics (University Vice President) for enabling the project by providing monetary and laboratory resources. We also want to thank Prof. Bettina Tudzynski for providing DNA from Gibberella fujikuroi. We thank Christina Wagner from the presidium for the inestimable help with the administration of our finances.
We also thank all those who were involved into our teams work in the very beginning and had to finish there dedication for different reasons. Our project and our team would have never get so far without the help and the work from those persons.
We are deeply grateful for the financial support from the Goethe University and the Max Planck Institute for Biophysics.
