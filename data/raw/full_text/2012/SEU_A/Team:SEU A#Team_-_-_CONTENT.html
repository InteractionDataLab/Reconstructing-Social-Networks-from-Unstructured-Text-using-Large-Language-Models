It is also one of the universities of Project 211 and Program 985 that is financed by the central government to build as a world-class university.    Southeast University is one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in China. its origin can be traced back to 1902, when it was founded as Sanjiang Normal College. Then, it evolved as: Nanjing Higher Normal School, National Southeast University and National Central University. During the nationwide restructuring of institutions of higher learning in 1952, Nanjing Institute of Technology was established on the original site of National Central University. In May 1988, the university was renamed Southeast University. And in April 2000, Nanjing Railway Medical College, Nanjing College of Communications and Nanjing Geological School were merged into the university, whose main campus is located at the center of the ancient capital city of Nanjing, a sacred place for education since the Ming Dynasty. At present, Southeast University has campuses such as Sipailou ,Jiulonghu and Dingjiaqiao, covering a total area of 427 hectares.   Now, Southeast University has become a comprehensive university of high reputation comprised of various Schools&amp;departments of science, engineering, art, social sciences, law, economics, management, languages, etc., with engineering as its focus. The university boasts over 34 schools or departments with 64undergraduate disciplines in all. It also has 20 post-doctoral stations, and offers 95 PhD programs and 208 Master programs; it holds a national lead in architecture, civil engineering, electronics, information technology, energy, power engineering, and transportation technology. The total number of faculty and staff is 6000, including 1300 full or associate professors, 450 doctoral supervisors, 9 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Academy of Engineering, 28 &quot; Cheung Kong Scholar&quot; Professors. At present, the full-time students number over 27000, of whom about 10000 are postgraduates.    Southeast University encourages the school spirit of &quot;rigor, truthfulness, unity and diligence&quot;, i.e., adopting the rigorous, truthful, realistic scientific attitude and working spirit of full cooperation. It has turned out more than 200000 excellent personnel, among whom there are 153 academicians. With the quality education strengthened, its graduates not only have excellent theoretical competence and practical skills, but also possess a wide range of knowledge and abilities. Its average undergraduate employment rate goes beyond 99% upon graduation.    Southeast University is one of the top 10 universities in scientific research and development in China. It has over 20 national or provincial research institutes, with a number of key research bases. It’s research fund exceeded RMB 646 million in 2007. the SEU Architecture Design and Research Institute, which is one of the few national first-class design institutes, have undertaken various major projects. SEU’s affiliated Zhongda Hospital, which was set up in 1935, is one of the first hospitals in Jiangsu Province that were assessed as &quot;Class A Grade 3&quot; hospitals by the State Ministry of Public Health.

       				 National Laboratory of Molecular and Biomolecular Electronics, which is subordinate to the Educational Department of China, is situated at Southeast University(SEU), in the center of the ancient city of Nanjing, JiangSu Province, China, with convenient transportation and communication.   In 1983, the Laboratory of Molecular and Biomolecular Electronics was proposed by Prof.Yu Wei, a distinguished female electronic engineering scientist,who was the president of SEU and now the vice-master of the Educational Affairs Department. Two years later, the laboratory became a reality. At the end of 1992, it was opened to the public with approval of the State Educational Commission. In June of 1992,the laboratory was given the name of Chien-Shiung Wu Laboratory in recognition of the world famous physist Dr.Chien-Shiung Wu. In Aug. 1999,it was appointed to the key laboratory by Ministry of Education.   The long-term direction of researches focuses on molecular electronics, a rapidly developing interdisciplinary subject in the world with a long-term goal of studying and designing a new generation of electronic devices: molecular electronic devices and bionic information processing systems. The main research areas include nanometer functional molecular material and its assembly technology, energy and information transfer at the molecular level, molecular optical switches and storage systems, molecular and biomolecular sensors, molecular design, principles and systems of molecular computing.The laboratory possess an excellent research team composed of young researchers holding higher academic degrees with different scientific expertise in electronics,chemestry,biochemestry,physics and computer science.
