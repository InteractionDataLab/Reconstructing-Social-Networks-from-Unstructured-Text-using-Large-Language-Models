Ideas
On the journey of preparing the game, what we have achieved is splendid while the scene is also fascinating. It was not necessarily all about the humdrum experiment, during which we experienced much fresh content diversely regarding to our various living course, for example, the new game designed by us. It was an unintentional spark coming out from our daily laboratory life: when the experiment was running, there was a large probability of waiting for more than 2 hours, then, we would get together to discuss to do something magic. Here comes the game - Bio-magic!
Game Description
   Our game is a turn-based card game. The most essential rule is that if the text on a card contradicts a game rule, the card text takes precedence. Below are the basic game rules:
1. At the beginning of the game, each player randomly gets an identity card. Then each player roll dice to decide which one is the first to begin. The sequence of actions is counterclockwise. 2. At the beginning of the game, each player has three cards. 3. At the beginning of the game, each player has 10 points. Anyone who gets 0 or less points loses the game.
4. Each player’s turn has four parts: beginning phase, promoter-placing phase, generator-placing phase, inducement-placing phase. 5. In the beginning phase, each player draws two cards. 6. In the promoter-placing phase, each player rolls dice to decide the location of the promoter. You can only place one promoter in one phase.
7. In the promoter-placing phase, you can also place the Advance. If so, skip your generator-placing phase of this round. 8. In the generator-placing phase, you can pass the generator to another player A, and the one just on the right or the left of player A can choose to place a terminator to stop it. 9. The terminator has different efficiency with different quantity. If there is only one terminator following the promoter, you must roll dice to get a point greater than 3 to place the generator; otherwise, you take the generator back into hand. 10. In the inducement-placing phase, you can place inducement in front of the corresponding promoter to produce its domain protein. 11. Different proteins have different functions, as a consequence, you can use them to gain points or reduce the opponent’s points. 12. When the deck is empty, each player’s points will be accounted, and the highest one together with his company wins the game.
