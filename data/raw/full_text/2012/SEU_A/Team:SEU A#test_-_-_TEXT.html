It uses a light version of jQuery mobile, navigate the slides by swiping with your fingers
It's completely free (even if a donation is appreciated)
Camera slideshow provides many options to customize your project as more as possible
It supports captions, HTML elements and videos and it's validated in HTML5
Different color skins and layouts available, fullscreen ready too
