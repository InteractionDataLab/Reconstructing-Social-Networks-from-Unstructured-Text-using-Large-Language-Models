iGEM 2012 SEU_A Human Practice
Campus Perception
Synthetic biology is just like the ancient Egyptian pyramids, full of mysteries and excitement, and igem is much like… Let’s start out here, enjoy the journey, keep the curiosity and share it with more people.    For most college students except those who major in biology, synthetic biology is really obscure. Many even have no idea what it stands for.    Synthetic biology is an emerging cross-discipline subject based on molecular biology, cell biology, systems biology, bioinformatics, genetic engineering and other disciplines, which has made huge progress in the ten years since birth.    In the university, we explained synthetic biology to students from various majors and faculties. They are active, curious and enthusiastic with great practical ability.    With the development of relevant technologies, such as genetic engineering technology, microbiological engineering technology, computer technology and synthetic genomics technology, we believe firmly that synthetic biology will achieve more and play a more important role in solving problems like energy, environment, medical treatment and medicine production.    We aim at broadening their ways of thinking by combining synthetic biology with other subjects. They listened to the lecture attentively, put forward their own thoughts, provided us with new ideas and helped sharpen our proposal.
