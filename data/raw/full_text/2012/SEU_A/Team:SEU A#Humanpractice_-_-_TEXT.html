Activities
Enjoy a world of Synthetic Biology
Overview
Synthetic biology is a new area of biological research and technology that combines science and engineering. It encompasses a variety of different approaches, methodologies, and disciplines with a variety of definitions. The common goal is the design and construction of new biological functions and systems not found in nature.    Actually, people often fail to adopt new ideas timely and tend to dodge the revolutions of new ideas. The hesitation results from lack of relevant knowledge and thus lack of control of unknown areas. We are committed to spread relevant knowledge, communicate with people and motivate innovation.
Summary
Through six months’ concerted effort, finally we have got some result and we are satisfied with it. On September 20th, we were honored to invite the members of igem teams in Nanjing University to share their fruit with us.
