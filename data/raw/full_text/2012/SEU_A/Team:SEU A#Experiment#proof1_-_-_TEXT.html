HSP
The confirmation experiment of HSP promoter
The confirmation experiment of HSP promoter
We use K873012(HSP promoter + E0240) which we construct by combining k873002 and E0240 to test the function of HSP promoter . The functions we expect from this kit are as follows:  at normal temperature（e.g. 37℃）, the E. Coli do not express the protein; when the temperature rises to a certain degree (such as 42 ℃), the transcription will be activated, expressing green fluorescent protein.
Experimental procedure: Step 1:  recover K873012,and shake it in 37℃ for 12 to16h at150rpm. Step 2: use 50ul bacterial liquid which has been diluted   times to coat sagar Luria-Bertani medium. Set temperature and induced factor (IPTG, 1 mM) control.
