Prepped plasmids and made frozen stocks for IGM004 (pSB3K3-I714891) (GFP), IGM005 (pSB1AK3-K081014) (RFP), and IGM006 (pSB1A2-K081009) (LasI)
Prepared 5 uM stocks of BioBricks sequencing primers
Submitted IGM004 (pSB3K3-I714891), IGM005 (pSB1AK3-K081014), and IGM006 (pSB1A2-K081009) for sequencing
Transformed IGM021 (pSB1A2-J06504) (RFP) into TOP10 E.C. cells; plated on LB+Cab and picked colonies for cultures; made frozen stocks; prepped and submitted for sequencing
