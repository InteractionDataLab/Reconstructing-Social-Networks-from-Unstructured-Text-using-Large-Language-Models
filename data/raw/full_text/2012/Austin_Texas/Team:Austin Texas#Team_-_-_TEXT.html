Attributions
Advisors
Prof. Jeff Barrick - faculty sponsor. A little graphic design for the website and coordinated getting Pseudomonas strain for Caffeinated coli. Found numbers to do calculation of number of guanines in E. coli.
Jared Ellefson - Main ZombiE.coli project advisor.
Michael Hammerling - Main Spinach-mCherry dual reporter project advisor. Advised students on lab work for ZombiE.coli and Caffeinated coli.
Erik Quandt - Main caffeinated coli project advisor.
Team
Razan Alnahhas -Constructed and tested pConverter.
Logan Bachman - Constructed and tested Spinach and Spinach-mCherry reporters.
Will Darden - Performed simulations of ZombiE.coli. Analysis of whole-genome shotgun sequencing of Pseudomonas putida CBB5.
Aurko Dasgupta - Human practices, safety officer.
Peter Otoupal - Assayed Caffeinated Coli constructs built by Ben. Performed caffeinated beverage and caffeine growth tests for decaffeination operon.
Ben Slater - Constructed and tested pReporter and pReporter.permaflipped. Designed website's CSS stylesheet, navbar, and header. Assisted Peter and Erik with Caffeinated coli assays and construction.
Others
Prof. Mani Subramanian and Ryan Summers of the University of Iowa for generously sharing the Pseudomonas putida CBB5 strain with us.
Xi Chen of the Ellington Lab for the original pET plasmid containing the spinach aptamer.
Colleagues in the Spring 2012 CH 391L Synthetic Biology class at UT Austin for ideas and research that inspired these projects.
