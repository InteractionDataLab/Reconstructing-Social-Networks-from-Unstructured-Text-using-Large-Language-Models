Notebook for week of July 30 to August 5
Design of Converter Plasmid
Razan
7/31- Sequenced DNA prepped from gibson transformation colonies- plasmids had errors in sequence.
8/2- Redid gibson assembly reactions and re-transformed using filter before transformation.
Design of Reporter Plasmid
Spinach Aptamer
CBB5 Caffeine Inducible Promoters
Peter
7/31- Retry of cotransformation of PRA301-ndmApro LacZ reporter plasmid with orf1- 4,5,6 mini-preps. Used new miniprep from Ben, only 0.5 ul of each plasmid per transformation. 3 cotransformations, 4 single transformation for each plasmid.
8/1- 2 colonies picked from each cotransformation plate.
8/2- Glycerol stock saved of 1st colony from 1st cotransformation plate (ORF1-4 + ndmApro)
8/3- Transformation of ORF1-4 plasmid into TOP10 cells
Inducible Odor
