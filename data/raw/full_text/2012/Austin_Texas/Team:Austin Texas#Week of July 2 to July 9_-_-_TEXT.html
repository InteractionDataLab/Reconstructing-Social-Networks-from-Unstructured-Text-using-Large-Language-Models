Notebook for week of July 2 to July 8
Design of Converter Plasmid
Razan
7/2 - Overlap PCR of Las Promoter and GFP+Terminator for control plasmid.
7/5 - Amplification PCR of gel extracted band from overlap PCR.
Design of Reporter Plasmid
Peter
7/3 - PCR purification on both PCRs. Gibson assembly of purified PCR. Gel Electrophoresis indicated that Gibson assembly was unsuccessful, as insert ORF 1 PCR was unsuccessful while vector PCR was successful. Erik independently performed PCR on the ORF 1. Used this, along with Dpn1 digested vector PCR to create a new Gibson.
7/5 - Made new lab SOC under Aruko's supervision. Transformation of supposedly successful Gibson assembly
7/6 - Unsuccessful transformation. Made a new second attempt.
7/7 - Collected 3 successful small colonies from Gibson product assembly, as well as three obviously larger colonies from Gibson control plate which grew. Made cultures for each picked colony.
