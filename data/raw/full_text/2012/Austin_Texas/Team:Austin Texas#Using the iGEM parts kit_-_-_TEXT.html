Instructions for Resuspending DNA from the Parts Kit
Transformation Protocol for Kit Parts
Special Notes
After resuspending the DNA in the well in 10 µl of H2O, transfer into 1.5 ml tube and enter into lab database. You'll only need 1-2 µl for your transformation, so we can save the remainder in case there are problems with the plasmid in the colony that you happen to pick.
After you have colonies grown on the correct antibiotic plate, it is best practices to pick three colonies and save them as glycerol stocks. This way if the first one you miniprep is mutated, you can try these colonies first before retransforming.
