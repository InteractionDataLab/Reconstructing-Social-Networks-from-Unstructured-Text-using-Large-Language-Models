Design of Converter Plasmid
Razan
8/6- PCR on miniprepped DNA from gibson transformation colonies.
8/9- Submitted control colony DNA and pconverter colony DNA for sequencing with confirmed sequence results for 2 control colonies and one converter colony.
Design of Reporter Plasmid
Spinach Aptamer
CBB5 Caffeine Inducible Promoters
Peter
8/6- Picked 2 colonies form ORF1-4 transformation plate. 1st was large, 2nd was small
8/7- Glycerol stock saved of both ORF1-4 transformation colonies. Colony PCR began on both, with ORF1-4 plasmid as a control.
8/8- Miller Assay of ndmA Promoter with ORF's from CBB5 using various Xanthine derivatives.
8/9- More Miller Assays. Prepared new xanthine derivative stocks. Innoculated new Xanthine derivative cultures.
8/10- Miller Assays of yesterday's cultures.
