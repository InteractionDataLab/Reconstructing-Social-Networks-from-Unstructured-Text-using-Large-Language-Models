Genome extraction
Using gene extraction kit to isolate the whole genome of Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2
Gene isolate using PCR
Normal primer design and gradient PCR to amplify the gene.
Site mutation
Using the primer design by us, follow these tips:
1,Full length not less than 28bp;  2, 3'end to  mutation site not less than 18bp; 3, Mutation site to 5' end not less than 10bp.
Gene purification ,Enzyme digest, ligation and transformation
In our experiment, we found the vector (we used) is hard to digest by two enzyme in the same time, it cost us a long time on the identification the correct plamid, unfortunately, it was frustrating. at last, we follow the advice from the teacher, degest one by one, and have an self-ligation test in  order to have the correct digested vector.
In-fusion cloning and tranformation
we use this method for the ligation of 6 genes, but follow the instrction of the Clontech company, we may waste a lot of money on it, so we search methods from the paper, first, we test four-way ligation, however, it turn out to be no colony. so we test three-ligation. it was useful. Methods are as follows: Vector: more than 50ng; Gne inserts: more than 5:1 molar ratio to vector In-fusion enzyme: 2ul every 10ul reaction system ddH2O: Add water to 10ul
Sequensing
Done by company
Colony PCR Plasmid extraction
Colony PCR sometimes was not as convenient as we thougt. Sometimes plasmid extraction is better!
Double Digestion for chek
Temperament chromatography
for the function test of the degradation of the two enzyme gene.
