OVERALL PROJECT
Oil pollution is an increasingly grave environmental problem. Artificial hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium plays a critical role in the bioremediation of oil polluted marine systems.
Since this problem has long been tricky and not solved yet, we plan to construct a complex system to degrade oil spill in Escherichia coil, which mainly consists of 3 circuits: degradation circuit, emulsification circuit and stress tolerance circuit. Moreover, there are some other assistant circuits, RBS optimizing and subsequent dehydrogenation for example.
