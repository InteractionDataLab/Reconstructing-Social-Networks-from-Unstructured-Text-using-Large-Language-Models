Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:researcher safety,public safety, orenvironmental safety?
answer: no safety ,because the strains we use including DH-5a and BL-21 are safe,and the products are non-toxic.the strain is supposed to be safe ,but it should be kill in the hot water before pouring to the environment ,because the resistance gene may transfer to a wildtype strain ,even to different species.
Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
answer:no
Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
answer:no
Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
designing a plasmid and strain system,that specially match .only if the plasmid  in the unique strain ,would it amplify substantively.
