Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
No. None of our software projects raise research, public, or environmental safety issues.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise safety issues?
No. We do not plan to develop new parts in our projects.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at our institution?
We do not plan to conduct any wet experiments that involve DNA manipulation. Our instructors and advisors think our projects do not raise any safety problems.
4. Do you have any other ideas to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?
It might be helpful if there are more comprehensive learning materials that promote awareness of biosafety issues. It would be more desirable if the materials are interactive, as users can actively learn with fun.
