*Register the team, have a great summer, and have fun attending the Jamboree.
We registered our team, had a great summer & autumn, and are looking forward to having fun attending the Asia Jamboree!
*Create and share a description of the team's project via the iGEM wiki.
Here is our Project page.
*Present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
Now we are working hard for the Asia regional Jamboree! We will present a poster and talk!
*Develop and make available via the The Registry of Software Tools an open source software tool that supports synthetic biology based on BioBrick standard biological parts.
All our software is available on our Download page and the Registry of Software Tools .
Silver Medal
*Provide a second, distinct (yet complementary) software tools project.
We have created 4 distinct (yet at the same time complementary) software tools.
See a brief introduction of our software on our Project page.
*Provide a detailed, draft specification for the next version of your software tool.
Future application is explained for each of our software. They are available on each project page.
Go to BioBrick Puzzle , Gene Network Game , Past Project Search , BioBrick Search .
*Provide a demonstration of their software either as a textual or video tutorial made available on their wiki. This tutorial should explain all the features of the tool as well as provide sample input and output as appropriate.
Each of our software has its video tutorial. They are available on each project description page.
Go to BioBrick Puzzle , Gene Network Game , Past Project Search , BioBrick Search .
Gold Medal
*Have another team utilize the software developed by your team. You must clearly show how your software was used and the results that were obtained.
By announcing the tool “Biobrick Search” in August (See “ Community Page ”), it was used by a lot of teams, such as team UT-Tokyo from which we received feedback.
For example, since their team's main project is similar to team Tokyo-Tech's 2011 one, they've searched with restriction: team:Tokyo-Tech and year:2011. This team & year restriction enabled them to obtain the desired parts quickly. And they decided which parts to use in important parts such as ArgBox and terminator.
Also, they gave us a lot of feedback. So, we took their comments into consideration.
The main points of improvement are:
Save the history of the words you've searched at the top of the page.
Add a link to Parts Registry's page.
*Outline and detail how your software effects Human Practices in Synthetic Biology. Such topics include: safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
・Sharing :
Our “ BioBrick Search ” allows you to search the desired BioBrick parts quickly.
This means that you can access the accumulated knowledge of past iGEM projects quite easily.
It also enables users to share the knowledge of BioBrick parts, which will result in determining the parts to use much easier.
・Human Practice :
Our educational software tutorials (“ BioBrick Puzzle ” and “ Gene Network Game ”) made synthetic biology easier to approach.
We think it would be beneficial in human practice, especially for beginners in that it could help them take part in the field much easier.
Also, these tutorials may be helpful when you want to give lessons in synthetic biology to newcomers. So, tutorials may expand the scope of synthetic biology.
*Develop and document a new technical standard that supports : the sharing of BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA or as information via the internet.
Our software, “ BioBrick Search ” allows the sharing of the information of BioBrick Parts information via internet.
Best Interaction with the Parts Registry
*Propose an alternate interaction with the registry. Clearly document this on your wiki in a page explicitly dedicated to this aspect of your tool. You should clearly show how to use this tool in a design flow used by experimental iGEM teams.
Our software, “ BioBrick Search ” propose an alternate interaction with the registry.
BioBrick Search improves PartsRegistry in that :
Search result is sorted by combination of 3 factors (reliability, relevance to your query and popularity)
Filters can be set by various conditions, such as year submitted, team name, category
->Users can obtain desired parts quickly.
User-friendly interface
->Users can easily know the parts information, such as which team used the parts.
Detailed explanations are here .
And the tutorial video explains how to use this search.
Also, Collaboration page shows how this tool was used by an experimental team, UT-Tokyo.
