As our iGEM project, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is planned to be modifed in such a way that the yeast cell should function as a biosensor for the human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG). This hormone is produced in the body during pregnancy and consequently, the idea for the biosensor is to function as a simple pregnancy test. We also plan to introduce genes for bio-indigo production which will be the output signal of the pregnancy test.
