Conclusion
iGEM - Bordeaux - Overview
This project aims at creating a regulatory system in the bacteria Escherichia coli. Our main goal is to engineer a single strain of bacteria able produce concentric patterns on the dishes. The challenge is to model a regulatory mechanism which mimics both cell differentiation and cell-tocell communication observed in eukaryotes.
We chose to create four operons (a total of 21 assemblies): three to allow the communication and expression of a visible phenotype, the forth containing the genes needed for signal transduction. Each of the three first operons will respond to a specific quorum-sensing system (QSS) and trigger another QSS resulting in a chain reaction communicating a unique signal to all bacteria nearby.
