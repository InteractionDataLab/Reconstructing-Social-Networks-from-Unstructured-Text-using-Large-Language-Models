Bordeaux - City
Bordeaux (French pronunciation: [bɔʁ.do] ; Gascon: Bordèu; Basque: Bordele) is a port city on the Garonne River in the       Gironde department in southwestern France.       The Bordeaux metropolitan area has a population of 1,105,000 and constitutes the sixth-largest urban area in France. It is the        capital of the Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called Bordelais.       Bordeaux is the world's major wine industry capital. It is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo, while the wine        economy in the metro area moves 14.5 billion euros each year. Bordeaux wine has been produced in the region since the       8th century. The historic part of the city is on the UNESCO World Heritage List as "an outstanding urban and        architectural ensemble" of the 18th century (Wikipedia Source Article ).
