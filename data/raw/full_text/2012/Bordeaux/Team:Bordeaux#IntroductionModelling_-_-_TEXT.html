Conclusion
iGEM - Bordeaux - Introduction
Our IGEM project aim to create a regulation system into the bacteria (a strain of Escherichia coli). The goal of that project is to have just one strain of bacteria able to create concentric patterns on flat surfaces. The challenge consist of modeling a regulation mecanism that mimic the cellular differentiation and cellular communication seen with eucaryotes.
We have first decided to make a modeling and simulation software of that regulation system. This first step will permit us to test several parameters and try some variations of the concentration and others factors involved (reduction of the activity of some operon, etc ). This parts we hope will give us the best conditions for our next biological manipulations.
