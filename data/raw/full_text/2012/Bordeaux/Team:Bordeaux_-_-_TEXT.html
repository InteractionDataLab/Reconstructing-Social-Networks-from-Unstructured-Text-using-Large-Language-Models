Synthetic Biology
Bordeaux Project Summary
Our project aims at reproducing multicellular-like behavior in the bacteria Escherichia coli. The idea came from the patterns visible on some animals, like the “pseudo-eyes” on a butterfly wing. As well, we thought about the formation of stripes on tigers or zebra. Such patterns are created thanks to a very precise genetic regulation. So what we want to do here is modeling a regulation mechanism existing in eukaryotes in a simple organism. The bacteria will share the same DNA but should be able to display a different phenotype depending on the signal received by its neighbors. The phenotype here will be the expression of three different colors. The bacteria should be able to communicate between them. A light signal is used as the first inducer of our mechanism. Then, the first cells activated by the input signal send a signal to its neighbor that will react to it by changing its color, and sending another message to the next cell. This will allow us to draw different patterns on the petri dish.

Modelling - Python - Script
Our IGEM project aim to create a regulation system into the bacteria (a strain of Escherichia coli). The goal of that project is to have just one strain of bacteria able to create concentric patterns on flat surfaces. The challenge consist of modeling a regulation mecanism that mimic the cellular differentiation and cellular communication seen with eucaryotes.
We have first decided to make a modeling and simulation software of that regulation system. This first step will permit us to test several parameters and try some variations of the concentration and others factors involved (reduction of the activity of some operon, etc ). This parts we hope will give us the best conditions for our next biological manipulations.
