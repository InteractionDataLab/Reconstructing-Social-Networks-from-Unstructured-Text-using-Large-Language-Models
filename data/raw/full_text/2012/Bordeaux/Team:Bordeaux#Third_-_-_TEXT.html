Day 10 : 16-07-2012
This week we decided to make our own competent cells Regarding the bad/average results we had with our commercial DH5α and XL1blue we decided to try with DH10B strain We followed the protocol proposed by the patregistry.org Read Protocol
Day 11 : 17-07-2012
Day 2 of making new competent cells Read Protocol We stopped incubating our cells at an OD600nm of 0.31 In the end we made 192 tubes of 50μL competent cells.
Day 12 : 18-07-2012
The competence test gave good results with a good amount of colonies on each plates ( ≈ 300 ) and no colonies on the control plate. Today we will transform DNA for every biobrick left. We will use our new competent cells.
We will proceed by heat-shock as described in the partregistry.org protocol Read Protocol
Day 13 : 19-07-2012
Today we picked single colonies and put the to grow in two 5 mL LB + Ampicilin 100μg/mL Except for 3.B who gave no colonies We put the tubes to incubate overnight at 37°C
Day 14 : 20-07-2012
After 13 hours incubating we did a miniprep with the tubes. We got really poor results on the nanodrop for every biobrick (>3ng/μL). As we had really small cells pellets after the first centrifugation we suspect we didn't have enough cells in the beginning.
