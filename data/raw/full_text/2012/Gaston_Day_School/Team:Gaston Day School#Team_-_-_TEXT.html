What We Did
We developed Cadmium, Arsenic, and Lead detectors by combining responsive promoters with Green Fluorescent Protein reporters.
Where We're From
Founded in 1967, Gaston Day School is a non-sectarian, college preparatory institution for grades Pre-K through 12. Throughout our history, nearly 100% of Gaston Day School's classes have entered four-year colleges and universities immediately upon graduation. Located in Gastonia, North Carolina, the school serves communities in a ﬁve-county area: Gaston, Lincoln, Cleveland, Mecklenburg and York counties. Enrollment is approximately 500 students. Gaston Day School is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The school is a member of the Southern Association of Independent Schools, the National Association of Independent Schools, and the North Carolina Association of Independent Schools. Each of the students on the team has completed (or is currently in) Honors Biology, Honors Chemistry, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, Honors Physics or some combination thereof.
