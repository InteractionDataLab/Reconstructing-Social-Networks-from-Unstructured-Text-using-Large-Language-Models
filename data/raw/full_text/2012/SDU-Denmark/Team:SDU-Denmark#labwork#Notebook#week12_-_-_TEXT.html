We started ligating genes into the shipping plasmid pSB1C3, but we were still having problems. Meanwhile we ligated them succesfully into pSB1K3 and started ligating promoters, genes and reporter sequences together aswell. By the end of the week this still showed little result. Since 1-SST and 1-FFT got a promoter, they have been impossible to grow (again!). We tried our luck with PCR of the sequences to avoid having to grow them, which eventually seemed to succeed, but did not ligate properly into the reporter part by standard assembly, since no colonies grew.
In lack of time, we decided to go full out on ligating our genes into pSB1C3, which eventualy succeeded at the end of the week. The genes in pSB1C3 were sent to iGEM HQ and sequencing immedietly.
In the end, we only just managed to ligate 1-FFT into a promoter(R0010)-FFT(K899001)-RBS+GFP+Terminator(E0240)
