Interview by EJC Online Journalism Community
Recently we have seen an increasing number of cooking programs on TV, most of them, not really teaching the viewers how to cook, but spreading a culture of "unhealthy habits". If after the movie "Supersize Me", some people have avoided eating at the Mac's, yet, we still have a lot to learn regarding our food habits and many of the things we believed were healthy 10 years ago, might be unhealthy now.
Somehow, science seems to be here to become a controversial item in our menu while the powerful lobby of giant food companies are getting its way through the Media. No wonder we are constantly getting contradictory messages that in the end affect our pockets and our metabolism.
Fortunatelly, the debate is attracting young scientists as well and inviting the public to rething their food habits. In Denmark, a team of talented students went a step further to find an enzyme that can actually help us to eliminate the problem! They are on the race and working hard to win a competion called IGEM while developing their wonderful discovery. Unfortunately, they do not get as much publicity as Gordon Ramsey or Jamie Oliver, and they are searching now for sponsors in order to continue their project on the FIGHTING against OBESITY.
Directly from the Southern university of Denmark, Malou Reedorf, sent me detailed information on their project which you can read here and get to know more about this innovative idea here .
In an exclusive interview to SIJ TV, for the ​​​​​​​​​​​​​SIJ - STUDENTS & INNOVATION JOURNAL,​​​​​​ Asbjørn, tell us about the IGEM project in the video here below
