Collaboration With the Team from Bielefeld University, Germany
In August we visited the iGEM team from Bielefeld University. They had invited us to be a part of their Street Science, which is a common day where most of the iGEM teams from Germany get a chance to stand on the street in their city and talk to people about synthetic biology, iGEM and their projects. Street Science is a way to educate and inform the general public about iGEM. In Bielefeld, this was done with microscopes, DNA isolations from fruits, pipetting of watercolors and competitions with eppendorf tubes and pipette tips. Both their team and ours had posters of our projects as well to tell people about our ideas.
In Bielefeld we also presented our projects to each other. Afterwards we gave feedback and asked questions to help each other. We discussed many things, but some of the key points were the modeling aspect, human practices, the wiki page and last but not least, different kinds of regulations for improving GMO safety. See the pictures in our Photo Gallery! Take a look at their collaboration page here!
