Another checkdigest was made on SST colonies, we had our doubts about the entegrity of the formerly used restriction enzyme, so a newer EcoRI was used, a get was made and this time we got results. After a checkdigest that showed bands at expected lengths and nanodrop, two samples of 1-SST was sent for sequencing.
4 days later we recieved results from sequencing. As we expected from the original ncbi sequences, the genes contained illegal restriction sites.
1-SST contained 1 SpeI restriction site and 1-FFT had 1 EcoRI and 1 XbaI.
Primers for mutagenesis were constructed and ordered with the help of our supervisor Steffen Schmidt
