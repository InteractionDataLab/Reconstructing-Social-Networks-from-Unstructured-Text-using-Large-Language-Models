            The iGEM Team of University of Southern Denmark 2012
<FONT color="FF6600"><B>igem.sdu.2012@gmail.com</B></FONT></DIV><DIV id="contenta"><H1> Overview</H1><P>The Human Practices part is extremely important for our team this year. Our Goal is to make a massive outreach and spread the iGEM word at the University among the students as well as throughout the non-specialists. 

This year we participate in the “start of the academic year” fair. This is a huge fair at the University which attract many people every year. We expect a number of visitors about 3000 people over two days. For this we have made some pens as a promotional gift. Furthermore we have been so lucky to receive a package of different merchandise from the iGEM Foundation. From our point of view it is very important that the visitors have something to remember us by when they go home. It is also a great opportunity to make people stop and talk to them about iGEM and how it is to do scientific research. Read more about it and see the pictures on our <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/HumanPractices/outreach"><B>Outreach</B></A> page.

As a part of the Human Practices plan, we will be noticeable in the everyday life at the University in several ways - Indirect and outspoken. You can also read more about this on our <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/HumanPractices/outreach"><B>Outreach</B></A> page.

During September we launched a campaign so that we are certain that the students and professors have seen and recognize the iGEM logo. This is the base for the recruitment campaign. This year we didn't have many volunteers, and we want to remedy this. Just like at the “start of the academic year” fair we will reach out to people at the University on several occasions and talk to them, telling how great an experience participating in iGEM has been. As a matter of fact, we have already gotten emails from people who want to participate next year. 

The press is also a big part of our Human Practices. You can read all about it on our <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Media/Press"><B>Press</B></A> page in the menu at the left.

Additionally to the campaigns we have had close contact with our opponent group from Bielefeld. Together we participated at the “Street science” in front of the town hall in Bielefeld. The idea was to talk to the laypeople in a fun way showing them how to use a pipette and so forth. Taking them closer to the laboratory. This you can also read more about on our <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/collaboration/bielefeld"><B>Collaboration</B></A> page and look at pictures in our <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Media/photogallery/Bielefeld"><B>gallery</B></A>. 

It is not just Bielefeld we have worked with. In the beginning of September we went to a great Scandinavian iGEM convention in Uppsala. We met with the other teams from Scandinavia to present our projects for each other and talk about different aspects of iGEM. Here we also took part in workshops about human practices, funding, “working as a team” and laboratory experiences. Read more about it on our <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/collaboration/Uppsala"><B>Collaboration</B></A> page too.
