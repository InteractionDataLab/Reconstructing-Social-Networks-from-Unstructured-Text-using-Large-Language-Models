Documentary
We have had the great possibility to have a documentary made about us. One day a former worker at the local news station came and asked if he could be allowed to make a documentary about us. He would make it so that a layman could watch it and learn from it. The story was to tell about the competition and the story about students who spends all of their summer vacation in the lab.
He followed us almost two weeks and filmed a lot of hours in the lab and got a lot of interviews with the team members and our supervisors. In the end we got a great movie that gives the audience an idea of what iGEM and science is, and how it is to work in a lab.
