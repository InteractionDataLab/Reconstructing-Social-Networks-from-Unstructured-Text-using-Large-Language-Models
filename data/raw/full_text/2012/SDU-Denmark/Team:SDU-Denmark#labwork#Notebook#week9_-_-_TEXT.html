After 48 hours in the incubator, the 1-FFT colonies finaly reached a high enough concentration for sequencing.
Meanwhile, all the SST colonies had died out. To avoid unnecesary excess work, we simply ran PCR with all mutagenesis primers on an older 1-SST containing pJET plasmid. Miraculous, both gel band length and check digest on the resulting sequence yielded perfect results. Why had we not done this before?
In the following days 1-SST ligated into pJET, grown on ampicillin plates, transformed into Top10, transfered to liquid medium and miniprepped for sequencing.
