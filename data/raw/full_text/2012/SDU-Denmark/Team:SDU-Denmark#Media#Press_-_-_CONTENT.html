	To reach as many people as possible, we have contacted a lot of different media in Denmark. Therefore we have been in touch with both newspapers, magazines and television, locally and nationally. We have also been contacted by a former worker of a Danish broadcast station called TV2, which would like to make a short documentary. The documentary should tell the audience about the iGEM idea, and about a young team of scientists who create a new organism. The documentary is meant for the layman. To see the documentary please go to the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Media/Documentary">documentary. </A>

We are very pleased with the outcome. We reach out to a broad range of both scientific and non scientific audience of common people as well as both the new and the experienced students of SDU. Because of the article in NyViden (SDU magazine) we also reach the Humanitarian and the students who study social science. We consider it to have great importance that the iGEM teams consist of interdisciplinarity. This is also something our Human Practice group work intensively on. 
Furthermore a student that studies Business and Law came to us, and would like to write a article about us in <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/Media/Press/interviewEJC">Interview by European Journalism Centre </A>

The magazine for faculty of Health, Sund &amp; Hed, wrote a large <A href="http://sundoghed.dk/7038/igem-verdens-storste-konkurrence-indenfor-syntetisk-biologi-vender-tilbage-til-sdu/?fb_comment_id=fbc_365648506787388_4738817_366895283329377"> article </A> about the iGEM competition in general.

We would like to tell the society first and foremost, that studying science is fun! We would like to inform of the many possibilities there are when you go to the University and how many great opportunities students have to do something extra if they want to. It is also essential to tell about synthetic science because many people are unaware of the potential and maybe even looks at it with fear. To communicate that part we have established a special “media ethics” group. 

We have discovered that the media is of great value when it comes to especially funding. It is important for the sponsors that they get some credit and that they support something that is popular these days. The university has also expressed that they are quite pleased with the media coverage of the project in the light of that they are our main sponsor. A news paper has been writing about us and our financial situation. The article brought the issue into focus that it is difficult to raise money for student based projects like iGEM.
