Scandinavian Meet-up
Uppsala University chose this year to host the first annual meeting of the iGEM teams in Scandinavia. The invited teams were, Chalmers University from Gothenburg, University of Copenhagen, our university and the university in Trondheim. We met the first weekend in September both to get to know each other better and to prepare us for Regional Jamboree. The trip was therefore both social and scientific. During the visit, we presented our projects to each other and gave feedback and criticism to help the other teams. Later we also had a visit from Herbert Boyer where we made our presentations for him, he asked us questions and helped us with our presentations.
The team from Uppsala had also planned some workshops so the teams could discuss methods and results to get a better understanding of what other teams had done in the various subjects. The subjects were: How to build your team?, Sponsoring, Keeping track of the lab & Human Practices.
See the pictures in our Photo Gallery! It was a great experience for us, and we have already decided to have next year’s annual meeting in Odense at University of Southern Denmark.
