Primary Nucleaic Acid Sequence
The gene sequence can be found through the link by clicking on 'Get selected sequences'. The same goes for the FFT. Here is the link
Description of Function
Sucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase (SST)  is one out of two necessary enzymes to produce inulin. The function of SST is to make a tri-saccharide with sucrose as substrate. Two molecules of sucrose is transformed to either 1-kestose or neokestose which is a precursor to inulin. Fructan:Fructan  fructosyltransferase (FFT) is the next necessary enzyme in inulin production. This enzyme has the ability to polymerize the tri-saccharide SST made and elongate the chain with fructose molecules. Both enzymes is from the glycosyltransferase family and are originally expressed in some plants.
Authorship
The original idea for the project is built entirely on the thoughts and ideas of the team's ten participants. All theoretical text and hypotheses about the project is likewise done by the iGEM team. It is known that both plants and bacteria can produce fructosyltransferase but with a different degree of polymerizing of inulin. The plants need two enzymes and the bacteria only one. Our idea is based on introducing the two plant enzymes into bacteria with none. No other has so far tried to construct  a bacteria like ours and therefore all documentation on this subject on our wiki page is made by ourselves.
Safety Notes
See our kill-switch system and considerations on avoiding horizontal gene transfer under Constructs .
