This kind of ethics can be classified into subgroups; consequence-based ethics, duty-based ethics, contract ethics and naturalistic ethics. 
In consequence-based ethics the actions value is judged on the consequences it might have. The goal justifies the means because it is the consequence and not the action itself that has value. An example of consequence-based ethics is the utilitarianism and the utility-based ethic of Bentham. According to utilitarianism the moral worth of an action is determined only by its resulting outcome although there is debate over how much consideration should be given to actual consequences. He introduces a method of calculating the value of pleasures and pains, which has come to be known as the hedonic calculus. Bentham says that the value of a pleasure or pain, considered by itself, can be measured according to its intensity, duration, certainty/uncertainty, purity, fruitfulness, propinquity/remoteness and prevalence. 
The opposite apply for the duty-based ethic. Here the goal do not justifies the means. The idea is that ethics is a moral law within ourselfs. Whether or not an action is right or wrong, depends on a person’s disposition. 
The contract ethic is built on a contract between an individual and the society. Ethic responsibility arise form of a contract. Ethic in this branch is seen as a social phenomenon. The individual’s freedom is protected by the contract. The contract ethic is based on justices. It operates with two principles of justices: 
- Any person has the right to comprehensive and fundamental freedom, which is consistent with the freedom of others. 
- Social and economically discrepancy is to be organized so that: </P><LI><P>They are in aid of everyone.</P></LI><LI><P>They are bound to positions and occupations open to everyone.</P></LI><P>In naturalistic ethics, the natural is right and the unnatural is wrong. Put in another way – to be reasonable is in our nature. The reason is what should dominate our choices but then again, our desires is also what control us and therefore natural. </P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
