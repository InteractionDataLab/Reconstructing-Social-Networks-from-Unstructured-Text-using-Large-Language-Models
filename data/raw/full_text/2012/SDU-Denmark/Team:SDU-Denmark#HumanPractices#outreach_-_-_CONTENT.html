            The iGEM Team of University of Southern Denmark 2012
<FONT color="FF6600"><B>igem.sdu.2012@gmail.com</B></FONT></DIV><DIV id="contenta"><H1>Outreach</H1><H2> Fair - At the Beginning of the Academic Year</H2><P>The studies fair is a great exhibition with roughly  3000 visitors. It stretches over two days where both companies and unions from industry, associations and cultural life are represented.
The fair is a free service for students and other interested parties. We had the opportunity to create a great first impression of what we can offer students at the university interested in either joining next year's team or maybe even help us this year. We did this both to spread the word about iGEM and to raise awareness for students and staff at the university.
We got a great benefit from the fair, since we got a lot of attention from students from other faculties who also thought it would be exciting to be involved in iGEM. Their interest for participating was not the ‘typical’ science researcher aspect, but more to help with the wiki, modeling, ethics, public relations and much more. In addition to this, there were of course many science students who were interested in being involved next year, to them we had made ​​a Facebook group where we update with information about registration, etc.</P><H2> Flyers &amp; Posters - At the University</H2><P>In addition to the fair we have also been hanging up posters and giving out flyers about iGEM on the university. This year iGEM did not have any enrollments from other than us who are on the team. Although it was great to all who wanted to be with, it would be nice with some more attention to the concept. Therefore we decided to do a campaign to increase interest in iGEM at university.</P><H2> Street Science</H2><P>In Bielefeld we participated in “Street Science” as a part of their outreach. You can read more about this on our <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark/collaboration/bielefeld"><B>collaboration</B></A> page.
