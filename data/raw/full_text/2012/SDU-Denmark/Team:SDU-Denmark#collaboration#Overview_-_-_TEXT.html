The iGEM Team of University of Southern Denmark 2012 igem.sdu.2012@gmail.com
Overview
We have had close contact with our opponent group from Bielefeld, Germany. Together we participated at the german “Street Science” in front of the town hall in Bielefeld. The idea was to talk to the laypeople in a fun way showing them how to use a pipette and so forth. Taking them closer to the laboratory. Remember to take a look at pictures in our gallery .
It is not just Bielefeld we have worked with. In the beginning of September we went to a great Scandinavian iGEM convention in Uppsala. We met with the other teams from Scandinavia to present our projects for each other and talk about different aspects of iGEM. Here we also took part in workshops about human practices, funding, “working as a team” and laboratory experiences. Visit our gallery too! During this year's iGEM competition, we were involved in the making of a informational video in cooperation with several other iGEM teams around the world. Very early on it was decided that the product of our labor should be focused on the ethical aspects of synthetic biology but also teach the public about iGEM and synthetic biology in general and that we, as scientist take the ethical issues regarding genetic manipulation seriously. This resulted in a nearly ten minute long mini documentary that you can watch here
