It was important for us to have a common communication platform that is easy to use and works well with several users. We decided that Facebook would work for now, for discussions and announcements, and Google Docs/Drive for documents. For scheduling meetings we decided to use Doodle. 
In addition, we also discussed different subjects for our project, talked about the teams expectations and how to help each other.</P><P><B>29.03.12:</B></P><H2>iGEM team registration accepted and registration fee paid </H2><P><B>31.03.12:</B></P><H2>Registration of team members individually</H2><P><B>09.04.12:</B></P><H2>Team Meeting </H2><P>We discussed and limited our subjects and problems.

We voted for the best topic and began a discussion about how it should be approached.</P><P><B>24.04.12:</B></P><H2>Team Meeting </H2><P>Project organization. The team met to discuss our subjects before meeting with our supervisors. 
We tried to limit our subject choices. When our supervisors joined the meeting, we did a round of “meet and greet” between the participants and the supervisors. Afterwards, we did a short presentation for the supervisors of our chosen subjects.
We decided that the aim of our next meeting should be to decide on our final subject for the project. The team members all chose an idea they wanted to present for the rest of the team so that we could make our decision.
Team Bielefeld-Germany asked whether or not we would like to be sparring team with them, which we of course said yes to. We also plan to visit them during the summer.</P><P><B>26.04.12:</B></P><H2>Team Building :) </H2><P>We gathered for a night of pizza, fun and games!</P><P><B>29.04.12:</B></P><H2>Symposium </H2><P>We had presentations from previously iGEM contestants who informed us about the iGEM concept and synthetic biology.</P><P><B>07.05.12:</B></P><H2>Team Meeting </H2><P>We finally agreed on a subject for our project; A bacteria that can convert sugar to a fiber the human body cannot absorb. Making it easier to lose or not gain weight.
During the meeting we also did a distribution of different tasks, such as choosing who would be responsible for various groups such as funding, lab work, the podcast with Cornell etc. We also divided the team into these subdivisions: A funding group, a wiki group, a podcast group and a group that would stay in touch with the iGEM team from Bielefeld, Germany.</P><P><B>14.05.12:</B></P><H2>Team Meeting </H2><P>We discussed why obesity is such a huge problem and how we could design our project to solve this problem. We agreed to make a bacteria that can survive in our stomach and transform sugar to inulin. the human body can't absorb inulin and furthermore inulin have a positive effect on the already existing `good` bacteria we have in our stomach.
Besides this, we also had an update from the groups of their whereabouts and achievements.</P><P><B>24.05.12:</B></P><H2>Meeting with our supervisors</H2><P>We talked about BioBrick techniques and what kind of materials we would need in the lab.
