Laboratory Safety
Common sense
When working in a laboratory, it is crucial to live up to the safety protocols that are applied.  This involves working in an aseptic environment, proper handling of chemicals, understanding of the use of equipment and common sense. We had the opportunity to work in a class 1 laboratory with gene modified organisms. All SDU iGEM members were handed out a document explaining the safety masseurs when working with gene technology. This document had to be read and fully understood before signing to these agreements. This document described, among other things, how to handle GMO and the risk it involves.  Cell- and medie waste of gen modified material is treated with vikon or autoclaved and from there handled as biohazard. We have at all time been working with a non-pathogenic E. coli strain which have clear guidelines how to be handled in the laboratory. To ensure safety, they are handled as if they were pathogenic to lower the risk of any hazardous incident.
Protection
Gloves and a lab coat are used not only to protect what you are working with for contamination but also to ensure protection against toxic chemicals, radiation and other waste products. This has been an experience for the SDU iGEM team when constructing a gel for electrophoresis where mutagenic ethidium bromide is used to detect DNA when exposed to UV-light. When cutting out bands from the gel, UV-emission is also a risk. Therefore it is mandatory to have a lab coat on, to decrease the radiation.
