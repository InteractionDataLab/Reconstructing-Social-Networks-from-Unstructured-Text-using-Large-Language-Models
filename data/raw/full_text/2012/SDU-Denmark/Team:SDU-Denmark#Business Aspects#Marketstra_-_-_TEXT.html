SLIM
Makes your life easy
We will in the following create a marketing plan for the new product called SLIM, standing for Sucrose Limitation and Insulin Metabolism.
The first thing we are going to look at is the target group to whom we are going to sell this product to. There are two kinds of target groups for this product, the group which is the user of the product, and the group which is going to purchase the product. The last one is a part of the first group. We want the modern family, who is aware of their health, to be the main target group. We know that it’s the woman in the family, who is going to purchase this product, which means that she is the strategic target group. The woman acts as the ambassador compared to the rest of the target group.  Therefor most of the sales promotion will be directed to the modern woman. This means, that most of the blackboard advertisement and the advertise in the magazines will be directed towards women, but the TV commercial could for example represent the whole family, so that we emphasize, that this is a product for the entire family. The places we want to use to communicate our product, we will get back to later in this text.
One of the most important things to understand, when you are going to have a new product on the market is the decision-making of the group who is going to perceive the product. This means that we have to understand the process, when a woman is going to buy a new product. You can make a chain to show how the perceiver is going to act from beginning to end:
It is very important with a high frequency, because the customers will have a low credibility and loyalty when it is a new product on the market. Therefor we have to make sure, that our target group is going to be exposed to the advertisement often.
When we start to promote our product, we are going to make a lot of tastings, where people can taste this new product. This is important because the customers might compare it to another diet product, and lots of them don’t taste well. So we want to paint the prejudice to the ground and get them to taste our product. We will also make some competitions to make people aware of the product and the brand. An example to a competition could be that the customer has to collect the bottle top and when they have collected enough they can win a trip.
The places we want to position our product is in broadcast media like television, in printed medias where we are going to have advertises in magazines, and on outdoor media like billboards and on the side of busses. The places we are going to send the commercial in television are the Danish channel TV2, which is a channel for the entire family, and then we want to have the product in a daily program called “Good evening Denmark”, where they discuss the daily news. The magazines we are going to have a advertisement in are “Femina” (a popular fashion magazine for women in Denmark), “Spis Bedre” (a magazine that focuses on good food and includes recipes), “I form” (a magazine that focuses on body and health) and some free like “Kiwi” and “SKØN”, because we know, that the most read magazines are the ones which are free.
When we take a look at the long-term, we are going to use product placement, for example in TV-shows, where you see a family you can relate to drink SLIM.
The shops where we are going distribute SLIM in Denmark are, Føtex, Bilka, Netto and Kvickly. Common for them all is that they are available all over the country and has our target group as costumers.
Our communication strategy is that we are going to be honest and open-minded, so that we don’t hide anything from our customers. We want to communicate to our target group that we only want to help them and make their life easier. We also want to communicate that this is a nature product without any additives.
We have made some suggestions to the flavor of SLIM, but in the beginning we are going to introduce the market for two kinds of tastes. This could be the ones with blueberry/strawberry and with passion fruit/mango. Below we have listed all the tastes we want to introduce in the future:
The classic one:
Blueberry/ strawberry
Raspberry/pomegranate
The exotic one:
Passion fruit/ mango
The child-friendly one:
Banana/peach
We would like the bottle to be made of a reusable material and to be a 250 ml. slim bottle. It has to radiate something naturally and have a simple design and exclusive design.
The slogan of this product has to be something that people will remember so that they will recognize and think of the product when they see or hear the slogan. The slogan we have suggested for SLIM is “Makes your life simple”.
The price for one bottle of SLIM is 3,44 $ (2,68 €) because we want to be a more exclusive brand than the other brands on the market that also sells drinking yogurt. This is because SLIM isn’t just only a drinking yogurt but do also have a positive functional effect on the body.
It could be fun to actually get SLIM on the market and to see the development for this product.
