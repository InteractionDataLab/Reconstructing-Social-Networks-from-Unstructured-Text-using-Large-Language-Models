To bypass the growth problem of our bacteria, we spent this week on preparing to transfer the genes into iGEM plasmids.
While preparing the plasmids we also prepared cultures of the promoter R0010, GFP coding sequence E0040 and terminator B0015.
At the end of the week we attempted digestion and ligation into pSB1C3, but something mysterious and unexpected happened: we got red colonies, and we had no idea where they came from. We hadnt touched any RFP containing sequences and the partsregistry page for the linearized plasmid said nothing of RFP in the biobrick. Our best guess is that the linearized plasmid is isolated from something that contain RFP.
