Curing Obesity with SLIM - The Right Way to Proceed?
Before you make a product it is a good idea to do an impact analysis, not only for the individual but also for society as a whole.
The consequences dealing with our bacteria are both for and against.
Against
One can argue that there could occur a greater overconsumption in the western world as it to some degree would be possible to eat more without gaining weight. There will be no more appearance-related obstacles by eating, only the financial margin in the household. A natural reaction to this could be increasing of taxes on unhealthy foods because society ultimately cannot defend the production of so much more food to the individuals with the ever-increasing population.
Another problem is that even though it does not have adverse consequences to convert all of the "bad sugar" to inulin, they still have all the additives that are added to the manufactured food. Let us take the example of cola cola, which contains plenty of phosphorus that is extremely harmful to the body in large quantities.
In line with the above, this may result in more obesity because people are not informed well enough about the product. If the product is not promoted properly, it is possible that people will eat more unhealthy than they did previously, and therefore gain more weight, because there will typically be some fat consumed too.
There could arise a misuse of food, greater than seen today, where people either overeat or only eat things with sugar, which is degraded and thus used for energy, bordering on anorexia. The defence of overeating is that the inulin gives a greater feeling of satiety and fullness, which ultimately should give you less desire to overeat. You should be aware that the product is likely to reduce desire for food after the conversion of sugar to inulin, which means that you can go for long periods without being hungry if you just consume a little sugar once in a while. It is a genuine concern that you fight the symptoms of obesity, but not the problem itself. In many cases the eating disorders, whether the case is of overeating or anorexia, are a reaction to mental instability. It could be a possibility to use the money you save on obesity, to assist with psychologists and therapy.
Without the right guidance for the product, people could also quit exercising, and eventually become indifferent to their lifestyle because they can "eat themselves slim". It is also conceivable that there was even more emphasis on living up to the ideals of beauty, as it with the product will be "easier" to stay thin. A downside to this, however, could be that it was more sought after to do it in other, and more unhealthy ways, than by exercising.
There will be a greater potential for fast food manufacturers. For example, people in the U.S. cannot necessarily afford to buy healthy and wholesome food, and therefore it is easier to buy unhealthy food. Our product promotes this attitude because by taking these bacteria, you would be able to cut down on the absorbing calories. This is both a good and a bad consequence. A bad side of this is that it makes it easier for people to stick with fast food, which also means that you do not get the vitamins you need, because they do not eat sufficiently varied, as most of their consumption is fast food. One can then from a political side consider whether any sanctions on sugary food could be a solution to America's obesity problem. This can obviously cause problems for our product, because people will no longer be able to afford to buy unhealthy foods, and our product would lose market share, as there is no need for it to the same extent. But in the end, this scenario will be the goal of our product - namely the elimination of obesity.
There are also side effects of the product, but the theoretical bad side effects are far outweighed by the positives.
These points clarifies that, with an over the counter product on the market, it puts high demands on society and producers about informing consumers so that they have a sensible approach to the product and is aware of the pitfalls that are associated with this.
Ethical Arguments Against
The ethical counter arguments for our product are that it is unnatural when you consume something that prevents the body from absorbing anything it would otherwise have done. It is debatable whether there are unforeseen consequences or not. The theoretical consequences are, at most, increased gas in the intestines, which are not harmful to the consumer.
For
People take up less of the unhealthy sugar and thereby prevent the part of the risk of being overweight. This reduces a variety of diseases related to obesity, and can save the state and families money on for example medications. It must be assumed that people are healthier when they are not overweight, and thus does not wear out to their bodies and organs to the same extent.
Those who have neither the money nor the time to buy healthy food still have a chance to look and appear healthy. This is of great importance mentally and it is typically easier to get a job and interact in society when you are not overweight. People are happier when they look good and they feel much better about themselves. It will affect many factors in a person's life and relationships with other people. The majority of bullying in schools is typically caused by obesity. Bullying at an early age lays the foundation for mental instability later in life. The fact that you remove a part of the reason for harassment will help prevent mental disorders.
The product has a lot of positive side effects that include healthier intestinal bacteria, increased satiety, increased feeling of fullness, easier weight loss and possible prevention of intestinal cancer.
There is a great economic benefit for companies that produce our product, as there is a market for it, especially in the United States. This is elaborated in the marketing part. At the same time, there is a lot of money to be saved for the hospitals and the state if the population overcomes the obesity epidemic. Instead, you can use the money in a more sensible place, namely by preventing obesity and by informing about better eating habits.
An article in "Ekstra Bladet" shows that obesity costs the Danish society up to 14.4 billion each year. This includes obesities lack of effort in the labor market. Obese people impact the environment through increased pollution. It is every seventh Dane who is overweight. There dies up to 1400 persons per year. This is equivalent to 2 percent of all deaths.
Ethical Arguments for
It is unnatural, but we live in an unnatural world. People today are already using diet products, they are on different diets and gets gastric bypass to become slim. Therefore, our product is natural, and possibly healthier choice for dieting and obesity prevention. It is natural for us to use the resources that are in the communities we live in.
We have an obligation to do something about problems when there are solutions to it. While it can be argued that you have an obligation to not be overweight if possible, and use the proper funds there are available on the market if you cannot make do with exercise and healthy eating. Obesity is incredibly expensive for the society and every year they suffer because of it. In the same way, it is also expensive for the individual is used for treating obesity-related diseases. You have as a citizen of a country a responsibility towards society that one does not burden the healthcare system, and that you get a job. It is undoubtedly harder to get a job if you are overweight and therefore these people may have a greater tendency to be and remain unemployed for long periods. You have the same responsibilities towards your family, namely to enter the job market and spend money on anything but medications. It is typically cheaper to prevent than to cure.
