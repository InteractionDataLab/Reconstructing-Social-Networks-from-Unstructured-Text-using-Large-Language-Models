Introduction
There is a more interesting method in balance two different population in the same environment. ----Let the majority turn into minority automatically! By using a bistable toggle switch, we create two different quorum. By designing a auto-regulative part, we build an asymmetry differentiation mechanism. We tried to prove these by both experiment and modeling.
Method
Figure 1. Genetic pathway constructed for Quorum transformation（asymmetry differentiation）
The circuit compose two parts. They can link into different vectors and co-transform into one bacteria.
Toggle switch part links LuxI(F2610) to Toggle Switch(K598002), built in vector pSB4k5 with kan+ antibiotic mark.
Regulative part links CI(C0051) to AHL signal receiver(F2620), built in pSB3C5 with cm+ antibiotic mark.
Result
Modeling shows that this model can acquire new balance, meanwhile, it is more stable and robust than an ordinary genetic toggle switch.
Experiment
Regulative part has been constructed.
Toggle switch part was constructed but sequencing show that there is deletion of core part of toggle switch, which was provided by another iGem team. And we also proved that the parts to build up toogle
We failed to build up one of device till now, so it may take more time to do the function test.
Future Work
Finish the toggle switch part and test the whole gene circuit.
Get more experimental data.
