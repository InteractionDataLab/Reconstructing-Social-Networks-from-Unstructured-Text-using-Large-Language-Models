iGEM Prizes
Best Human Practice Advance
Our effort on human practice includes not only an survey aims as the students or faculty who are interested in synthetic biology and biosafety, but also an activity of Popularization of Science as an poster show to public, including people from all the ages and careers. And the third, our human practice have designed an new gene safety guard to solve potential problems of transgene.
Best Experimental Measurement
Best Model
