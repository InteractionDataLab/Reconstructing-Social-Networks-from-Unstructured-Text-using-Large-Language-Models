Things we did this week
The new ideas for the Discovery Festival are elaborated. Some of the ladies of the team went shopping for team suits, but came home empty handed. The team shirts are handed to the press.
Mix and match.. the shopping girls liked the red suits, but unfortunately the guys refused to wear the matching red trousers. Such shame!
Progression in the lab
We wanted to test the device, but the device guys couldn't test anything without the calcium channels. The colonies with inserts from the first transformation with one part of the channels or the GECOs had been cultured over the weekend, but became useless because a lot of dead cells are mixed with living cells in the medium. We picked some new colonies to culture, so we can use them tomorrow. Since not enough YEAST NIT.BASE was in stock to make all the medium we wanted to make, we made just enough to do the transformations this week. Unfortunately, we didn’t put enough agar into the media and the plates didn’t solidify. Therefore we put more agar in the media and autoclave them again. Furthermore, we did the second transformations. So for all the yeast cells with an insert, we prepared another insert: the ones with a GECO insert got one part of the channel as new insert and the ones with one part of the channels got either a GECO insert or the other part of the channel.
Huray for the model?!
After some frustrating days we finally don't receive unknown warnings anymore. Huray! As always during modelling, these happy moments went by quickly. Suddenly the characteristics of the GECO-proteins show some strange values, including negative values.
