Update on our general tasks
A second design for the wiki, poster and presentation is created. Since it consists of more 'straight lines and logical figures' everybody (just because we are technical students) loved it! In our bare office, the list of iGEM deadlines is put up on the wall as decoration. Besides being decoration, it remembers us about what we still need to do! Furthermore, the first brainstorm session for the Discovery Festival is held and we have some great ideas for the 5000+ visitors!
Lab results
Finally, we got the first results from the fluorescent spectroscopy: the protein works! The results were exactly what we suspected. By adding more Ca2+, the fluorescence increased. The way we worked this time was different comparing the last few times. We washed the protein solution with EDTA before adding the calcium ions. This was necessary, because the protein we used came out of E. coli cells which already have Ca2+ in their cytoplasm.
Our device
Improvements to the software of the device are made. Each 17 seconds, we can display another picture! But the refresh rate is still 17 seconds...
