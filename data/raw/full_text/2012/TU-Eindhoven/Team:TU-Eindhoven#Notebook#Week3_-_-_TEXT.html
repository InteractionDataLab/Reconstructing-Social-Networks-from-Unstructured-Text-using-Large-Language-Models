Working hard
Our budget is approved by the organization, so now we can spend some money on the device, lab equipment and team shirts! Furthermore, the first design for the wiki, poster and presentation is created.
Update from the lab
We started over from scratch using the old method to get the GECOs in the yeast. We also started using another method: cloning into yeast by homologous recombination. This new method makes use of the ability of yeast to 'glue' matching pieces of DNA together. This saves us most of the hassle of the original method of molecular cloning, where we do the cutting and pasting by hand.
On the plate with 200μL of transformants, we finally got colonies! But perhaps too many this time... Therefore we made new plates with 20 μL and 2 μL of transformants. The 20 μL plates show good results, while the 2 μL plates were empty. We did colony PCR and put the useful colonies on another plate. We tested 10 colonies of each color on the gel. The results: 4 red colonies, 0 green colonies and 1 blue colony.
Nice software improvements
For each pixel of the device a single pulse train is added to the software. We are lucky to have only 16 pixels, as it required a lot of programming! The refresh rate is now fixed to 17 seconds, which is caused by the specific phases needed to separate the square waves. We are still working on this... But at least we can produce one nice image on our 'screen'!
