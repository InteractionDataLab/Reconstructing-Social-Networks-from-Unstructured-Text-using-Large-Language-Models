Welcome to the home page of the iGEM team of the Eindhoven University of Technology!
Eindhoven, the city famous for its light bulbs, is the place where the roots of Dutch television lie. We, the iGEM team of the Eindhoven University of Technology, developed an innovative piece of electro-biological  equipment which will replace your old television screen in the future! We proudly present to you...
It's a multi-colored display, in which genetically engineered yeast cells are electrically stimulated to induce a fluorescent light response and consequently function as pixels. Since calcium takes the leading part in this process, the yeast cells are engineered with fluorescent calcium sensors and extra voltage-gated calcium channels.  Please take a look around at our site! Besides all important issues with regard to our project, you can find more information about us, our outreach, our partners and of course some nice pictures! Enjoy!
