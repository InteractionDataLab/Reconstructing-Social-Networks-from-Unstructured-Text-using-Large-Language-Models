Our sponsors
First of all, we are all undergraduates, our supervisors gave us advice and feedback but did not perform any dry or wet work. We did receive lab instructions by Martijn van Rosmalen, who is a PhD at our university. He gave us instructions on how to work with yeast and gave valuable advice when some of the wet work did not go according to plan.
All wiki content was created by the team, only the template from Cambridge 2009 was used and altered.
The animation on the home page was created in cooperation with the ICMS Animation Studio.
The workshop we gave at the Discovery Festival was developed in cooperation with the following teams: Wageningen_UR, Amsterdam and Groningen. During several meetings we developed an outset for the workshop and eventually divided the three locations of the festival among the teams. The team of Amsterdam went to the location in Amsterdam, the teams of Wageningen and Groningen went to Rotterdam and we ended up in our hometown Eindhoven.
Our control device was created in cooperation with the Equipment & Prototype Center of the Eindhoven University of Technology. The design was made by our device team and the device was created by the before-mentioned center.
The GECO proteins were created by the group of Robert Campbell who kindly gave us permission to create BioBricksTM of these proteins.
The MID1/CCH1 sequence containing vectors were provided by Hidetoshi Iida.
