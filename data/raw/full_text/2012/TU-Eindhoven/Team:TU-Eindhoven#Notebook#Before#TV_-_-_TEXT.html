TV Screen
Sensational things can be done with light. An example is 'GLOW', the international forum of light in art and architecture in Eindhoven. To promote Eindhoven as 'the city of light', the iGEM team came up with the idea to make a TV screen of yeast. The basis of the TV screen will be a foil with electrodes on which the yeast will be spread. The electrodes will be controlled by software like LabVIEW. The yeast will contain three different voltage-gated calcium channels. When an electrical current is set onto the calcium channel, the calcium will be transported in the cell [7]. In the cell, the calcium will bind to a green fluorescent protein [8]. After connection, the green fluorescent protein will be activated and will send out fluorescent light. Green fluorescent proteins are available in different colors. To imitate an actual TV, the colors green, blue and red will be used in combination with the different voltage-gated calcium channels. When the calcium is released, the fluorescent light will go off.
