Wiki Freeze!!!
This week is hectic! We still had to complete the BioBricksTM and submit them to the registry. The wiki had to be finished, completely, by Wednesday! Furthermore the presentation must be finished. HELP!
Update Monday
We were just completely flabbergasted (wow, I always wanted to use that word!) when we stated our WIKI-TO-DO-LIST on the whiteboard..
Update Tuesday
Even pizza-boxes are used for scratch paper.. is this a normal iGEM symptom?
Update Wednesday
Do you remember Last Project Night [1] by iGEM Calgary 2011? When we watched this video at the start of our project we were laughing, but we didn't think it would be like that for real... until last night! LAST PROJECT NIGHT IS REAL! ;)
Last!!! Update Wednesday [4:06 AM]
It is exactly 2 hours before the deadline and we made it, with a lot of coffee and bad jokes we not only finished the wiki but also had an enjoyable evening together. I (Jody) would like to thank everybody who contributed to our iGEM project, especially my team members for making this project a real success!!! We finished before the first overload of the iGEM server.
