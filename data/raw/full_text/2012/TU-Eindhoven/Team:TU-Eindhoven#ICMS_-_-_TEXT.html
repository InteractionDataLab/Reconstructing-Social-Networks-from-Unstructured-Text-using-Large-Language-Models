Institute for Complex Molecular Systems
Mastering complexity requires a deep understanding on how matter – both natural and artificial – self-organizes into functional molecular systems. The Institute for Complex Molecular Systems (ICMS) of the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) was established in 2008 and brings together mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry and engineering to stimulate education and research in this emerging field of science. Interdisciplinarity is the core of ICMS; with the specialized input from leading specialists in different branches of science and engineering, new avenues are explored. The scientific agenda of ICMS is focused around the following topics:
Construction of functional life-like molecular systems.
Bridging the gap between natural tissue and artificial materials.
Catalysis and challenges for future sustainability.
Soft matter: formulation as a science-based technology.
Particle systems and networks: getting to grips with complex interactions.
ICMS hosts the TU/e Advanced Study Centre, an intellectual home to scientists from all over the world, hosting discussions on the theme of complexity and functioning as a breeding ground for new interdisciplinary research. Complemented by the Graduate Program Complex Molecular Systems (MSc and PhD), ICMS offers an ideal training environment for all students and scientists to prepare themselves for a future career in science and engineering in a world of increased complexity.
Animation Studio
Since the (atomic) scale and dynamic nature of the investigated systems cannot be easily captured in illustrations, the ICMS, by means of the Animation Studio, has the facility to create animations and illustrations for presentations and publications. This allows researchers to convey their ideas to fellow researchers in a convenient, yet appealing way and helps to get their research noticed in the vast amount of scientific work presented each year. The Animation Studio is responsible for the animation, which can be seen on our homepage .
