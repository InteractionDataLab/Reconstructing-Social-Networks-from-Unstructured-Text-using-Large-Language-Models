Welcome!
Synthetic biology will require a multidisciplinary, collaborative design environment in order to engineer the complex biological systems of the future. Our team will create a collection of software tools which address specific technical synthetic biology challenges while simultaneously advancing the way in which users interact with computing environments. Our software will support the scientific workflow process by supporting each step: research, brainstorming, building, test, troubleshooting, iteration, and analysis. The combination of human computer interaction, bio-design automation, and experimental design makes our effort unique in the iGEM experience and closes the loop on the design-build-test methodology.
A synthetic-biology search engine that aggregates biological -data from multiple databases for the research process.
A multi-touch large-scale interface for collaborative design and construction of complex biological constructs.
An interactive installation that illustrates core concepts of synthetic biology through playful tangible interaction.
