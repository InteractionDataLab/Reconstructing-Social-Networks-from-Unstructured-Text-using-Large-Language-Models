Kimberly Chang | Wellesley College '12
Kimberly graduated from Wellesley College last semester with a degree in Media Arts and Sciences and Japanese. She is interested in the intersection between art, media, popular culture and the potential for art to influence and connect people. In her free time, she is probably either drawing, painting or hanging out on twitter.

Kathy Liu | Wellesley College '13
Kathy is a Wellesley senior biology major.  She is interested in exploring the interactions between HCI and synthetic biology.  This summer, she focused on implementing the backend design for the MoClo planner, as well as focusing on human practices issues in the iGEM projects.  This is her second year in iGEM and the HCI lab.
Notebook
Wendy Xu | Wellesley College '13
Wendy approaches HCI from the user's perspective, with an artist's eye, and with a background in Neuroscience. She wants to define naturalistic ubiquitous interactions with technology starting with multiouch and gesture sensing platforms. Her courseload has included Advanced Video Production, Data Structures, Virtual Form: Maya, Graphic Design and New Media theory.
Notebook
Nahum Seifeselassie | MIT '13
Nahum is studying biological engineering at MIT and will be interning at the Wellesley HCI lab for the summer. He hopes to utilize his current knowledge of synthetic biology while expanding his computer science and programming skills.
Notebook
Casey Grote | Wellesley College '14
Casey is a junior, Computer Science major at Wellesley college.  Casey has been with the lab since summer 2011, and is excited about the intersection between hardware and user experience, open source computing and breaking computers.
Notebook
Linda Ding | Wellesley College '14
Linda is a junior and a Computer Science major at Wellesley College. She is interesting in how humans interact with computers, especially in the realm of holograms! If she is not found coding, she is most likely playing Ultimate Frisbee!
Notebook
Kara Lu | Wellesley College '14
Kara is a junior Biology major at Wellesley College. While she has focused on the natural sciences so far, she's very excited about branching out into Computer Science and exploring its role in multidiscipline applications.
Notebook
Nicole Francisco | Wellesley College '14
Nicole is majoring in Computer Science and Economics. She is interested in enhancing the user's experience and make the interaction between them and emerging interfaces more intuitive. She is looking forward to developing applications on new platforms.
Notebook
Veronica Lin | Wellesley College '15
Veronica is a rising sophomore at Wellesley College studying Computer Science and Economics. She enjoys CS because it is a worthwhile challenge that enhances her programming skills, creativity, and ability to collaborate with others. This is her first year working in the Human Computer Interaction Lab at Wellesley College.
