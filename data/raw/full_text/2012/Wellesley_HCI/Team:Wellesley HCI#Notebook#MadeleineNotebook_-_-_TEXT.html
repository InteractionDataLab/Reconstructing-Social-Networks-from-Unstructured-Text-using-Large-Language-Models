Madeleine's Notebook
Summer 2012
This summer in the Human Computer Interaction lab, I worked on the MoClo Planner, an interactive program for bioengineers. I worked on the early design and learned about coding a WPF user interface in XAML. Following this, my group and I worked on code for genetic alignment tests for the Primer Designer component of the MoClo Planner. With these, I learned navigation within the command line and rough knowledge of C#. I observed user studies where we watched volunteers test our program for bugs and give us feedback on the intuitiveness of the design. This summer, I gained a new appreciation for the smaller projects that go into large software and now see the importance of documenting, sharing, and improving your code.
