Attributions and Contributions
Computational team
We developed several software applications and deployed them with iGEM teams, high school students, and the local community at large. While this was a team effort, we point out key contributors to each of the applications below:
SynBio Search
SynBio Search was inspired by our participatory design sessions with the BU iGEM team, Robert Kincaid, David Olsen, and Natalie Kuldell. The application was designed by the team during our brainstorming and implemented by Linda Ding with the help of Chelsea Hoover.
MoClo Planner
The MoClo Planner was inspired by our participatory design session with the BU iGEM team, Robert Kincaid, David Olsen, and Natalie Kuldell. The application was designed by the team during our brainstorming and implemented by Kara Lu, Nahum Seifeselassie, Kathy Liu, and Casey Grote with the help of Consuelo Valdes.
Outreach: SynFlo and Peer Mentorship
SynFlo was inspired by our experience in the BioBuilder workshop conducting the E. chromi experiment, our participatory design session with the BU iGEM team, Robert Kincaid, David Olsen, and Natalie Kuldell, and research on related work. The application was designed by the Wendy Xu and Kimberly Chang and the team during our brainstorming and implemented by Nicole Francisco, Kimberly Chang, and Wendy Xu with the help of Consuelo Valdes.  In addition, the Wellesley HCI Lab mentored a rising senior in high school and presented in the Wellesley College Science Center Summer Poster Session.
The iGEM Team Wiki
The iGEM Team Wiki was designed by Kara Lu and implemented by the team.
