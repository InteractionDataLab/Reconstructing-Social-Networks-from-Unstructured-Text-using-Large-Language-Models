Have another team utilize the software developed by your team. You must clearly show how your software was used and the results that were obtained.
We worked closely with the BU and MIT iGEM teams throughout our process and tested zMol and MoClo Planner with these teams as well as with Wellesley students.
Use SBOL in your software documentation
Both SynBio Search and MoClo Planner incorporate SBOL symbols into the user interface.
Build upon existing software from a previous iGEM competition found on the The Registry of Software Tools
We utilize Eugene in the implementation of the MoClo Planner .
We also access the Registry of Biological Parts and the iGEM archives.
We draw upon G-nome Surfer Pro in the design and implementation of MoClo Planner.
Outline and detail how your software effects Human Practices in Synthetic Biology
We applied user-centered design methodology. and conducted extensive user research
We discuss safety considerations in our research.
We designed and implemented SynFlo to communicate key ideas about synthetic biology to a wider audience.
Provide a detailed, draft specification for the next version of your software tool
MoClo Planner
Synflo
SynBio Search
Provide a second, distinct (yet com plementary) software tools project.
We developed both SynBio Search , which supports the research phase of the synthetic biology workflow, and the MoClo Planner , which support specification and design of new multi-gene constructs.
Provide a demonstration of their software as a video tutorial on their wiki
MoClo Planner , Synflo , and SynBio Search video tutorials can be found on our downloads and tutorials page
Register the team, have a great summer , and have fun attending the Jamboree
Create and share a description of the team's project via the  iGEM wiki
Project Overview
Present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree
Develop and make available via the The Registry of Software Tools an open source software tool that supports synthetic biology based on BioBrick standard biological parts
All our source code can be downloaded on our downloads and tutorials page
