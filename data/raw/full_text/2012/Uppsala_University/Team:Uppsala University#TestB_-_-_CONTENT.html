<TABLE id="ctable" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD colspan="2" valign="top"><H2>Project description</H2><DIV id="desc"><P>Team Uppsala University 2012 is dedicated to combating the rising antibiotic resistance in bacteria by means of synthetic biology. Old and well-known antibiotics are quickly becoming ineffective as resistance genes are spreading. Scientist around the world struggle with varying success to develop new antibacterial substances. But do we really have to abandon classic antibiotics? Team Uppsala University begs to differ, we believe new methods will allow us to combat the resistance itself, and make the bacteria once again sensitive to old drugs.</P><P>Working with real-world resistance genes isolated from ESBL outbreaks at Swedish hospitals, we are developing anti-resistance systems active at three different levels: DNA level, transcriptional level and translational level. Our systems will be delivered to the target bacteria using an engineered phage and/or a conjugative plasmid.</P><P>At DNA level, we will develop a method for permanent removal of plasmids from bacteria. Using TAL Effector Nucleases, we will be able to target and cut individual resistance genes.</P><P>At transcriptional level, we will use synthetic super-repressors to repress transcription of resistance genes and native defense mechanisms in bacteria.</P><P>At translational level, we will construct a modular large-scale screening system for sRNA:s and use it to find strongly silencing RNA sequences against three common resistance genes.</P><P>With this team on the project, there is no question about it: <B>Resistance is futile!</B></P></DIV></TD><TD valign="top"><H2>Latest news</H2><DIV id="news"><B>September 7, 2012</B>
Today is an very important day, one of the deadlines due today is the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Uppsala_University/Safety">safety questions</A>.
<B>September 3, 2012</B>
We are honored to have Herbert Boyer <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2012/c/c5/Skand-Boyer.jpg">here with us</A> today!
<B>September 1, 2012</B>
We are anxiously waiting for <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Chalmers-Gothenburg">Team Chalmers-Gothenburg</A>, <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Copenhagen">Team Copenhagen</A> and <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SDU-Denmark">Team SDU-Denmark</A> to arrive at Uppsala. Let the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Uppsala_University/Activities#weekend">Scandinavian weekend</A> begin!
<B>August 16, 2012</B>
We keep on working hard in the lab! Some new team photos were taken during Monday and we hope to upload them by next week. We also got two new sponsors, our faculty <A href="http://teknat.uu.se/?languageId=1">TekNat</A> and <A href="http://www.analytik-jena.de/en.html">Analytik Jena</A>. Analytik Jena is a provider of instruments and products in the areas of analytical measuring technology, life science, and optoelectronics. 
<B>August 10, 2012</B>
Some smaller updates have been made recently. We received some great news today when <A href="http://www.uppsalastudentkar.se/">Uppsala student union</A> decided to sponsor us!
<B>August 3, 2012</B>
Another day lacking wiki modifications. Although the top banner is being discussed and hopefully we will reach a common ground soon. Until then, please bear with us.
<B>August 2, 2012</B>
No changes today, apart for the top banner. Conflicting opinions caused the change, but chances are it's not at its final state just yet considering how badly it is adapted to the wiki layout.
<B>August 1, 2012</B>
August kicks off with a busy day in the lab and no changes made to the wiki. Hopefully this isn't a lasting trend for this month.
<B>July 31, 2012</B>
Further attempts to improve the look of the <A href="/Team:Uppsala_University/Notebook">Notebook</A>-page. It doesn't seem quite right yet, however.
<B>July 30, 2012</B>
Another day of Webmaster laziness. Tomorrow will be better... I hope.
<B>July 29, 2012</B>
Pretty much no changes made to the wiki today – it is Sunday after all. However, plenty of work was carried out in the lab – it is Sunday after all...
<B>July 28, 2012</B><A href="/Team:Uppsala_University/Notebook">Notebook</A>-content covering the first two weeks of labwork added. Future updates will address the currently unorganized look of that specific page.
<B>July 27, 2012</B>
Started adding content in the form of subtitles on the <A href="/Team:Uppsala_University/Project">Project</A>-page. By doing this I also established the general layout of all our future pages, and this will hopefully make filling each of those pages with information a breeze.
<B>July 26, 2012</B>
Yet another icon has made its way onto the top menu! This one links to our <A href="http://www.unt.se/blogg/blogg.aspx?blogg=1784672">blog: </A>. Please observe that it's written entirely in Swedish – and should therefore serve those who wishes to polish their language skills well.
<B>July 25, 2012</B>
Very few additions to the wiki today, mainly due to a boomerang session held by our personal <A href="/Team:Uppsala_University/Team#supervisors">Crocodile Dundee</A> (Professor Forster).
<B>July 24, 2012</B>
Finally got the <A href="/Team:Uppsala_University/Team#contact">contact form</A> up and running. However, the host only allows for 20 submissions a month but hopefully that will do for now. I also altered the size of the link menu, added a Tweet-button and changed the <A href="/Team:Uppsala_University">Home</A>-button into this icon: .
<B>July 23, 2012</B>
Further tweaking of the icons in the top left corner – they are now included on the menubar, making them more accessible. I also added a Facebook icon for easy access to our page, as well as a Mail icon, which links directly to our contact form (that, unfortunately, still isn't functional...)
<B>July 22, 2012</B>
Added another button below the iGEM-logo in the top left corner for those interested in <A href="https://twitter.com/igemuppsala">following us on Twitter</A>.
<B>July 21, 2012</B>
The dust has finally settled from the party last night, and somehow the lab seems remarkably empty today... Anyway, new additions to the page include the top left iGEM-logo linking back to the <A href="/Main_Page">Main page</A> and a submenu of links on the <A href="/Team:Uppsala_University/Team">Team</A> page. Now where are those Aspirins...
<B>July 20, 2012</B>
No on-site changes today (apart from this update). However, the team is about to meet up for a barbecue in the local park – it will be awesome!
<B>July 19, 2012</B>
New top banner and further improvements on the <A href="/Team:Uppsala_University/Team">Team</A> page. A Notebook section is also planned, which will cover our weekly endeavors.
<B>July 18, 2012</B>
The finalized top banner mentioned a few days ago turned out to be nothing more than wishful thinking. An improved version is currently in the making! As for how the lab work is coming along: a discussion will be held tomorrow regarding the Notebook section of the wiki, which hopefully will describe our progress in detail. More info soon!
<B>July 17, 2012</B>
Started working on our <A href="/Team:Uppsala_University/Team">Team</A> page. Meanwhile the number of Facebook likes keep increasing - thanks a lot guys, we are eternally grateful!
<B>July 16, 2012</B>
Widened the top banner and will hopefully start adding more pages later today. On another note, a huge thanks to all of those liking us on Facebook. Overnight the total number went from 75 to 84, which is amazing!
<B>July 15, 2012</B>
Project description has been added along with a comic strip describing the general idea behind our project. We also changed the top banner, which now likely is the final version.
<B>July 14, 2012</B>
Our wiki is slowly taking form. It is being worked upon daily and once the final layout is finished we will start adding more pages. So keep checking back!PS. All teams – don't forget tomorrow is the deadline for uploading your abstracts.
