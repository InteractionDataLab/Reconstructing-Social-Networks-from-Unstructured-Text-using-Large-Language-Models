sRNA Genes Silencing | New standard backbone series | Promoter characterization | Chromoproteins | Scarless Gene Deletion
sRNA gene silencing
We have developed a modular screening system and protocol for finding silencing sRNAs against arbitrary genes. Using this, we have found strongly silencing sRNAs against a clinical antibiotic gene and lowered the minimal inhibatory concentration ten-fold in resistant bacteria.

New standard backbone series
We have constructed a range of new standard low copy backbones, and variants with built-in lacIq repression for tight control of toxic genes, thermosensitivity and FRT sites for removing resistance cassettes. This work was as it turned out that the common registry pSB4 backbones all have faulty copy number regulation, while we needed low copy backbones for out project.

Promoter characterization
We have characterized promoter strengths of eight popular promoters with Fluorescense Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), putting syntetic and wild-type promoters on the same scale.

Chromoproteins
Proteins with a visible intrinsic color are the simplest possible reporters i molecular biology. Most iGEMers are familiar with the Red Flourescent Protein (RFP), but there are many other colors available among the organisms of the world. We have characterized and submitted new chromoproteins, allowing multiplexed colorful reporters.

Scarless gene deletion
In our project we have extensivly used homology recombineering into the bacterial chromosome. To aid this work, we have built a improved Cat-SacB selection-counterselection casette, which provides  easy and reliable recombineering, and the possibility of scarless gene deletion.
