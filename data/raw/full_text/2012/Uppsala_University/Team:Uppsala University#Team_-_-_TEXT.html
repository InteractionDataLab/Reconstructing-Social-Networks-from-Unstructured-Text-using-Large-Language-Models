The team
Team Uppsala University consists of 26 (not all in picture above) eager undergraduate students from the Molecular Biotechnology Engineer program. This is the fourth year that Uppsala University is participating in iGEM. We would like to thank the Biology Education Centre (IBG), the Department of Cell and Molecular biology (ICM) and the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology (IMBIM) for providing us with resources, knowledge and tools. We would also like to thank our sponsors, supervisors, instructors and advisors for your help and support!

Anders Virtanen
Anthony Forster is a professor at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and a member of the Uppsala RNA Research Centre (URRC). He is researching synthetic biology, protein synthesis and drug discovery, and is currently working towards the synthesis of a minimal cell. Read more...
Anders Virtanen is a professor at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and a member of the Uppsala RNA Research Centre (URRC). Anders studies primarily enzymes involved in regulating the fate of mRNA. One of his goals is to identify previously unrecognized small non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) and to determine their functions.

Herbert Boyer
Herbert Boyer is one of the founding fathers of modern recombinant DNA technologies. In his famous paper from 1970, Boyer and Cohen made the first molecular cloning into a vector. This discovery laid the foundation to start one of the first biotech companies.
We are honored to have met this incredible man and to have him as a donor.
