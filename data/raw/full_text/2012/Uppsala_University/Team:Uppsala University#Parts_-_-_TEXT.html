Small RNA Scaffold
BBa_K864440 - J23101-Spot42:
This is the native spot42 small RNA constitutively expressed by BBa_J23101 and is useful as a template for generating a randomized library of small RNAs for downregulation of any gene of interest.
Reporter System
BBa_K864444 - RFP-linker-SYFP:
This part can be used to insert any 5’UTR of a gene of interest to screen for downregulation of this gene by artificial small RNAs. This reporter reporter system comes with a fluorescent marker that is downregulated by any small RNA targeting the 5'UTR of the gene of interest.
New low-copy backbone
BBa_K864001 - pSB4C15:
This is a new BioBrick standard vector with low copy pSC101 replication origin, especially usable for Lambda Red recombineering in E coli.
Blue Chromoprotein
BBa_K864401 - aeBlue:
aeBlue is a blue chromoprotein extracted from the basal disk of a beadlet anemone Actinia equina. The protein has an absorption maximum at 597nm and a deep blue colour. The protein aeBlue has significant sequence homologies with proteins in the GFP family.
