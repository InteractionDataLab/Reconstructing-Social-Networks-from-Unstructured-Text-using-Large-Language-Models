iGEM weekend | Blog
Scandinavian iGEM weekend
Back to top
Team Uppsala University  decided to invite the four other Scandinavian iGEM teams for a weekend where we could come together, learn to know each other and prepare us for the Amsterdam meeting. The iGEM teams of Chalmers University (Gothenburg), Copenhagen University, Southern Denmark University and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology  (Trondheim) were invited. With the first three of those teams attending, 35 happy iGEM:mers met in Uppsala the 1-3 of September.
The schedule for the weekend combined social and scientific activites. The teams got to present and discuss their projects, discuss iGEM issues in workgroups and listen to presentations by Uppsala syntetic biology researchers. During the monday, we had invited Herbert Boyer, the first researcher to express perform a genetic cloning in 1973 and express a synthesized gene in 1977. He also held an open seminar, with about 100 attendees from the university faculty, about the history and development of genetic engineering.

Blog
Back to top
To reach out to the public we started a blog on a local newspaper in Uppsala, our target group was the everyday person. We have written about our project and the biosynthetic community in a way which can be understood by a person who has never heard of synthetic biology before. The main goal with this blog was to inform and raise awareness of the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance and how we need find new ways of fighting it.
We have held study visit for the freshmen students of molecular biotechnology engineering program. The study was composed of two lectures, one held by our instructor Erik Gullberg, who spoke about synthetic biology, and the other one was held by our team members Sabri Jamal and Hampus Elofsson, who spoke about iGEM and the projects we have done in past years and now. The study was finalized with a short tour of our lab and some practical information about the lab work. The goal of this study was to inspire the students to join iGEM in the following years.
The molecular biotechnology engineering section of Uppsala University is going to have a inspiration week with different guest lectures during lunch. We have been invited to speak on Monday 1/10 about how iGEM is relevant to our education and what experience participation gives.
