Scandinavian iGEM weekend
Back to top
Like many other countries, we also wanted to have a regional pre-meeting. Since Sweden is a small country, we invited all Scandinavian teams to the first Scandinavian iGEM meetup, for a weeked with project presentations, lectures and a visit from Herbert Boyer. It ended with 35 happy iGEM:ers meeting during a weekend in Uppsala. Read more...
Parts sent to other teams
Back to top
The 2011 Uppsala team made some BioBrick parts that are very popular, but were not included in the 2012 kit. Work has continued on the chromoproteins this year. They have been sent to and further characterized by a number of other teams around the world.
Groningen
Team Groningen from the Netherlands is constructing the "Food Warden", a  project to get a visible output from Bacillus subtilis when rotten meat volatiles are present.  The recieved the amilCP (blue) and amilGFP (yellow) chromoproteins, and implemented them in B subtilis with wonderful results !
Columbia-Cooper
Team Columbia-Cooper in New York develops a method of etching circuit boards using bacteria. For this, the blue light sensor FixJ had potential to be very useful. They also requested the amilCP (blue) and amilGFP (yellow) chromoproteins, which we happily provided as agar stabs.
Copenhagen
Team Copenhagen works on darkness-induced bioluminescence in the cyanobacteria Synecococcus. They had use of our green light sensor, CcaR and CcaS, to control light expression. Team Copenhagen also participated in the Scandinavian iGEM meetup .
Paris-Saclay
Team Paris-Saclay works on tuning expression by temperature, and had use of a directly visible reporter. They were also sent the amilCP (blue) and amilGFP (yellow) chromoproteins.
Valencia
Team Valencia were interested our blue light sensor FixJ, and was sent agar stabs with the different BioBricks that make up the sensor. However, the envelope got into a mail system limbo, and took 5 weeks to travel though Europe before it arrived in Spain.
