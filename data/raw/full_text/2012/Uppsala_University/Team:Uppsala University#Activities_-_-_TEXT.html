iGEM weekend | Blog
Scaninavian iGEM weekend
Back to top
Team Uppsala University  decided to invite the four other Scandinavian iGEM teams for a weekend where we could come together, learn to know each other and prepare us for the Amsterdam meeting. The iGEM teams of Chalmers University (Gothenburg), Copenhagen University, Southern Denmark University and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology  (Trondheim) were invited. With the first three of those teams attending, 35 happy iGEM:mers met in Uppsala the 1-3 of September.
The schedule for the weekend combined social and scientific activites. The teams got to present and discuss their projects, discuss iGEM issues in workgroups and listen to presentations by Uppsala syntetic biology researchers. During the monday, we had invited Herbert Boyer, the first researcher to express perform a genetic cloning in 1973 and express a synthesized gene in 1977. He also held an open seminar, with about 100 attendees from the university faculty, about the history and development of genetic engineering.
