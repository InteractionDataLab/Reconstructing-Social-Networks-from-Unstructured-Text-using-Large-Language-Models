All work described on this wiki was done by ourselves. We managed the whole project, from planning to financing and the complete lab work by ourselves. Nevertheless we could not have done all this work without the help, advice and guidance of several people.
The wet-lab work was supervised by Erik Gullberg and Mikael Nissbeck. Erik Gullberg also showed us how to operate the flow cytometer / cell sorter (FACS), and how to do and analyze Etests.
We received biobrick plasmids and strains carrying F plasmids containing the clinical resistance genes from Erik Gullberg. We got advice and help with the modelling of RNA structures from Erik Holmqvist and Mikael Nissbeck. Hervé Nicoloff advised us on how to make large randomized libraries.
Thanks for all your help with our project!
