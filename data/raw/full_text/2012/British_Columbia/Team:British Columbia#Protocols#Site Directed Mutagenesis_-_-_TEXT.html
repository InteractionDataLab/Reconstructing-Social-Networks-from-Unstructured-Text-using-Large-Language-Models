Site-Directed Mutagenesis with BioRAD iPROOF PCR kit
This protocol closely follows the Stratagene QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit, but uses the enzymes and buffers from the BioRAD iPROOF PCR kit.
1. Prepare the reaction mixtures:
Per 50 µL PCR reaction:
dNTP
4 µL
iProof HF Buffer
10 µL
MgCl2
1.5 µL
Primer, each
? µL (125 ng)
dsDNA template
? µL (5-50 ng)
iProof enzyme
0.5 µL
dH2O
to 50 µL
I would suggest trying 5 ng of dsDNA template, as I had the highest mutation success rate at this concentration.  This observation, however, has not been confirmed and is more anecdotal
2. Thermocycle the reaction according to the standard iPROOF cycling conditions, adjusting the extension time (X:XX) for the expected product length.
1.
Hot start
98ºC
1:00
2.
Denaturation
98ºC
0:10
3.
Anneal
55ºC
0:30
4.
Extension
72ºC
X:XX
5.
GOTO 2 for 12-18 cycles
The QuikChange protocol suggests the following number of cycles
Type of mutation
Number of cycles
Point mutations
12
Single amino acid changes
16
Multiple amino acid deletions or insertions
18
3. Check for amplification on agarose gel
I have had positive transformations even without positive band, so it's worth a shot to transform the product regardless of the outcome.
4. Perform DpnI digestion of amplification products to digest the parental DNA (CRITICAL!!!)
5. Add 10 U of DpnI to each reaction and incubate at 37 ºC
6. Transform 1 µL of PCR product.  I did not do any PCR purification before this step
