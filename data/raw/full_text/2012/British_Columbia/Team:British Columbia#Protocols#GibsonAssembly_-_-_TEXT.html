Gibson Assembly Protocol
This protocol closely follows the suggested protocol in the NEB Gibson Assembly guidebook.
Using purified DNA, add 50-100ng plasmid and 2-3X molar concentration of the inserts, or 5X molar concentration if using inserts of 200 bp or less. Add dH2O up to 10 uL. Set up a positive control using 10uL Gibson Assembly Positive Control.
Add 10 uL Gibson Assembly Master Mix to each product.
Incubate at 50°C for 1 hour.
Using 2uL product, transform into competent cells. Since the Gibson Assembly Master Mix contains PEG, avoid using PEG sensitive competent cells. The provided positive control results in an amp-resistant plasmid.
