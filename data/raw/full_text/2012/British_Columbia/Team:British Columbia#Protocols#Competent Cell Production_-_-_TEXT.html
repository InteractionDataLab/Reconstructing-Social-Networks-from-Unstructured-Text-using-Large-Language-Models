Competent Cell Production
Day 1
Streak out frozen glycerol stock of bacterial cells (Top 10, DH5α, etc.) onto an LB plate without antibiotics.
Grow plate overnight at 37°C.
Day 2
Autoclave:
2 L of ddH2O
100 mL of 10% v/v glycerol (molecular biology grade)
1 L of LB (or preferred media)
4 centrifuge bottles and caps
lots of microfuge tubes
Chill overnight at 4°C:
ddH2O
10% glycerol
centrifuge rotor
Prepare starter culture of cells.
Select a single colony of E. coli from fresh LB plate and inoculate a 10 mL starter culture of LB (or preferred media).
Grow culture at 37°C in shaker overnight.
Possible media substitutes include SOB, 2xYT, etc.
All glassware should be detergent-free, as trace detergent residue reduces competency.
Day 3
Inoculate 1 L of LB media with 10 mL starter culture and grow in a 37°C shaker. Measure the OD600 every hour, then every 15 - 20 minutes when the OD gets above 0.2.
When the OD600 reaches 0.35 - 0.4, immediately put the cells on ice. Chill the culture for 20 - 30 minutes, swirling occasionally to ensure even cooling. Place centrifuge bottles on ice at this time.
It is important not to let the OD get any higher than 0.4. It usually takes about 3 hours to reach an OD of 0.35 when using a 10 mL starter culture.
It is also very important to keep the cells at 4°C for the remainder of the procedure. The cells, and any bottles or solutions that they come into contact with, must be pre-chilled to 4°C.
(SPIN #1) Split the 1 L culture into four parts by pouring about 250 mL into ice-cold centrifuge bottles. Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000g (~2400 rpm in the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 20 minutes at 4°C.
Decant the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 200 mL of ice-cold ddH2O.
(SPIN #2) Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000g (~2400 rpm in the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 20 minutes at 4°C.
Decant the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 100 mL of ice-cold ddH2O.
(SPIN #3) Combine resuspensions into 2 centrifuge bottles (so each contains about 200 mL of cell suspension). Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000g (~2400 rpm in the Beckman JA-10 rotor) for 20 minutes at 4°C. At this step, rinse two 50 mL conical tubes with ddH2O and chill on ice.
Decant the supernatant and resuspend each pellet in 40 mL of ice-cold 10% glycerol. Transfer each suspension to a 50 mL conical tube.
Harvest the cells by centrifugation at 1000g (~2100 rpm in the Beckman GH-3.8 rotor) for 20 minutes at 4°C. Start putting 1.5 mL microfuge tubes on ice if not already chilled.
Carefully aspirate the supernatant with a sterile Pasteur pipette (pellets lose adherence in 10% glycerol). Resuspend each pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold 10% glycerol by gently swirling. The final OD600 of the resuspended cells should be ~ 200 - 250.
Aliquot into sterile 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and snap freeze with liquid nitrogen. Store frozen cells in the -80°C freezer.
