Field trip to Chevron Burnaby site!
Sept 15-16
Traveling to Edmonton for aGEM!
Our team attended the Alberta Genetically Engineered Machines (aGEM) competition alongside the 2012 University of Alberta, University of Calgary and Lethbridge University iGEM teams. aGEM consisted of a jamboree-style presentation by each team and feedback from a judging panel. We obtained a lot of constructive advice from the panel regarding our presentation. Overall, the judges found our project to be very exciting and applicable industrially, and thought that we needed to present our story more coherently and confidently! We are looking forward to meeting with the teams from Alberta again at the West Americas regionals and hopefully the Worlds Championship.
