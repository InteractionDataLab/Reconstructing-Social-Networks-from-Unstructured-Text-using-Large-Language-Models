A Genetic Toggle Switch Using Recombinases
Team Michigan is engineering a novel, tightly controlled and inducible protein expression system in Escherichia coli in order to demonstrate that we can create robust boolean genetic control circuits that do not continuously rely on the presence of signaling compounds. We are using two unidirectional recombinases found in pathogenic Escherichia coli, HbiF and FimE, to manipulate promoter orientation.
