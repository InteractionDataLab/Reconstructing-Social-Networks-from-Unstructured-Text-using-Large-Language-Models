Models made by Thomas Holst-Hansen
We would like to give a lot of credit to Thomas for the hard work he had put into this job.
And also if you like this model it is possible to download it by clicking on the download function in the viewer.
Here are the Matlab files Thomas used for the model
These files were original .m files to mathlab but are converted to txt with Notepad.
If you feel like using them, just rename them to .m files.
