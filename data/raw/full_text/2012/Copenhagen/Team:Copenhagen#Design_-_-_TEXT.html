BIOLOGICAL NEON - makes urban neon light sustainable
Light without electricity
We are all familiar with the neon signs illuminating the streets of cities all over the world. Neon signs are advertising for small shops, brands and companies everywhere. We have all seen parks with fountains beautifully lit up at night and everyone has come across architectural buildings with facades illuminated by light.  Imagine a cityscape where every neon sign and every illuminated fountain and facade is CO2 neutral and does not use electricity. This can come true with the new biological neon - a sustainable solution that lives and transforms CO2 into light and oxygen.
What is biological neon?
Biological neon is a cyanobacteria, called Cyanodelux, which emits light when it is dark. Cyanodelux only needs salt water, air, sunlight, and CO2 to produce light when it is dark. As a bonus it also produces oxygen and will improve the air in the city. Cyanodelux bacteria are kept alive in an aquarium-like environment. Cyanodelux performs the natural process of photosynthesis and does not use any electricity to produce light when it is dark. Cyanodelux recharges every day by being in the sunlight and gets ready to emit light when it is dark enough. Cyanodelux is only turned on when needed because it has a natural internal switch. It will therefore only produce light when it is actually needed.
What to use biological neon for?
Biological neon has many commercial applications and can perform in urban settings as a sustainable alternative to light from electricity. This is demanded in a time where we have to think of innovative ways to use the resources of the earth. The use of biological neon will truly bring down the energy consumption in the city. The concept of biological neon can be used as a platform to think innovatively about the way we use light and electricity in urban settings.
Concept 1#: Commercial & company neon signs
The sustainable concept:
Neon signs are very energy consuming and are often turned on 24 hours a day. Instead of using electricity we suggest that neon signs are illuminated by biological neon.  By using and implementing this type of biological sign companies can appear environmentally responsible by choosing a solution that is sustainable. This will benefit the company profiles as well as the environment.
How?:
These new biological neon signs will consist of an aquarium containing salt water and Cyanodelux. During the day one will be able to see the bacteria inside the aquarium. The bacteria have an olive-green color. Depending on the location of the sign it can work as an information pole where by passers can learn about Cyanodelux, photosynthesis, or other sustainable solutions created by the firm. It will be interesting to look at, even when it is turned off. If it is situated on a building it will just look like a normal sign.  The aquarium that will constitute the neon sign and in which the cyanobacteria live is very similar to a normal aquarium and will work in much the same way; it will have an air pump that will provide an aerated environment for the bacteria. The air pumped into the water will come from the surroundings. The aquarium-neon-sign should of course be placed so it is exposed to sunlight.
Safety & Maintenance:
We will have to be careful that these light-emitting cyanobacteria do not get mixed up with natural cyanobacteria. They must not get access to and evolve in nature or get near the drain system in the city. The aquarium-like environment has to be maintained every 3-6 months, depending on size and temperature (growth of the bacteria).  The maintenance will be done by a professional technician and aquarium cleaner who will look after the algae and clean the aquarium, if needed.   The aquarium will have a pumping system that will oxidize the water. The pump system will be run by solar power, from solar cells, that will be neatly situated beside the aquarium or any place where it is suitable.  To ensure safety, the only way to get in contact with the salt water with the Cyanodelux is through two pipes; one for the air pump (ensured by a valve) and one for exchanging the water. Only a trained technician can open and exchange the water.   The bacteria will be in a controlled aquarium. There will be a safety system. If the glass of the aquarium is broken a DNA destructive fluid will mix with the cyanobacteria and kill them.

Here we have shown some examples of where the biological neon=cyanodelux aquarium can replace existing light sources.

OTHER CONCEPTS AND PERSPECTIVES:
#2 – Illuminated fountains, sculptural elements & information poles
The sustainable and social concept(s):
At social spots, in parks, and in the streets fountains and other sculptural elements are often beautifully illuminated. But they appear less beautiful when thinking about how energy consuming they are. We can keep these elements and even make them sustainable. With Cyanodelux, we can keep having the city illuminated in the dark. It makes the city cozy and helps to create social meeting places around in the city, as parks and open areas are where people like to gather. Like fountains and sculptural elements, we can also have sustainable information poles.
How?:
These fountains, sculptural elements & information poles will work the same way as concept #1, and Cyanodelux will perform and live in a special aquarium.
Safety & Maintenance:
Since Cyanodelux will live in an aquarium, the safety and maintenance procedures are the same as for the previous suggestion/concept/idea.
Examples:
Here we have shown some examples of where the biological neon=cyanodelux aquarium can replace existing light sources.
Picture left : The Cyanodelux aquarium will be situated underneath the fountain.
Picture in the middle : The Cyanodelux aquarium can have various sculptural forms for a fountain.
Picture right : The Cyanodelux aquarium can have various sculptural forms.
#3 – Illuminated architectural facades on buildings.
The sustainable concepts:
Buildings, and especially newly born buildings, will often have illuminated energy consuming facades. These facades can be replaced by the Cyanodelux aquarium. This will make the buildings and the cityscape more sustainable.
How?:
Illuminated architectural facades on buildings will work the same way as concept #1 and Cyanodelux will perform and live in a special aquarium.
Safety & Maintenance:
Since the Cyanodelux will live in an aquarium, the safety and maintenance procedures are the same as for the previous suggestion/concept/idea.
Examples:
Here we have shown some examples of where the biological neon=cyanodelux aquarium can replace existing light sources for facades.
Pictures: The Cyanodelux aquarium can have various forms and can be integrated into architectural buildings.
PERSPECTIVES:
The possibilities of using biological neon are endless. The above suggestions are just a start. Cyanodelux provides light without electricity. It only needs salt water, air, sunlight and CO2, which makes it a sustainable and innovative alternative to current light sources. Especially in a urban setting, where neon light is everywhere, it will be able to bring down the energy consumption – a great advantage of both the local and global environment. Biological neon provided by Cyanodelux can help us to think beyond our current way of using the scarce resources of the earth.
