Team presentation
iGEM Copenhagen2012 is the second team to participate in iGEM. The team is divided into those who work in the laboratory and the external members that work with the project from different fields of study. The team was started around February 2012 and the external members joined in the beginning of the summer. During the spring a lot of brainstorming was done to find the perfect project, and in the beginning of July we started the lab work. Of course gaining good results is the prime goal, but having a fun and educational summer with the team is equally important.
