Welcome to Team Copenhagen 2012!!
In this years project we will produce a construct that allows cyanobacteria to emit light when exposed to darkness for an extended period of time. The advantage of using cyanobacteria over other model organisms, such as E. coli, is that cyanobacteria do not require glucose for growth, but fixate CO2 in the atmosphere.   Promoters that are normally controlling genes involved in the circadian rhythm of cyanobacteria will, in our construct, be associated with a luciferase gene casette containing all the enzymes necessary for the deployment of biologically generated light.  The result is a sustainable system in which cyanobacteria per day will synthesize the components necessary for the production of light during periods with light and consume them in darkness under emission of light.
