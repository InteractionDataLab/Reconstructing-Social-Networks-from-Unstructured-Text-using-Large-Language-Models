Hello everyone! I am Zoe. I love to swim and drawing pictures.I am happy to join in this iGEM group. Many things I have learned from the process. It is truely a good experience to me forever. Zoe is the head of experiment group 1 which are responsible for assembling the first half circuits of our i-butanol-producing enzymes. She is the chief designer of our animation.
Hsieh, Hsin-Yun
Hello, She's Lisa Hsieh. She enjoys the process of the experiment with teammates. She likes to draw pictures. With a little perfectionism, it took her 2 days to finish team's mascot. She especially likes to drink a cup of hot cocoa after a long day work, and she believes cocoa can cure all diseases! Lisa worked with Zoe and Pearl to construct PSB II + ilvC and Ptet + B0032 + Gli1. She is the designer of our cute robot mascot.
Yu, Chun-Wei
Chun-Wei is a 3rd year biotechnology student at NCTU, love nature and playing guitar also love biology. He joined iGEM to get involved in the world-changing field of synthetic biology. Together with Jenny, Chun-Wei assembled the first two part of our enzyme series, and did the tolerance experiment. He is also an important role in our Human practice who trained students to be our human practice staffs.
