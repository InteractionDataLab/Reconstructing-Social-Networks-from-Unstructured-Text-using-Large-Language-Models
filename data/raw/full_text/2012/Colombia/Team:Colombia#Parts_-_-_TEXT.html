Ralstonia:
pchS: It encodes a histidine kinase sensor of a two-component signal transduction system. Responds to threshold concentrations of the Quorum Sensing unusual signal 3-OH PAME.
pchR: Receptor of a two-component signal transduction system. Responds to threshold concentrations of the Quorum Sensing unusual signal 3-OH PAME. It is an atypical response regulator that has a histidine kinase as its output domain. Autophosphorilation after 3OH-PAME recognition may have en effect in phcA activation.
pchA:LysR-type transcriptional regulator that controls expression of many genes and is induced in a density manner, relying on the unusual Quorum Sensing signal 3OH-PAME.
PxpsR: Promoter region of xpsR (PxpsR) wich integrates different signals including phcA. Expression of genes regulated by XpsR may be correlated with threshold concentrations of 3 OH-PAME.
PxpsR-eYFP: Fluorescent Reporter to asses the response of PxpsR to different concentrations of 3OH-PAME.
Aliivibrio fischeri
The overall model can be seen in figures in the main page of Aliivibrio/Streptomyces.
chiP: Chitoporin is a specific channel that allows N-acetylglucosamine dimers to cross the outer membrane to the periplasmic space,
chiA: Chitinase is an hydrolase that cleaves the glycosidic bonds on the chitin polymer.
chiS: The histidine-kinase sensor is part of a two-component signalling system, that activates a promoter, in this case pChitin.
cbp: Chitin-binding protein is able to bind the N-acetyl glucosamine dimers in the periplasmic space. The complex CBP+(GlcNAc)2 serves as an activator of the signalling from chiS to the promoter.
PChitin: This 100bp region upstream of chiP is thought to be activated by the activation of chiS.
