The Team
Our team is comprised by students from the biological sciences, chemical and biomedical engineering, physics, and mathematics departments at the Universidad de Los Andes at Bogotá, Colombia.
Undergrads
Daniel Giraldo
Daniel is an undergraduate Chemistry and Chemical Engineering double major senior at Universidad de los Andes. Although he decided to study Chemistry, he has always had an interest for science and is always eager to learn about other fields. He is very interested in learning more about organic chemistry applied to biological systems, which is why iGem is the perfect opportunity for him to explore a little bit into microbiology and synthetic biology. His very passionate about research and working at the lab. Currently he is working in the Ralstonia group at iGem Colombia.
Daniela Olivera
Daniela is an undergraduate student in Chemical engineering and Microbiology at the Universidad de los Andes. She is interested in bioinformatic and biomedical engineering research. Currenly, she is one of the outstanding students in chemical engineering department and there are too many proffesors that wants her in their research groups. She loves to spend her little free time playing with her cat (named Anastasia), working on iGEM with her lucky friends, going to cinema and burning calories in the gym.
David A. Ayala-Usma
David is an undergraduate senior of Biology and Microbiology that, one day, simply was in the right place to get involved with iGEM and Synthetic Biology. He likes Molecular Cell Biology, Paleoecology, Geosciences, Astronomy, and some other science stuff. Also, he loves reading all kinds of tales and stories for children (like him), eating desserts, looking at the sky, taking pictures, playing at the PC, sleeping a lot, and talking, and talking, and talking... xD
He expects to eventually become a Ph.D. in Cell Biology, Earth Sciences, both or something in between, just to make a life and a living out of his passions, his favorite molecules, and discovering new exciting things. He also likes to be in contact with people around the world, and invites people with his same interests to add him on Twitter or Facebook .
Juanita Lara
Juanita is a biology and physics undergraduate student. She is very passionate about science and unveiling the mechanisms underlying biological systems is what she wants to do in life. For that reason she joined the Biophysics Group at Universidad de Los Andes, and is currently working on the characterization of thermosensors in Bacillus subtilis using molecular biology techniques and biophysical approaches. She sees in iGEM a great opportunity to meet new people and have the chance to learn from them.
Laura Rodriguez
Laura is an undergraduate student in Chemistry and Microbiology at Universidad de los Andes. She is passionate about science, likes organic chemistry and loves bacteria! She is also curious and a realll hard worker.  For her, iGEM has been an opportunity to learn, practice lab skills and making good friends! Currently she is working in the Ralstonia group at iGEM Colombia. She is really excited to meet people involved in science from another countries, this will give her a perspective of science outside her country and will also be a cultural enriching experience.
Javier E. Vargas
Javier already finished his thesis for the B.Sc. in Microbiology, but also is currently a senior student of Design at the Universidad de Los Andes. During his Microbiology thesis, he worked with the S-layer protein of Lysinibacillus sphaericus applied to bioremediation of chromium using an immobilization matrix to improve the protein stability.  In general, He is interested in molecular biology, synthetic biology, experience design and design of narratives. Also, he practices soft combat, fencing, climbing and enjoys painting (a lot).
iGEM is a great opportunity to apply his knowledge and creative instinct to demonstrate him self their capacities, gaining more lab experience while doing what he likes the most.
David Alejandro García
David is pursuing a degree in physics and mathematics as a member of the University of the Andes` class of 2014. David decided to participate in iGEM because he felt it would be an excellent opportunity to understand and manipulate the brick of the life to solve a big spectrum of problems. Outside the lab, David spends his free time playing the piano, reading some philosophy and literature, swimming. David also participates in a wide variety of academic activities such as in the “problem clinic” where he helps other students to solve difficulties in the resolution of problems in physics and being a prefect in a class of nanotechnology. After graduation, he wants to pursue a PhD in theoretical physics or nanotechnology
César Augusto Quintana
Cesar was born in Popayan (Cauca), he is a Physics and mathematics undergraduate student at the “Universidad de los Andes”. He began participating in this project because of an enormous interest in life systems founding along this time a crescent fascination about the theme. Beside science he likes a lot to play the acoustic guitar and watch movies.
Luis Alberto Gutiérrez López
Luis is an undergraduate Physics student at the Universidad de los Andes. Since his school years he’s been interested in science, deeply fascinated by the way our Universe works and particularly by the mechanisms of life. His interest in biology led him to explore other fields like physics. This passion for science and knowledge made him a very devoted student which enabled him to be awarded as Best High School Graduate of Colombia in 2011.
Besides his enthusiasm for study, he loves physical activity, especially swimming and jogging. He also enjoys literature.
He decided to join iGEM because he considers it an excellent opportunity to become familiar with research and learn many useful things about molecular biology, mathematics and programming.
Roberto Moran Tovar
Roberto is a second year undergraduate Physics and Mathematics student at Los Andes University. He loves physics since he was at high school and thinks that the science ( specially physics) is the most amazing thing that could exist. Recently, he has been interested in the study of life, evolution and in general the whole biology. He thinks his best quality is the curiosity because lets him to explore the universe in a very funny way! He is a good soccer player, likes to play video games and likes good Rock&Roll.
Diana Wilches
Diana is a B.Sc in Biology and a last year Microbiology undergraduate student of the Universidad de los Andes. She is highly interested in Environmental Science and Biotechnology, mainly in the development of strategies and alternatives that could allow to reduce the impact of the human being in the world. With this aim, she has worked in biological control of insects, bioremediation and with this iGEM project she wants to help in the development of new alternatives to the use of chemicals products in agriculture. Furthermore, Diana is passionate for traveling, old history, languages and cultural exchange.
Gabriel Martínez-Gálvez
Gabriel is a B.Sc. in microbiology and last year student in biomedical engineering (minor in physics). He is also a gamer to the bone, and a heavy soccer and basketball fan. Since high school he found it fascinating and exciting to think about programming cells into living bio-robots automated to perform specific actions inside the human body. For that matter he found systems biology and synthetic biology to be his main motivations for his studies and graduation thesis with the Biophysics Lab at the Universidad de los Andes .
He is very interested in the design of new biological processes through synthetic biology, dendritic cell information integration towards specific immune response coordination in humans as well as molecular psychology for a better understanding of emotions and aging phenomena. Feel free to follow him on twitter or challenge him in PSN (PSN ID: ksk_89)!
Diana Sanchez
Diana is a design student with emphasis on communication design and textile design. She has high interest in the dialogue between arts and science. Especially in biodesign, perception, interaction design, and art direction. Her projects focus on the boundaries between the biological and the technological and how this changes our perception. She has also worked as a Field Researcher at future trends in the Observatorio de Tendencias de la Cámara de Comercio de Bogotá and Future Concept Lab  Milan. She is interested in how science can bring metaphores and processes to design manifestations that allow us to experience the world in a more significant way.
Luz Alba Gallo
Luz is a last year Design student. Her focus is on social innovation and strategy. In the last year she had the opportunity to work on a project named "Let's meet your baby!" that was related with maternal health in low income communities.
