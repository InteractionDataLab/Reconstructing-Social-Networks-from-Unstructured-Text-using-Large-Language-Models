1.We would like to thank iGEM Colombia Team 2011*. Their original idea of sensing a fungal plant pathogen through a system of two transgenic bacterial variants is extended our the actual project, facilitating and improving key aspects of part design and modeling. Their experience contributed not only with concepts and strategies, but also by aiding to prevent and/or address several issues and pitfalls we have come across in the development of our work. We want to briefly mention some aspects that makes our project different from the 2011's. The idea to use genetically modified bacteria to detect pathogen molecules in an early stage of pathogen invasion is maintained this year, however, no parts from the previous project were used in this year project. iGEM Colombia team 2011 aimed to detect coffee rust fungus Hemileia vastatrix only. This year's team extends the idea of pathogen detection to detect also a bacterial pathogen, Ralstonia solanacearum, which is a vascular pathogen of tomato Solanum lycopersicum and potato Solanum tuberosum, as well as other crop plants. Another key feature introduced this year is the toxin-antitoxin modules which will be used to control the bacterial population density, prevent horizontal gene transfer and plasmid curing (in an antibiotic free strategy).
