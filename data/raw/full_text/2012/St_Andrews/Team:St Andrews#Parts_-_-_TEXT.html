Biobricks
St Andrews iGEM ’12 has successfully produced eight BioBricks.
Five of these BioBricks are fully characterised and functional. Three of these characterised BioBricks recreate the ω-3 synthesis pathway, and two more part prove that small metal binding peptides can be successfully tagged onto the end of GST, affording a protein that can bind metal at both ends. The BioBricks that remain to be characterised are involved in the scavenging of both precious and toxic metals from the environment.
