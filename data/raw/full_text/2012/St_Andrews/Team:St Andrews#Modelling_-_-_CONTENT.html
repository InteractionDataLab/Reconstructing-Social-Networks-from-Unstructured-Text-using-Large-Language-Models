Indeed, realizing Team St Andrews' alternative production of omega-3 could be the measure necessary to save our seas.

The success of our model and its ability to forecast the future relied on the careful definition of some parameter values. In particular, we performed parameter “tuning”: we took real world data and altered the values of the parameters in our equation, until our model’s predictions and our data resembled one another.  Being able to precisely predict past biomass values ensured that we had some grounding for making future estimates.</P><P>Unfortunately the global fish biomass data, the cornerstone of the tuning process, was not something which was readily available.  A “total fish biomass” time series did not, to our knowledge, exist. We had to distill it from existing lower-level data ourselves.</P><H2>RAM database</H2><P>After further investigation, we found that there were some cases in which biomass data was available for specific species in specific regions (this data being produced mostly for the sake of commercial stock assessment). RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database is a “compilation of stock assessment results for commercially exploited marine populations from around the world”. We believe that it is the most complete compilation of Stock Assessment Results to this date. Another advantage of the RAM Database, compared to other databases (NOAA, ICES, etc.), is that it combines data from different regional agencies, thus ensuring good global coverage. Ultimately, the RAM Database includes data from all sources known to us; therefore we decided to use it for our further work.</P><UL class="thumbnails"><LI class="span6"><A href="#ram-map" class="thumbnail" data-toggle="modal"><H3>RAM Database coverage</H3><P>Map from (Ricard et al., 2011)</P></A></LI></UL></DIV><DIV class="span6"><H2>Data manipulation</H2><P>The data presented in RAM, in some cases, was not homogeneous. For example, the Spawning Stock Biomass (total mass of fish that have reached breeding age and the data figure we were interested in) was often presented in different measures. These measures ranged from mass in tonnes/kg, weight in pounds, to the biomass of the annually produced eggs and other unspecified measures. We had to omit the datasets which were not directly convertible to tonnes.</P><H2>Calculating total fish biomass</H2><DIV id="myCarousel" class="carousel slide"><DIV class="carousel-inner"><DIV class="active item"><P><SPAN class="label label-info">Chart: All datasets prior to any manipulations</SPAN></P><DIV class="carousel-caption"><H4><SPAN class="badge badge">1/5</SPAN> Choosing boundaries for the datasets</H4><P>The next step was to “combine” the individual species-specific time series into one, which would become our biomass data.</P><P>The time period coverage offered by different datasets varied significantly.  Some datasets included biomass data from 1874 to 2005; while others gave information for the years 1990 to 2006.</P><P>FAO provided fish catch data from 1950, hence it was possible for us to run our model only from this date onwards.  However, it was important that we could compare model predictions with ‘real’ data for as many years as possible, before we could use our model to predict future results.  We, thus, chose 1950 as the baseline of our equation.  The nature of our model, as a delay differential equation, meant that we had to have biomass data for 1-4 years (the average time for a fish to reach maturity) before 1950.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="item"><P><SPAN class="label label-info">Chart: Datasets spanning different time periods</SPAN></P><DIV class="carousel-caption"><H4><SPAN class="badge badge">2/5</SPAN> Extrapolating datasets between 1932 and 2006 </H4><P>The number of datasets present at 1932 was approximately the same as at 1945.

For the datasets requiring extrapolation, we assumed that the population of the species described by these datasets varied between 1932 and the first year of the dataset in a proportional way to the way in which the sum of the biomass of the standard sets varied during that time period.  It is for this reason that it was extremely important, when searching for datasets, that we included as many as possible in our “Standard Sets” and our Standard Sets described species from many different temperate zones.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV class="item"><P><SPAN class="label label-info">Chart: Extrapolated datasets</SPAN></P><DIV class="carousel-caption"><H4><SPAN class="badge badge">4/5</SPAN> Combining the datasets</H4><P>Once the charts were extrapolated from 1932 to 2006, we had 234 individual data sets.

Very often, these assumptions can be expressed in a mathematical format.   The mathematical format is often referred to as a &quot;mathematical model&quot; of the physical situation.  Hence, as we sought to answer our own questions, we produced a mathematical model that predicted the population of world fish biomass at various times.  Our model involved parameter values which could be changed to enable us to ask different questions of the same model. </P></DIV><DIV class="span6"><H2>Why wet biomass?</H2><P>Our model measured the total fish population at a specific time, in terms of the fish biomass present in our oceans at that time; and not in terms of total number of fish.

Therefore, we avoided unnecessary conversions and errors.</LI><LI>More importantly, we modelled total fish populations with the aim of investigating their sustainability.

We would have had to model the population dynamics of multiple weight classes of fish, as well as the interaction between the weight classes. Instead, we chose to investigate adult (mature) fish biomass as we could assume, to a first approximation, that the biomass of an adult fish is constant throughout time (as suggested by Von Bertalanffy's fish growth model).

We could then use the tuned differential equation to make well grounded future biomass estimates.</P><H2>Data collection and initial values for parameters</H2><P>We located values for the recruitment rate (r), the mass of an adult fish (w), the time for a fish to reach maturity ($\tau$) and the omega-3 content of a fish, for the 18 most abundant fish species by biomass (according to RAM Legacy Database.  Taken together, these species comprise 83% of the fish biomass we could gain information about).  Weighted averages provided estimates for these parameters in the general setting, where the parameters relate to all fish species.  The range of uncertainty in a general setting parameter estimate was found by comparing the values for the 18 most abundant species and locating the greatest and smallest values.</P><P>We obtained values for the Fishing Mortality Rate (Catch/Biomass) throughout time using catch data from FAO (FAO, 2010) and our total fish biomass data obtained previously.</P><P>Our initial estimates and uncertainty ranges for the Natural Mortality Rates (adult and junior fish values), and for the Carrying Capacity (k) were somewhat arbitrary.  These parameters cannot be readily measured in the physical world.  We chose to use values for the Natural Mortality Rates that have been widely used by fish population ecological modellers in the past.  As we anticipated that fish populations would not be so large that competition for resources would be significant, we set an initial estimate for k that was ten times greater than the biomass present at 1950.</P><H2>Tuning and refining our model</H2><P>We sought to refine our parameters until the model’s predictions and our biomass data agreed well between 1950 and 2006, at least qualitatively.

It was clear that our model was failing to take into account some vital factor influencing total fish population dynamics.  Due to the fact that the biomass data seemed to be broken into two halves - between 1950 and ~1980, biomass seemed to decrease almost linearly; after 1980 it started to level off - we proposed that the missing factor was death prior to 1978 of junior fish due to fishing and the subsequent reduction in this death due to changes in international legislation.  (In 1978, an international agreement on mesh net sizes (Burd,1978) was reached and this had the effect of significantly reducing junior death, and doing so almost immediately).  We, thus, amended our differential equation and our model took its final form:</P><P>$$\frac{dB}{dt}=r w e^{-(\delta_J +FJ(t)) \tau}(1-\frac{B(t-\tau)}{k})B(t-\tau) -\delta_M B(t) - F(t) B(t)$$</P><P>

There is research that suggests the fish meal in the feed can be replaced entirely by other sources, including soybean meal.  With the work of our lab team, it is now the case that farmed fish need not rely on wild fish for their fish oil, either.</P><P>We proceeded to investigate the effect on fish biomass if aquaculture output was presumed to remain at its 2006 level (we acknowledge this is a rather conservative estimate) and, from 2006 onwards, farmed fish were produced using feed from non-fish based products.  Thus, we could reduce our projected yearly catch figures for 2006-2100 by 0.7 x (Aquaculture Output at 2006).</P><P>The effect was remarkable.  The outcome from our model was entirely unrecognisable compared to the story of death and near-extinction previously predicted.  Fish survived into the future and indeed flourished, as their population grew exponentially!</P><H2>The cost of success</H2><P>In order to produce farmed fish at a level resembling 2006 output, using non-fish based products for feed, how much omega-3 is required?  Is it plausible that iGEM Team St Andrews can save our oceans in this way?</P><P>We calculated required omega-3 by examining the number of wild fish required to produce the 2006 aquaculture output and then multiplying this figure by the average omega-3 content per tonne of fish biomass.  We also proceeded to investigate how much omega three our “factory” would have to produce if we terminated traditional aquaculture in 2006 and used our own idea of aquaculture (zero wild fish input) to produce enough fish to maintain the current fish (available for human use) to population ratio.  (The current fish to population ratio was calculated by averaging <I>((catch(t)+aquaculture(t)-(catch required to produce aquaculture)(t))/population(t)</I> over the years between 2000 and 2010).  Finally, we examined how much omega-3 Team St Andrews would have to produce in order to, by means of our alternative aquaculture, provide every person in our world with their recommended 0.5g (Kris-Etherton, 2007) of omega-3 per day.</P></DIV><DIV class="span5"><DIV id="myCarousel3" class="carousel slide"><DIV class="carousel-inner"><DIV class="active item"><P><SPAN class="label label-info">Chart: From model – a biomass picture for the future</SPAN></P><DIV class="carousel-caption"><H4><SPAN class="badge badge">1/5</SPAN> The Future for Fish</H4><P>Model's prediction of world fish biomass, as it changes throughout the years between 1950 and 2100; as well as biomass data.

</H4><P>If we implement changes to our fishing habits, and reduce our predicted catch for the future (previous graph) by (0.7 x farmed fish produced in 2006) each year, our model can predict a very different outcome for fish in time.  (We reduce catch by the specified amount each year as a result of the fact that we assume aquaculture output to remain at 2006 level and that for every one tonne of farmed fish produced, 0.7 tonnes of wild fish are required for feed.  With our alternative omega 3 production, we think it is finally possible to produce this level of farmed fish with no input from our oceans).
