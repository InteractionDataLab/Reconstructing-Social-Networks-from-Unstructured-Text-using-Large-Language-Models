The lysozyme solution (10 mg/mL) was prepared in lysis buffer. </P><P>5. The lysozyme solution (200 μL) was added to each pellet and re-suspended. Benzonase nuclease (1 μL) was added, and one protease inhibitor cocktail pill was dissolved in the mixture. This was then
vortexed and incubated in the shaker (37 °C for 30 min to 1 h). </P><P>6. The cells were then sonicated. </P><P>7. The sonicated cells were then spun down  at full speed for 1 min in the centrifuge . </P><P>8. GST beads were prepared. GST slurry (100 µL) was added to each sample and spun down at full
speed. The supernatant was then removed. PBS (100 µL) was added to each sample, and the mixture re-
suspended and spun down at full speed for 1 min. </P><P>9. The supernatant was then removed and PBS (100 µL) added per sample, re-suspended and
transferred to eppendorf tubes, 100 µL per sample. The mixture spun down at
full speed for 1 min and supernatant was then removed. The supernatant of the sonicated cells was
then added. </P><P>10. 10. The samples were agitated for 30 min to 3 h in the cold room. Samples were spun down at full speed for 1 min. Supernatant was removed. </P><P>11. GST beads were washed with PBS, 200 µL per sample. Samples were spun down at full speed
and supernatant was removed. Glutathione solution (50 µl, 100 mM) was added . The samples were
agitated for 10 to 30 min in the cold room. </P><P>12. The samples were spun at full speed for 1 min. 10 µL of supernatant was taken and dye (10 µL,
2x) was added. </P><P>13. The protein samples were denatured using the heating block at 95° C. </P><P>14. The samples were cooled on ice (1 min) then loaded onto the gel (prepared according to SDS-
PAGE standard protocol) and run at 150 V for 45 min. </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
