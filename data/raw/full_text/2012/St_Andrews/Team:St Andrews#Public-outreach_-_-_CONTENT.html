We had a number of exhibits, each catering to a different audience:
<UL><LI>For the littlest kids, we ran an interactive &quot;Codon Game&quot;, where children could &quot;build a gene&quot; from little paper parts.</LI><LI>We had interactive visualizations of <EM>DNA</EM> and <EM>Thermus aquaticus polymerase III</EM>, complete with 3D glasses, thanks to an impromptu collaboration with the Psychology department!</LI><LI>For those who like to see the things we work with, we had a display of of E. coli on plates, under a microscope and in broth. Children and adults alike were fascinated by our live experiment, extracting DNA from bananas using everyday kitchen equipment.</LI></UL></P><P>We took every chance to mingle with the crowd and to answer questions.

We hosted an &quot;Ethics Forum&quot; with Dr Morven Shearer from the School of Medicine and we advertised the event in the science departments beforehand.  At 4pm on Wednesday 4th July, our chosen meeting room was filled and we discussed the difference between Synthetic Biology and Genetic Engineering; concerns that arise when the BBC broadcasts news of the first &quot;spider-goat&quot;; as well as what should be done to combat false and exaggerated claims about scientific research.  Although many of the participants held contrasting views, even in response to the question of &quot;What is Synthetic Biology?&quot;, some opinions were held by all. In particular we agreed, as scientists living in a world dominated by media headlines, the decisions we make when we share news of our work can be as influential as the decisions we make while carrying out our work.</P><H3>Multimedia Debate and Poster Campaign</H3><P>We facilitated two multimedia debates during our ten weeks of project work.  Participants were invited to write their responses on one of the many posters displayed around campus and town; by tweeting us, or by writing a comment on our Facebook page.

How does the advent of emerging Scientific Discipline Synthetic Biology affect our viewpoint?</P><P>Recently, Synthetic Biology made possible the creation of the world's first artificial cell (<A href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10132762">www.bbc.co.uk/news/10132762</A>). Dr Craig Venter of the J Craig Venter Institute led his team to design and produce an entire genome - all genetic information governing the function of a cell - in the Lab. The resulting micro-organism had no parents.  With such &quot;advances&quot; in this Scientific Discipline, how is our understanding of the concept of &quot;life&quot; affected? If new organisms can be created so readily, does the value we associate with mortality change?&quot;</P></LI><LI><P>&quot;Juan Enriquez says autism, synaesthesia, photographic memory, and extreme concentration ability are mutations that let their hosts deal with overwhelming amounts of information. In today's environment, that's what gives you a competitive edge. It's human evolution in action. Geeks are a new species. Geeks harbor some surprising powers. For the first time in the history of evolution, a species has flipped the tables. They routinely outdo the evolution that made them. They haven't killed it, but they could. There is no technical barrier for human genetic modification. They've levelled up.</P><P><A href="http://www.ted.com/talks/juan_enriquez_will_our_kids_be_a_different_species.html">www.ted.com/talks/juan_enriquez_will_our_kids_be_a_different_species.html</A></P><P>Hold on to your evolutionary fitnesses, ladies and gentlemen: &quot;Homo evolutis&quot; is coming and it's coming to compete.

She moved to Slovenia during high school, where she completed the international Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Now she studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, which has a strong reputation for academic excellence.</P><P>In the three years of her studies she was included in the University Dean’s list, and she is now involved in a undergraduate team taking part in the iGEM synthetic biology competition. Competitors construct and operate biological systems in living cells. ThisiGEM team seeksto use the combined dynamics of synthetic biology, computer science and engineering to create both a novel precious metal recycling scheme as well as a renewable source of essential fatty acids Omega-3. They are planning to recreate an Omega-3 fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in E. Coli, while also trying to produce a series of metal-binding proteins, through which they intend to create a new way of recycling them. By representing her Scottish university in this competition, she is not only gaining experience and knowledge in laboratory research, but she is also able to contact the global scientific community and with Slovenia, where she is planning to return after her studies.</P></DIV><DIV class="modal-footer"><A href="#" class="btn" data-dismiss="modal">Close</A></DIV></DIV><DIV class="container" id="content-container"><FOOTER class="footer"><P class="pull-right"><A href="#">Back to top</A></P><P>University of St Andrews, 2012.</P><P>Contact us: <A href="mailto:igem2012@st-andrews.ac.uk">igem2012@st-andrews.ac.uk</A>, <A href="https://twitter.com/#!/StAndrewsiGEM12">Twitter</A>, <A href="https://www.facebook.com/StAndrewsiGEM12">Facebook</A></P><P><SMALL>This iGEM team has been funded by the MSD Scottish Life Sciences Fund.
