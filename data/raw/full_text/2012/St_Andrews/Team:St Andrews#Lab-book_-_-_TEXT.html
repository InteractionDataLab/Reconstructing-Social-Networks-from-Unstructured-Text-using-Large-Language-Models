Transformation
1.      Frozen cells were thawed from -80 °C.
2.      Thawed cells (10 μL) were mixed with vector (1 μL), and left on ice for 30 min.
3.      LB liquid medium (1 mL) was warmed at 37°C for 30 min.
4.      The cell/vector mix was heated at 42 °C for 45 seconds.
5.      Warm LB (50 μL) was added to the cell vector mix.
6.      Mixture was shaken at 37 °C for 30 min.
7.      Mixture was plated onto ampicillin agar plates and left overnight.
8.      Recombinant E. Coli was harvested from agar plate by scratching gently with the scraper.
9.      The scraper tip was placed into Falcon tubes with LB (10 mL) and ampicillin (1 μL) to transfer the E. Coli into medium.
10.   The E. Coli was incubated in a shaker at 37 °C for less than 20 hr.
Miniprep
We used Qiagen's QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit, the protocol can be found here .
Preparing an agarose electrophoresis gel
1. Preparing 1% agarose solution: Agarose powder (1 g) was dissolved in TAE (Tris base, acetic acid and EDTA) buffer (100 mL). This was heated in the microwave until the solution was transparent. Ethidium Bromide (8 μL) was added.
2. The solution was poured into an assembled gel rigand allowed to set.
3. Prepared samples were loaded into the wells(5-20 μL) along with DNA ladder (5 μL).
4. The gel was run at 80 V for 20-50 min.
5. The gel was visualised under UV light
 
Ratios for sample preparation vary depending on the type of sample:
Miniprep - use 4 μL sample and 2 μL dye
Digestion - use 1 μL sample and 2 μL dye
PCR- use 10μl sample and 1μl dye
When using GoTaq®, simply load 10 μL onto the gel, as dye is already included.
Always make up to 10 μL using water.
Digestion
1.      The sample (30μl) was prepared in the following sequnce:
Miniprep (20 μL)
Corresponding buffer (8 μL)
Each restriction enzyme (1 μL of each)
 
2. The sample was incubated at 37 °C in a water bath.  Timings depended on the restriction enzymes brand.

GoTaq® MasterMix buffer (23 μL)
Forward and reveerse primers (1 μL each)
to make a 50μL PCR solution
2. An Eppendorf tube was prepared for each PRC tube.
3. Using a small pipette tip, one colony was scratched off a plate and dipped into the tip into the PCR tube.  Tips were then stored in the corresponding Eppendorf tubes (for further incubation, if positive).
4. The PCR was ran using optimal annealing temperatures for the required gene, and then the samples of the PCR run straight on electrophoresis.
6.  Positive results from the samples were incubated from the corresponding tips.
Phosphatase treatment of linearized vector

2. Add 1μL phosphatase.
3. Incubate 60 mins at 37°C.
4. Heat-shock for 5 mins at 65°C.
Ligation
Ligation molar ratio calculation:
Exposure intensity from UV light was used to quantify the DNA in ng (i.e. the concentration of both insert and vector) against ladder position for sequence length (i.e. molar weight ratio of the two)
Rule of 3: Three times as much insert as vector ensures successful ligation results
 
1. Ligation solution (20 μL) was prepared
10x buffer (2 μL)
T4 ligase (2 μL)
Vectors and insert (~17 μL), according to calculated ratio
make up to a total of 20 μL using water
2. The ligation mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 10-30 minutes..
3. The ligase-treated vector-insert mixture was mixed with E. Coli (DH5-α)(60 μL), then the standard transformation protocol was followed with shaking for 1 hr; finally LB (200 μL) was added.

Induction
1. The optimal density (OD) of a portion of the sample (1 mL) was measured in the spectrophotometer using LB as a blank.

Protein Visualization (SDS and Western Blot)
1. Making the membrane transfer sandwiches: 2x A2 at the bottom, then 2x A2.
2. The membrane, GE Healthcare HyBond ECL films, was cut out using a glass template; the membrane was put onto moist A2 filter papers and pressed flat using a roll.

3. After cooling, the samples were evaporated to dryness with nitrogen and were dried twice more from methanol : water (1:1) (200 µL) to remove all traces of ammonia.
4. The protonated fatty acids are then extracted by partitioning between HCl (500 µL, 20 mM) and of ether (500 µL); the aqueous phase was re-extracted with fresh ether (500µL) and the combined ether phases were dried under nitrogen in a glass tube.
5. The fatty acids were converted to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), by adding diazomethane (3x 20 µL aliquots) to the dried residue, while on ice. After 30min, the samples were allowed to warm to RT and left to evaporate to dryness in a fume hood.
6. The FAME products were dissolved in dichloromethane (10-20 µL) and analysed (1-2 µL) by GC-MS on a Agilent Technologies (GC-6890N, MS detector-5973) with a ZB-5 column (30M x 25mm x 25mm, Phenomenex), with a temperature program of at 70 °C for 10min followed by a gradient to 220 °C at 5 °C /min and held at 220 °C for a further 15min
7. Mass spectra were acquired from 50-500 amu. The identity of FAMEs was carried out by comparison of the retention time and fragmentation pattern with a Bacterial FAME standard (Supelco).
