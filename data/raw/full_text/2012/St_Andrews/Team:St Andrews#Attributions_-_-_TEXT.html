We would like to thank Dr Markus Gierth at the University of Cologne for kindly providing us with several colonies of Synechocystis sp.
Adam Boggon braved icy North Sea temperatures to support us with his photographic skill!
Twitter's Bootstrap framework has helped us a lot while developing the wiki.
Dr Morven Shearer from the School of Medicine, for providing a thought-provoking "Ethics Forum" for the team and colleagues from the University.
Professor Gordon Bell from the Institute of Aquaculture at the University of Stirling, who provided vital insight when we sought to establish the relationship between alternative production of omega-3 and future fish catch predictions.
DTU-Denmark 2011 (iGEM team) documented exactly how they styled their MediaWiki page. We found lots of inspiration in it. Thanks to you, DTU!
Jason Fontana is a webdesign-savvy (even better than us!) member of iGEM Trento 2012 who wrote a few great introductory posts in the Trento '12 blog early into iGEM, which helped us get our site-styling off the ground. Thanks Jason and greetings to the other folks at Trento!
Jesse H. Ausubel – Director of the Program for the Human Environment at The Rockefeller University and Vice President for Programs of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, who inspired us by the talk about the Census of Marine Life and provided some valuable critique of the project.
School of Geography & Geosciences, University of St Andrews, allowed us to use their ICP-MS for the characterization of some of our BioBricks.
The Terry K. Smith Laboratory members guided us in the lab and helped us troubleshooting experiments.
