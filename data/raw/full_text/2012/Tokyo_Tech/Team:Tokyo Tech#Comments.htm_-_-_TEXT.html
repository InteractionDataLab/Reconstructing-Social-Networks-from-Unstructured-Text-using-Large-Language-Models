Possible gold medal condition
We transferred, to WHU-China team, information and a plasmid of our past part of iGEM 2006, whose record has lost in Wiki and parts registry "get this part" link. We thus think preparation of iGEM 2006 parts can be a "help for another team" gold medal condition, though requests for past parts should be sent to HQ for the first choice.
