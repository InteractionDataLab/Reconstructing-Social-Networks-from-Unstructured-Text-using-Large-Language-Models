Best new BioBrick part (natural): BBa_K934001
We constructed a part containing phaC1-A-B1 in Biobrick format ( BBa_K934001 ). This is the first Biobrick part that succeeded in synthesizing Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs).
Best new BioBrick part (engineered): BBa_K934022
(+BBa_K934012 is positive feedback system)
We constructed BBa_K934022 by combining Plux promter ( BBa_R0062 ) and LasI ( BBa_K081016 ). This is the first Biobrick part that succeeded in 3OC6HSL dependent 3OC12HSL production. Moreover, by co-culturing the cells containing this part with the cells containing 3OC6HSL dependent 3OC12HSL producer part ( BBa_K934012 ), we succeeded in constructing a positive feedback system.
Best improved part(s): BBa_K934012 , BBa_K934025
BBa_K934012 : By constructing BBa_K934012 , we improved a 3OC12HSL-dependent LuxI generator part. Even though a 3OC12HSL-dependent LuxI generator ( BBa_K266000 ) was constructed by IPN-UNAM-Mexico 2009 team, no experimental data has been supplied.  Moreover, BBa_R0079 , the lasI promoter used in BBa_K266000 , was evaluated as an ineffective promoter in the Experience Page of the Registry. Thus, in this study, we constructed a new Plas-LuxI ( BBa_K934012 ) by using an effective lasI promoter ( BBa_K649000 ) and confirmed its activity. This result can be considered as an improvement of the 3OC12HSL-dependent LuxI generator part.
BBa_K934025 : By constructing BBa_K934025 , we improved a Plux/tet hybrid promoter part. Even though a Plux/tet hybrid promoter was constructed by USTC 2009 team, their experiment did not contain the inducer combination: 3OC6HSL(-) and aTc(+). Thus, data of Plux/tet hybrid promoter in Biobrick Registry was not sufficient. In this study, we constructed a new Plux/tet-GFP ( BBa_K934025 ) and confirmed its activity under all four combinations. This result can be considered as an improvement of the Plux/tet hybrid promoter part.
