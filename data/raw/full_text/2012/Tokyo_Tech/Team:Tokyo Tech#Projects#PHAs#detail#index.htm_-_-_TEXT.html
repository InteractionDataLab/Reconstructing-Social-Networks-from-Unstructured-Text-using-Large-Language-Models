Production trial of PHAs by past teams
[ Back to "Construction of phaC1-A-B1 in Biobrick format" ]
We introduce some attempts in the past iGEM to show how great our work is in iGEM.
iGEM10_Caltech
Part number

BBa_K338003
PHA Synthase Composite, Part 1/2
Planning
BBa_K338004
PHA Synthase Composite, Part 1/2
Available
None
They couldn’t prove that their engineered bacteria produced PHB according to the team wiki.

BBa_K342001
Pha C (poly-β-hydroxybutyrate polymerase)
Available
None
They registered and submitted a part, which contains only phaC sequence, as worked. But the team wiki shows that the part doesn’t meet the standard which is required in iGEM because they couldn’t cut their part with XbaI.
