Construction of the 3OC12HSL-dependent 3OC6HSL production module
For construction of the 3OC12HSL-dependent 3OC6HSL production module, we firstly constructed a new part Plas-LuxI ( BBa_K934012 ). Plas-LuxI cell is an engineered E.coli that contains a 3OC12HSL-dependent LuxI generator and a constitutive LasR generator. As the 3OC12HSL-dependent LuxI generator, we constructed a new Biobrick part Plas-LuxI ( BBa_K934012 )by combining Plas promoter ( BBa_K649000 ). and LuxI ( BBa_K081008 ). As a constitutive LasR generator, we used Ptrc-LasR. By introducing Plas-LuxI and Ptrc-LasR into E.coli strain JM 2.300, we constructed Plas-LuxI cell. Then we performed a reporter assay by using Lux reporter cell to characterize the function of Plas-LuxI. As the negative control of 3OC6HSL production, we prepared 3OC6HSL non-producer cell (ΔP-LuxI cell) that contains, in addition to Ptrc-LasR, promoterless-LuxI ( BBa_K081008 ) instead of Plas-LuxI (Fig2-1-3-1-5).
Fig2-1-3-1-5, Lux sender strain and Lux reporter strain
The ΔP-LuxI cell does not produce 3OC6HSL even though 3OC12HSL exist. The supernatants of the cultures of these modules were used as the inducer in the reporter assay (Fig2-1-3-1-6).
Fig2-1-3-1-6, How to perform 3OC12HSL-dependent 3OC6HSL production assay
We prepared four conditions as follow.
E) Culture containing Plas-LuxI cell without 3OC12HSL induction
F) Culture containing Plas-LuxI cell with 3OC12HSL induction
G) Culture containing ⊿P-LuxI cell without 3OC12HSL induction
H) Culture containing ⊿P-LuxI cell with 3OC12HSL induction
Using the supernatant of the four culture conditions, we performed the reporter assay.  In the reporter assay, we used a Lux reporter strain that contains Ptet-LuxR and Plux-GFP ( BBa_K395100 ). Also, a reporter cell that expresses GFP constitutively and a reporter cell that does not express GFP were used as the positive control and the negative control, respectively.
Fig2-1-3-1-7, 3OC12HSL-dependent 3OC6HSL production
Fig2-1-3-1-7 shows fluorescence intensities by the reporter cells dependent on different conditions. Only when the supernatant of condition F was used, the fluorescence intensity of the Lux reporter cell increased while the supernatants of other three conditions did not affect. Comparing the results of the condition E and F, it can be said that with the induction of 3OC12HSL to Plas-LuxI, the fluorescence intensity of the Lux reporter cell increased by 112-folds. This result indicates that Plas-LuxI cell produced 3OC6HSL in response to 3OC12HSL induction by the function of Plas-LuxI ( BBa_K934012 ) From this experiment, we confirmed that a new part Plas-LuxI ( BBa_K934012 ) synthesized enough concentration of 3OC6HSL to induce the Lux reporter cell.

1. collect liquid culture
1.1 Prepare overnight culture of inducer cell at 37°C for 12hours.
1.2 Take 30μl of the overnight culture of inducer cell into LB(3ml) + antibiotics (Amp 50μg/ml + Kan 30μg/ml).(→fresh culture)
1.3 Incubate the flesh culture of inducer cell until the observed OD600 reaches around 0.50. Centrifuge the cell at 5000g, 25°C, 1 min, suspend it with 1ml LB + antibiotics (Amp 50μg/ml).
1.4 Take 30μl cell suspensions into LB(3ml) + antibiotics (Amp 50μg/ml + Kan 30μg/ml) + 5μM 3OC6HSL(3μl) and LB(3ml) + antibiotics (Amp 50μg/ml + Kan 30μg/ml) + DMSO(3μl).
1.5 Incubate the 3OC12HSL producer cells for another 4 hours at 37°C.
1.6 Centrifuge the 3OC12HSL producer cells at 9000g, 4°C, 1 min, and filter the cultured cells.
1.7 Dilute the filtrate by LB + antibiotics (Amp + Kan) in 1:30.
