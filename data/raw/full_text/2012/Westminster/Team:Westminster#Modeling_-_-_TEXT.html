Modelling of PEI transfection
Introduction
Effective delivery of DNA to cultured mammalian cell requires that the DNA be complexed with a transfection agent. A number of commercial transfection reagents are available and are routinely used in mammalian transfection. It is crucial that each cell line or transfection condition is tested to ensure successful optimal expression. We present here, the use of PEI (polyethylenimine) for effective transfection of MCF7 cell line. Transfection has been optimised using an eGFP plasmid.
What is     PEI?
Poly (ethylalenimine) was     identified as a transfection reagent in 1995. It is a linear cationic polymer     which condenses negatively charged DNA molecules to produce positively charged     particles. These positively charged complexes interact with negatively charged     cell surface residues and are internalised via endocytosis.
How is the DNA released in the cell?
Once inside the cell, the amine groups of the PEI polymer accept     protons to become more positively charged. This causes an influx of counter     ions resulting in osmotic swelling. Osmotic swelling leads to bursting of the     vesicle, and release of the DNA-PEI complex. The PEI unpacks from the DNA in     the cytoplasm allowing the DNA to diffuse to the nucleus.
Why isn’t PEI more widely used?
PEI is extremely cytotoxic. It causes disruption     of the cell membrane which then leads to immediate cell death or it may disrupts     the mitochondrial membrane which leads to delayed death of cells.
If PEI is toxic, why suggest its use?
The high cost of mammalian cell culture is     possibly one of the restricting factors encouraging iGEM teams and other     researchers from working with mammalian cells. PEI is a very cheap transfection     reagent, which works!  
Protocol for preparing the PEI-DNA     mixture and transfection of MCF7 cells (As performed by Andrew Jenks)
All cell culture and transfection was     carried in complete media Dulbecco’s modified eagles media (DMEM) supplemented     with 10 % foetal bovine serum (FBS). No antibiotics were used, cells were     transiently transfected.
Procedure
On the day prior to transfection 250000 MCF7 cells were     seeded per well of a 24 well plate.
For each transfection, reagents were prepared as follows:
Plasmid mixed with PEI.PEI volumes     used were either 0 µl, 3 µl, 6 µl, 9 µl, 12 µl and 15 µl. Plasmid concentration was either at 0 µg, 0.36 µg, 0.7 µg, 1.46 µg, 2.92 µg and 5.84 µg. Combinations     of the PEI and plasmid was used.
100 µl (10% of growth media volume) of     0.15M NaCl was added to the plasmid-PEI mixture
Transfection reagent mixture was vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 10 mins
The 24 well plate was removed from the incubator. Prior to transfection, old media was removed from each well and replaced     with fresh media. Prior to transfection, the old media from each well was     replaced with fresh media. The PEI-plasmid-NaCl mixture was the added dropwise with even distribution     to cells. Cells were incubated overnight at 37ᵒC. The following day, cells were assessed for cell health     and the media replaced. After this the cells were allowed to recover for 48hrs before beingtrypsinised.
Cells were analysed by flow cytometery as follows:
Media was removed and the cells were washed once with PBS.     Cells were then trypsinised with 0.21mM trypsin     containing 4.81 mM EDTA. The trypsin was then neutralized     with the addition of complete media and cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for     3 mins
Cells were then washed once in ice cold PBS containing 1% foetal     bovine serum (FBS) and  re-suspended in 1% FBS containing     1ug/ml propidium iodide.
Cells were analysed using CyAn™     ADP flow cytometer (DakoCytomation). In order     to distinguish between alive and dead cells propidum iodide was used and data was analysed using the summit v4.3 software. Cell lines     were gated according to an unstained sample and lasers were adjusted     accordingly. Unstained cells were used to set gates for cell size and internal     complexity, dead cells were removed along with doublets.
RESULTS:
Results of the transfection using the PEI and plasmid concentrations was     as follows:
6 µl of PEI with 1.46 µg of plasmid gave the highest level of     transfection. 43% of cells were transfected. This is highly favourable in     comparison to other transfection reagents. Increasing the DNA concentration did     not improve transfection.
