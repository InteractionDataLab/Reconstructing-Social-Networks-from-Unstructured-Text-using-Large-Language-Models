A number of commercial transfection reagents are available and are routinely used in mammalian transfection. It is crucial that each cell line or transfection condition is tested to ensure successful optimal expression. We present here, the use of PEI (polyethylenimine) for effective transfection of MCF7 cell line. Transfection has been optimised using an eGFP plasmid. </P><P><SPAN style="color:red">What is
    PEI?</SPAN></P><P>Poly (<SPAN class="SpellE">ethylalenimine</SPAN>) was
    identified as a transfection reagent in 1995. It is a linear cationic polymer
    which condenses negatively charged DNA molecules to produce positively charged
    particles. These positively charged complexes interact with negatively charged
    cell surface residues and are internalised via endocytosis. </P><P><SPAN style="color:red">How is the DNA released in the cell?</SPAN></P><P>Once inside the cell, the amine groups of the PEI polymer accept
    protons to become more positively charged. This causes an influx of counter
    ions resulting in osmotic swelling. Osmotic swelling leads to bursting of the
    vesicle, and release of the DNA-PEI complex. The PEI unpacks from the DNA in
    the cytoplasm allowing the DNA to diffuse to the nucleus. </P><P><SPAN style="color:red">Why isn’t PEI more widely used?</SPAN></P><P>PEI is extremely cytotoxic. It causes disruption
    of the cell membrane which then leads to immediate cell death or it may disrupts
    the mitochondrial membrane which leads to delayed death of cells. </P><P><SPAN style="color:red">If PEI is toxic, why suggest its use?</SPAN></P><P>The high cost of mammalian cell culture is
    possibly one of the restricting factors encouraging iGEM teams and other
    researchers from working with mammalian cells. PEI is a very cheap transfection
    reagent, which works!  </P><P><SPAN style="color:red">Protocol for preparing the PEI-DNA
    mixture and transfection of MCF7 cells (As performed by Andrew Jenks)</SPAN></P><P>All cell culture and transfection was
    carried in complete media Dulbecco’s modified eagles media (DMEM) supplemented
    with 10 % foetal bovine serum (FBS). No antibiotics were used, cells were
    transiently transfected. </P><P>Procedure </P><P>On the day prior to transfection 250000 MCF7 cells were
    seeded per well of a 24 well plate.</P><P>For each transfection, reagents were prepared as follows:</P><P>Plasmid mixed with PEI.PEI volumes
    used were either 0 µl, 3 µl, 6 µl, 9 µl, 12 µl and 15 µl. Plasmid concentration
    was either at 0 µg, 0.36 µg, 0.7 µg, 1.46 µg, 2.92 µg and 5.84 µg. Combinations
    of the PEI and plasmid was used. </P><P>100 µl (10% of growth media volume) of
    0.15M NaCl was added to the plasmid-PEI mixture</P><P>Transfection reagent mixture was vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 10 mins</P><P>The 24 well plate was removed from the incubator. Prior to transfection, old media was removed from each well and replaced
    with fresh media. Prior to transfection, the old media from each well was
    replaced with fresh media. The PEI-plasmid-NaCl mixture was the added dropwise with even distribution
    to cells. Cells were incubated overnight at 37ᵒC. The following day, cells were assessed for cell health
    and the media replaced. After this the cells were allowed to recover for 48hrs before beingtrypsinised.</P><P>Cells were analysed by flow <SPAN class="SpellE">cytometery</SPAN> as follows:</P><P>Media was removed and the cells were washed once with PBS.
    Cells were then <SPAN class="SpellE">trypsinised</SPAN> with 0.21mM trypsin
    containing 4.81 <SPAN class="SpellE">mM</SPAN> EDTA. The trypsin was then neutralized
    with the addition of complete media and cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for
    3 <SPAN class="SpellE">mins</SPAN></P><P>Cells were then washed once in ice cold PBS containing 1% foetal
    bovine serum (FBS) <SPAN class="GramE">and  re</SPAN>-suspended in 1% FBS containing
    1ug/ml <SPAN class="SpellE">propidium</SPAN> iodide.</P><P>Cells were analysed using <SPAN class="SpellE">CyAn</SPAN>™
    ADP flow cytometer (<SPAN class="SpellE">DakoCytomation</SPAN>). In order
    to distinguish between alive and dead cells <SPAN class="SpellE">propidum</SPAN> iodide was used and data was analysed using the summit v4.3 software. Cell lines
    were gated according to an unstained sample and lasers were adjusted
    accordingly. Unstained cells were used to set gates for cell size and internal
    complexity, dead cells were removed along with doublets.</P><P style="line-height:normal;"><B><SPAN style="font-size:10.0pt;

">RESULTS:</SPAN></B></P><P style="line-height:normal"><SPAN style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black;">Results of the transfection using the PEI and plasmid concentrations was
    as follows:</SPAN></P><P>6 µl of PEI with 1.46 µg of plasmid gave the highest level of
    transfection. 43% of cells were transfected. This is highly favourable in
    comparison to other transfection reagents. Increasing the DNA concentration did
    not improve transfection. </P><P><SPAN lang="PT">References:
