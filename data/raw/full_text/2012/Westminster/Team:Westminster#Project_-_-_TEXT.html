Cancer recurrence is one of the fears that almost every patient undergoing chemotherapy develops. Recent findings suggest that only a small fraction of the tumor cells, called Cancer Stem Cells (CSC) are able to drive the growth of the tumor. CSC also show an increased drug resistance, and could remain unaffected after chemotherapy, eventually resulting in the formation of a new tumor.
