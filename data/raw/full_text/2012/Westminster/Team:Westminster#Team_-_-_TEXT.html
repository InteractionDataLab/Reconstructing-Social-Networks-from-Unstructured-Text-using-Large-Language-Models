The Team
Silvia Berciano
Silvia is a third year Molecular Biology & Genetics student with a background in Electronic Engineering and Industrial Design. Her hobbies include traveling, drawing, watching Game of Thrones and most recently trying to find the best ice cream in London. Her main academic fields of interest are Epigenetics, Nutrigenomics, Synthetic Biology and Bioinformatics.
Radek Kwasniak
Radek is graduating this year with a MSc in Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology.  Apart from finding a cure for cancer using synthetic biology, he enjoys   travelling, reading books on evolutionary biology and martial arts.
Moyin Odugbemi
Currently studying Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, Moyin's main   academic interests are Biochemical engineering and the Pseudomonas   species. She has a background in pure Biochemistry. When she's not being a scientist, she likes to read, hang out in parks, people watch and write. Having personally encountered cancer, she believes strongly that this  project is pivotal to developing a cure and saving millions of lives. 
Hima Puthussery
Hima is currently staring at synthetic biology with a new found enthusiasm, trying to figure out how well to play with it. Her background is a combination of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Zoology, further supplemented by applied microbiology. She loves poetry, arts and climbing- and would love to make a bacteria do all this! She really believes we all are in a large fermenter, constantly evolving, adapting and producing metabolites that we alone can define.
Louise Usher
Louise is doing a MSc in Microbiology and Plant Pathology. She loves  working in the LAB and have found iGEM to be great exposure to molecular biology and synthetic biology. Here hobbies include travelling, reading, flying kites and eating out.
Shanmuga Priya Subramaniam
Priya has just finished her MSc. Medical Microbiology. Her main motivation to join in iGEM team was learning more microbiology and molecular biology laboratory techniques. She also thinks that the cancer project is really challenging and she is excited about its potential future applications.
Ana Sokolovic
Ana is an undergraduate and is about to start her third year of her Graphic Communication Design course (BA Honours). Her hobbies include drawing, playing  guitar, socialising, watching movies, reading, and gaming.
