Westminster iGEM 2012 ideas storm meeting. Discussion about recruiting more members to the team.
May 21
Advertising poster made and put up around Cavendish campus     inviting student to attend the next iGEM meeting.
May 23
Westminster iGEM 2012 ideas storm meeting. Criteria for assessing     proposed project ideas discussed. Criteria will include:  Feasibility, WoWfactor, Application,     Impact and Relevance to synthetic biology
May 25
Presentation of project ideas by individuals to the group.
May 30
Evaluation of ideas presented.
June 1
Two more possible project ideas brought forward.
1. Idea for detection of proliferating bacterial cells. After     more research and discussion it was found that the complexity of cell surface     ligands of Gram Negative bacteria may mean that the project is not likely to be     feasible.
2.  Designing  bacteria which dissolve chewing gum on     pavements raised by Silvia. This idea is to be explored further.
June 6
More work being done on the chewing gum idea. Additionally,     other members of the team have been reading more about the iGEM competition and     biobrick assembly.
June 16
Identification of key resources still required. Need to     narrow down idea for the group, and get a few more students involved. Need to     get some financial support.
June 30
Project discussions.
July 2
Identification of main projects to focus on – The     chewing gum idea. Also the possibility of doing radic’s tattoo idea.
July 4
Developing the chewing gum idea has continued. A number of     important factors need to be determined.
1. Researching the composition of gum.
2. Assessing whether the chewing gum idea is feasible as a     synthetic biology project.
3. Looking for parts in the iGEM registry and determining     other components required.
July 9
Update on progress in developing the chewing gum idea. A lab     experiment has been designed to determine if the bubble gum idea would work.
July 13
R.I.P. chewing gum idea! Lab experiment showed that the idea     required  more of a chemical     solution rather than biological.
New idea     of Cancer stem cells (CSC) was raised.    http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19083685
Although the existence of CSC was     introduced more than 40 years ago, it has only been in the last 10 years that     the identification of Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) as a biomarker of CSC has     allowed for these cells to be detected and isolated. The project proposal is     therefore to create molecular constructs for the detection, isolation and     destruction of Cancer stem cells.
2 days to deadline for project proposals!
July 15
Cancer stem cell idea voted as the Westminster iGEM project     and submitted to iGEM.
July 17
Task plan generated. Research started by a number of team     members. Group members also continued researching building biobricks.
July 20
Identification of the four ALDH isoforms which will be used     in the project.
ALDH1A1 –ALDH-1 family
 ALDH1A3 – ALDH-1 family
 ALDH3A1 – AHDH     3 family
 ALDH2 – to     be used as control
We need to identify the promoters for each of the isoforms.
July 22
Research into Cre-lox technology. Continued research on the     project and search for ALDH promoter sequences.
Hima has looked at ALDH2 promoter sequence and has     identified a 903bp sequence. A commercial sequence has also been found which     has identical sequence to the PUBMED identified sequence.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/217
Additionally, a PstI site has been identified in the     promoter region. This will need to be removed by site directed mutagenesis.
July 23
Further feedback on ALDH promoters. Karin had found     the promoter for ALDH1A1. There seems to be a number of restriction sites in     the promoter. The gene codes in the reverse direction. This is important when     designing primers.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/216
Silvia has looked at ALDH3A1. Promoter region has been identified     and primers designed incorporating prefix and suffix biobrick regions.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/218
Proposed     Promoter Sequence: (position -19649444 to -19648446) = 998bp
Forward-Primer: TGAACTTCTGACCTCAGGTGA
Reverse-Primer:  CGGCCTCGCTGATCTTGC
July 24
Further work on primer design. Clarification of prefix and     suffix regions for building biobricks. ALDH3A1 further analysed, EcoR1 and 2     PstI sites identified.
July 25
Need to review ALDH1A1 promoter region. Short video provided by     Mark on using NCBI to find promoter regions has been useful to the group.  ALDH1A1 promoter region corrected by     Karin. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/216   75569370 to -75568234 on negative     strand.
Additionally, a search for biobrick parts begun. List of     parts required has been drawn up and assigned to members.
July 27
Primers designed for ALDH1A1.
Forward-Primer                         CATCATATGACTTTTTTCAAC    
Reverse-Primer            TTCTGATTCGGCTCCTGGAA
More research on the Cre-lox system done. A means of     switching on and off may be required. Parts for the cre-lox system sought from     the parts registry.
Mammalian parts identified from 2011 DTU-Denmark iGEM team.     These are not standard assembly parts. Need to make a decision on how these     will be used, ie. do we go down the PlugnPlay assembly route. It may be     necessary as standard mammalian parts have not been located in the registry. Clarification     on using PlugnPlay has been sought from IGEM on assembly rules.
July 29
Continued  investigation into PlugnPlay assembly.
July 30
Registered for iGEM UK Team Hangout. 
Karin identified EcoR1 as the only illegal site in ALDH1A1     promoter sequence.
July 31
Following iGEM response a decision to use PlugnPlay assembly     has been taken. BUT parts will have to be made standard for submitting to the iGEM     registry.  In particular, it will     still be necessary to remove illegal sites from promoter regions.
August 1
Project has been further defined and some new roles     delegated. Discussion on mutagenisis and removing illegal sites from the     promoter region.
August 2
Promoter sequence of ALDH1A3 determined and primers     designed.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/220
Promoter sequence checked against commercially available     sequences. No illegal sites found in the promoter region.
August 3
Search for antibiotic resistance gene for mammalian cells in     the biobrick registry. Search for backbone for mammalian expression continues.
August 4
More discussion on the use of PlugnPlay. Using PlugnPlay     means that we could test the un-mutated promoters, but would have to do the     mutation to conform to parts standards. It remains uncertain how mutagenisis     will affect the promoter activity.
August 5
Possible backbone identified.
ALDH2 promoter sequence determined and PstI site has been     found. Primer for amplification of the promoter region have been designed.     There is a suggestion that it may be possible to omit the region containing the     PstI site. This needs to be looked at further.
  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/217 .
More work on the Cre-lox system reported. More work     presented on identifying biobrick parts. Backbone and fluorescent parts looked     at.
Consolidation of progress and identification of next steps     for the project.
August 7
Received very useful information from DTU regarding their     use of PlugnPlay:
“Response     from DTU:
Thank you for your interest in using our assembly     system.
The Plug'n'Play system was created in hope that iGEM     would see that they needed to change their assembly standard and the RFC-10,     and that it did but it is a slow process. Most of our parts did therefore not     comply with the RFC-10 and iGEM did not accept them. However, we had to apply     the RFC-10 to a least one part to be regarded for the gold medal. Three parts     was done with the RFC-10 and with the backbone of the shipping plasmid pSB1C3     with chloramphenicol resistance and holding the restriction site of the iGEM     assembly standard (BBa_K678002). …”
August     8
Some discrepancy found in Primers designed for some of the ALDH     promoter amplifications when final product size was compared to commercial     sequences. Primers have therefore been re-designed.

August 10
It has been brought to attention that direction of promoter     sequences needs to be confirmed prior to primers being ordered.
ALDH Promoters as they appear on their respective     genes:
1. ALDH1A1 is on the negative strand
2. ALDH3A1 is on the negative strand
3. ALDH1A3 is on the positive strand
4. ALDH2 is on the positive strand

August 16
Consolidation of results. Update of parts list.
August 17
Attendance and presentation at the iGEM UK Hangout at GOOGLE     Campus. We had the opportunity to learn a lot from the other teams and returned     from the meet newly inspired. We have a lot of work ahead of us.
August 19
Push forward with finding sponsorship. Closer look at     judging criteria, we want to aim high – Reach for GOLD!
Consolidation of Team name – iSTEM, and further     development on team identity and designing the team logo.
New roles taken up by team members.
August 23
Looked into promotion ideas and the team decided that a     promotional video is required.  Time     was spent putting forward ideas for the video.  
Push forward with finding funding and identification of     possible sponsors. We also had a discussion about Human Practice.
Protocols for the lab are being put together.
August 24
Team photo’s taken in Regent Park.
More ideas for video have been put forward and the team had     further discussion about Human Practice and how to proceed.
T-shirt design was discussed discussed and a few concepts     derived.
Big push for each of the team members to deliver results is     now on.
August 25
Started to draw up the list for reagents and consumables     needed in the Lab and filling the order forms.
August 26
Team photo’s and profile pics selected. Karin has been     looking into the safety and ethics part of the project.
August 27
Today we did filming for a promotional video. The footage     needs to be edited. The     search continues to find a sponsor for the Regional Jamoree. Requests have been     sent to 10 companies, so fingers crossed. It is a bit late in the shedual to     apply for funding, but we are hopeful. We are looking to interview a number of     University lecturers involved in Cancer research. First set of primers has been     ordered!
August 30
Went through the work flow for lab experiments. Determined     the next steps required to complete the assembly parts list. The designing of     the plugnplay primers was explained and this work needs to be done soon so that     primers can be ordered. This was recorded.
Passaging of our two cell lines was done (by Andy). This is     in preparation for optimisation of the transfection reagent which is going to     be used for the transfections. A recording to the passaging of the cells was     made.
Action Points:
Need to create a TICK list
Need to delegate wiki and computer work
Need to finalise parts list – we are obtaining parts     from DTU 2011 iGEM team.
Need to design fusion primers     and get them ordered
Need to look into mutagenisis and design all the required     primers and get them ordered ASAP
September 1
We have come across the Eukaryotic promoter Database!! They     have the ALDH isoforms which we are using in our project. Further investigation     has revealed that the promoter sequences on the site have been tested. This is     encouraging news. Analysis of our own selected sequences and that of EPD show     that ALDH1A1, ALDH2 and ALDH1A3 have significant overlap. We have designed new     primers for ALDH1A1 avoid the restriction site. Also, ALDH3A1 has multiple     promoter regions. We have therefore selected one of the EPD promoter sequences     and designed new primers. Work continues on designing primers for plug-n-play.
September 3
We have moved into the Lab!! But  we are still waiting for primers. Work     on wiki design and logo continues. Parts required from Serano have been     identified, now it’s just a matter of getting them from Barcelona!Hopefully DTU     parts will be sent tomorrow. Still waiting for primers.
September 5
The survey has been finalised and is to be posted soon. An     interview with Dr Miriam Dwek has been organised and all in the team are     looking forward to this. Andy has begun transfection optimisation using PEI.     Traven and visa requirements are being sorted. Two team members attended the     Societies of Westminster first meetup of the year. This was a great opportunity     to introduce iGEM to other student groups in the university. We received great     advice from all the groups and look forward to interacting with them over the     year.
September 6
Deadline!! on  7th.     We finally got conformation on the iGEM definition of BSc vs MSc students.     Safety questions are answered and now just need to work out how to get them     onto the wiki. We have not been able to find outside funding and the University  has generously sponsored the Registration     fee for Amsterdam. Amsterdam, here we come!!
September 7
Deadline! Fees (tick), Safety (tick), Judging (tick)
September 10
Been busy… but so much still to do. Still waiting for     primers so have been busy designing the lad procedures. We really are pressed     for time now, but all in the team are still upbeat and excited to build out     BioBricks. Linker primers have been ordered from IDT. Work has begun in     preparing for Freshers.
September 11
The interview with Miriam Dwek has gone very well. Primers     arrived late this afternoon, so we can start BioBrick building tomorrow.
September 12
It’s all systems go in the lab. First PCR to amplify out     biobricks was unsuccessful. The plan is to do a crude extraction of DNA and see     if that works.
September 13
We got one!! We have managed to amplify ALDH2 promoter. The     rest of the team continues to work on Freshers attendance and other aspects of     the project. We now need to start thinking about site directed mutagenisis!!
September 16
Been busy! Did touchdown PCR and got some bands, since then     its been PCR-Gel-PCR-Gel-Gel extract-Transform-PCR-Gel…. Love it.
September 19
We’ve been busy. There just isn’t enough time in the day.     Freshers at Marylebone was good experience. This is an arts and design campus,     so it’s been good practice in trying to engage individuals who are not     necessarily interested in science. Lab has had its ups and downs.
September 20
Freshers at Cavendish! What a great day! It’s been just the     boost the team has needed. Up to 100 students have signed up the  our mailing list and there has been much     enthusiastic interest in iGEM. Still waiting for DTU parts! Unfortunately we     really have run out of time. We are all looking forward to testing plug-n-play     though!
September 21
DTU parts have arrived. Lots to do now.
September 24
Things have been manic in the lab. Many PCR optimisations later and we are still not satisfied with our amplification of parts using our     linker primers. All very frustrating. We have tried Taq to see if  we can at least amplify the parts.     Promoter parts are ready for sending and sequencing.
