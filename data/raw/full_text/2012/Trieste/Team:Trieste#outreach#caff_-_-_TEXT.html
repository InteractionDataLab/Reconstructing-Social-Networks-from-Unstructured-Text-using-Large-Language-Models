Caffè delle Scienze - Science Café
On 13th of September, we partecipated at the opening night of the Science Café 2012/2013 edition (Italian) , held in the historical Caffé S.Marco in Trieste. It is a monthly event organized by the University of Trieste, for a wide audience. It is more than a speaking tour; the Science Café nights are in-depth meetings to discuss, in a simple way, about the latest scientific advances, in a relaxed environment sipping a cup of coffe. In this comfy atmosphere, we had the opportunity to talk and explain what Synthetic Biology is, its application in the common life and especially give voice to 'The Jolly JoCare' project!
