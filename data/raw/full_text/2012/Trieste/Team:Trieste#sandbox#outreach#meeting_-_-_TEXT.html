Meeting Trento - Trieste: the first Italian iGEM teams reunion
iGEM is more than a competition. It is a stunning experience that gives you the chance to share ideas with other iGEM teams. This is what we did. We organized a one-day meeting with the other italian iGEM team: UniTN. We presented our projects, talked about modeling, discussed about possible collaborations. We had a great time together, visiting the city and spending some relaxing time out of the lab sharing our interest and laughing at the same time. The meeting was extremely successful! For this reason we decided to meet again as soon as we can... maybe for a last rehearsal before the jamboree!
