Students
Giulia Corso
Giulia Corso (born on April 2, 1988 in Feltre, Italy)           graduated with a Biological BSc at the University of Trieste          and she is now attending the first year of Functional          Genomics Master degree.
She has a balanced personality, a friendly and soft character          easy to appreciate.  Guitar was one of her passion for many          years, she played several musical genre: from the classical          music to jazz up to bossa nova. A passion unfotunately          snuffed out like the sporty ones, volleyball and snowboard.
She has a foundamental role in the team, acting as an          invisible hand to improve the website contents,          adding elements that reflect her style.
Giulia is also the reference point for the use of english, she also spreads          the news on the networks, she keeps in touch with the          people who sent us helpful parts for our project.
Elisa Clagnan
Elisa Clagnan (born on October 3,1989 in Seregno, Italy)          graduated with a Biological BSc at the University of Trieste          and she is now attending the first year of Functional          Genomics Master degree.
Elisa is a inward-looking and reflective girl, with a          jaunty hair cut that frame her pretty roundish face. Her          deep icy blue eyes, betraying sparkles of creativity, have          made her the artistic soul of our group!
During our first brainstorming she has always dampened our enthusiasm for a          project, for this reason she has gotten the nickname "The          Critic". Thanks to her critical attitude, we were able to          discard unfeasible projects and listen at the promising ones!
Her real love is literature, mainly French and Russian authors,          who emphasize her introspective nature and her romantic          soul that she doesn't like to highlight!
Federico Colombo
Federico Colombo (born on April 12,1988 in Modica, Italy)          has obtained a BSc degree in Biological Science at the          University of Trieste, where he is now attending the first          year of the Master degree in Functional Genomics.
He is the team member who searches and reads scientific          articles both at the beginning, during the first brainstorming          and during the practical work in lab, finding solutions to          evade the problems we encounterd.
He likes playing the guitar, it helps him to chill out and          relieve tension. He also loves going skin-diving, sport          that demand the athlete more than a physical preparation,          rather a mental maturity.
He also has a unique affinity with his labmate Elisa: they          communicate softly, probably the characteristics that differ          widely them from the other 2 team groups!
Marija Drikic
Marija Drikic (born on Novemebr 29,1988 in Serbia) is          a first year Functional Genomics Master student at the          University of Trieste, where she obtained  a BSc in Biology          and Cellular and Molecular Technologies.
In the lab she is really efficient and extremely watchful;          she navigates her way through plenty of cloning on the          immunology lab counter without any problem!!  If you are          getting crazy doing calculations, ask her for help and in          two seconds she will tell you the right answer you were          hardly looking for.
She is veeeeeery patient with her labmate Giorgio! If you          cross the door of their lab, you will hear Marija laughing          because of some mistake that Giorgio made.
Fortunately, she is not perfect. As all of us she has her          Achilles heel: reaching the tallest solutions is still          an obstacle for her and most of all orienting around the          Research Institute!!!
Giorgio Gargari
Giorgio Gargari ( born on October 2, 1988 in Torino, Italy)          graduated with a Biological BSc at the University of Trieste          and he is now attending the first year of Functional Genomics          Master degree.
Black and wild hair, black and deep eyes. He has lot          of patience and he always tries to keep peace among the          team members.          Working with him in the lab is always funny. He is able to          transform a bad day in a funny one, thanks to his joyful mood.
He is a gym lover, obsessed by his body eating lot of proteins          and plenty of vitamin supplements instead of freshy fruits          and veggies.          His drawback: everybody agrees that he has bad taste in          matching colors!!
Sara Samari
Sara Samari ( born on February 23, 1989 in Gorizia,Italy)          got a Biological BSc at the University of Trieste and          she is attending the first year of Functional Genomics          Master degree.
She is an hyperactive, energic, outgoing and self-deprecating          girl. She has the classic determined and resolute personality          of the leader, that helped the team during the months!!
She is our outreach manager, an essential role in the team,          that gave us the possibilities to organise plenty of events          to spread the SynBio knowledge in Trieste.
Photography is her passion, every picture from our website          was made with her Canon; every photo was made with passion          and competence, thanks to her devotion to this hobby.          She became a vegetarian more than a year ago, denying herself          the taste of meat, because she believes that human beings could          easily live, without killing animals to satisfy their hunger.
Aljaž Srebrnič
Aljaž Srebrnič (born on September 28, 1990 in Gorizia,Italy)          graduated from high school with qualifications in Informatics          and now studying for Physics BSc at the University of Trieste.
Aljaž is an hyperactive and joyful guy with many many hobbies!          Scout is one of them; he teaches the children the survival          techniques in the wild forest and they tenderly call him          "Wise Bear".  He loves robotics and he likes to be          surrounded by curious gadgets as his watch "EZ Chronos", upon          which he coded and installed the operating system by himself.
Aljaž has a completely different background from the other          members of the team. He is the geek of the group!! He is not          well up on biology, but he has a passion for engineering and IT.
