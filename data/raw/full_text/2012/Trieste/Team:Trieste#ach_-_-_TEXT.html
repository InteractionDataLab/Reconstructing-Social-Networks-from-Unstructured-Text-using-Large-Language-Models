We believe our team deserves the
Gold medal because we met the following criteria:
Requirements for a Bronze Medal
We registered our team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Regional Jamboree.
We successfully completed and submitted this iGEM 2012 Judging form.
We created and shared a description of the team's project using the iGEM wiki and the team's parts using the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.
We planned to present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.
We entered information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Including:
Primary nucleic acid sequence
Description of function;
Authorship;
Safety notes, if relevant;
Acknowledgment of sources and references;
We submitted DNA for at least one new BioBrick Part or Device to the Registry.
Requirements for a Silver Medal
We demonstrated that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; we characterized the operation of your new part/device..
We entered this information and other documentation on the part's 'Main Page' section of the Registry Part Numbers:
BBa_K875001
BBa_K875002
BBa_K875003
BBa_K875004
BBa_K875005
BBa_K875006
BBa_K875007
BBa_K875008
BBa_K875009
Requirements for a Gold Medal
We improve an existing BioBrick Part or Device and entered this information back on the Experience Page of the Registry.
BBa_K875020 that replace the non functional BBa_K392008
We helped another iGEM team bringing them last year experience.
We outline and detailed a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation. Link to this information on our wiki
