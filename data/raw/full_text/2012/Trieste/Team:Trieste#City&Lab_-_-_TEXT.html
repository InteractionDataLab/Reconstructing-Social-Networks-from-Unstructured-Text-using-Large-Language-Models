Trieste
Trieste is the chief town of Friuli Venezia Giulia: Autonomous Region among the European Union most advanced areas focussed on innovation and internationalisation. Trieste hosts three universities (SISSA, UNITS, MIB) and a high number of national and international research bodies. Nowadays in Friuli Venezia Giulia there are over 8 researchers for every 1,000 inhabitants, reaching the same standard of United States. Trieste is also famous for its huge cultural and artistic heritage among which the Miramare Castle, the Synagogue of Trieste, the Verdi Theatre and last but not least the Piazza Unità d’Italia, the Europe's largest square facing the sea.
University of Trieste
The University of Trieste (UNITS) consists of 12 faculties that cover a wide range of courses and currently has about 23,000 students enrolled and 1,000 professors. This middle-sized university is a relatively young Institution (80 years old) strongly oriented towards innovation and internationalisation. It boasts a growing network of international inter-university co-operation agreements and in this sparkling environment the wish to participate at IGEM has been well accepted. In 2011 the University of Trieste was evaluated by the Times Higher Education European University Rankings in the top 226-250 European University and the 5th in Italy.

The Department of Life Sciences of Trieste University, in addition to its role as an important centre of learning and education, is also a dynamic centre at the forefront of scientific and technological research.  It is fully integrated within the University science network, requiring interdisciplinarity amongst different sectors and capacity to elaborate integrated forms of knowledge, which is increasingly necessary to understand complex systems and to develop creativity.
The Researchers in the Department of Life Sciences collaborate with over 50 academic and industrial foreign institutions, with several leading National Research Laboratories and Universities.
