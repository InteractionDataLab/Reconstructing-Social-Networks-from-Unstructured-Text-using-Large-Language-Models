Background
The human intestinal microflora is considered an essential “organ”      which plays an important role in human health. This complex ecosystem      is composed of approximately 500 anaerobic and aerobic bacteria species,      most of them localized in large intestine.
Many studies on animals      bred under germ-free conditions have shown that microflora has specific      functions:
Metabolic: fermentation of non-digestible dietary residue and        endogenous mucus, salvage of energy as short-chain fatty acids,        production of vitamin K, absorption of ions;
Trophic: control of epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation;        development and homoeostasis of the immune system;
Protective: protection against pathogens.
A disruption or an alteration of human gut microflora equilibrium leads      to severe auto-immune diseases, types of colon cancer and non-allergic      food hypersensitivities; therefore, it is very important to keep its      integrity.  In fact already a century ago, the first probiotics have      been commercialized. Probiotics are bacteria species (normally present      in human gut) that are administered as food components or supplements.      Nowadays, with the emerging research field of synthetic biology the      potential applications of probiotics could further increase. In addition,      the introduction of novel functions to this “organ” via probiotics      could lead the way to new therapeutics in order to cure or prevent many      pathological conditions.
Project overview
We engineered an indigenous strain from the gut microflora in order to      create a safe, controllable and versatile molecular platform, which can      be used for production of a wide range of molecules.  For this purpose      we used the Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (commercialized as      Mutaflor) as the host organism for our platform. This particular strain      has been used as a probiotic for decades and its beneficial effects      on human health are well documented. We introduced into the strain a      gene guard system based on an inducible cumate gene guard switch and we      trasformed it with a particularly designed plasmid for protein expression.
The gene guard system is divided in two parts:
the killing mechanism
the regulating pattern
The killing mechanism is placed on the  same plasmid used for protein     expression. It consists of two different proteins, T4 Holin [1] and     Cathelicidin LL-37 [2] ,     both toxic for prokaryotic cells. These antimicrobial     proteins are both regulated by a cumate responsive promoter (T5 promoter     Cumate Operator [3] [4] )     placed upstream the structural genes. Holin is the     biobrick BBa_K112000 designed by group iGEM08 UC Berkeley. This protein     comes from bacteriophage T4; it is a small membrane protein which     depolarizes and permeabilizes the membrane allowing the secretion of     Cathelicidin LL-37 to the periplasm. Cathelicidin LL-37 is an antimicrobial     peptide produced by human macrophages. It has an amphypathic structure     that allows it to associate with bacterial membrane and form pores which     lead to cell lysis; its presence in the periplasm is pivotal for its     killing effect. As an alternative killing mechanism the complex T4 Holin +     Cathelicidin LL-37 can be replaced with TSE 2 toxin, a standard biobrick     BBa_K314200 designed and characterized by Group iGEM10 Washington. TSE     2 arrests the bacterial growth.
The cumate-responsive regulator CymR [3] [4] ,     which regulates the expression of the T4 Holin and Cathelicidin LL-37,     will be introduced into the bacterial chromosome by recombination using     the UPO-Sevilla miniTn7 Biobrick together with the helper plasmid pTNS2     which codes for the Tn7 transposase.  The regulator cassette consists     of a constitutive promoter (J23100) and the cymR gene, put in tandem     in order to increase the quantity of the repressor  to tightly control     toxin expression.
No Cumate Expression Mode:
CymR is continuously produced. It binds the cumate responsive promoter (T5 Cumate Operator) and inhibits the expression of T4 Holin and Cathelicidin LL-37.
Bacteria live!
Cumate-Induction Kill Mode:
Cumate enters by diffusion into bacteria, binds and inactivates the     repressor. The cumate responsive promoter (T5 Cumate Operator) is     derepressed and the expression of T4 Holin and Cathelicidin LL-37     is turned on. T4 Holin interacts with the cytoplasmatic membrane,     permeabilizes it allowing the secretion of Cathelicidin LL-37 into the     periplasmic space. Cathelicidin LL-37 binds the outermembrane and forms     pores, which leads to cell lysis.
Bacteria die!
Plasmid Transfer:
The plasmid transfers from the E. coli Nissle into other bacteria         via horizontal transfer. The receiving bacteria do not produce         the CymR repressor, so the cumate responsive promoter (T5 Cumate         Operator) is derepressed and the T4 Holin and Cathelicidin         LL-37 expression is activated.
Receiving bacteria die!
E. coli Nissle looses the plasmid. It continues to produce the         CymR repressor, which does not appear to be toxic for prokaryotic         cells.
Bacteria live and are harmless!
