Beyond the Lab -  Activities we Achieved to Improve the Knowledge of SynBio
The social network made by iGemmers for iGemmers...
Talking about SynBio in an old cafè like scientists few centuries ago...
Our favorite University Free press & Blog gave us the space to spread Synbio...
European Innovation and Science Research Forum... COMING SOON 28-30/09
Last year team's idea finally become real! The first Italian iGEM meeting with UNITN team, a really intensive and hot day!...
Our first event!! "Ladies and gentlemen here our project!"...
During one of the party organized by our University's student union, we had an interview on "Radio in Corso", a University radio. We explained what iGEM and the SynBio are.
The week before "Trieste Next" event, we recieved a call-interview from RadioAttività. They asked us some questions about our iGEM experience and the activities that we organized for Trieste Next forum.
