Spreading SynBio with '''il Tascapane''' - The university Free press & blog
During the UniVillage event we had the opportunity to realize that really little is known about Sinthetic Biology while general biology and biotechnology topics seems to be widespread among university students.
For this reason we decided to create a partnership with our University free-press: Il tascapane. The printed journal reach all the 20.000 students of the city and the blog virtually any Italian-speaking person around the world.
Thanks to Carolina Venturoli, the editor of our favorite journal, we had the possibility to have a column dedicated to synthetic biology:
August: What is SynBio (Italian)
September: Synbio and Medicine (Italian)
September: SynBio and drug development (Italian)
