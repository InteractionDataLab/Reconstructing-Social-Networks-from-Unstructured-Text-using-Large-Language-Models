The safe probiotic constructed here can be used to produce nutritious,       preventive or therapeutic molecules. For example, this E.coli can       express antitumorals, antibodies against different intestinal pathogens,       imunomodulators, antigens (recombinant proteins which act as mucosal       vaccine) which are important for the correct development of the immune       system etc. It can express also different enzymes as lactase or enzymes       needed to recreate the metabolic pathways to produce nutrients such       as vitamins.
To give a proof-of-concept, we have used our safe probiotic to deliver       to gut mucosa a neutralizing antibody (Ab 54.6) [1] against an emerging       Norovirus (NoV), one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis in the       world. To this end, we used a LPP-OmpA based cell display system [2] to       express the scFv (single chain fragment variable) format of the antibody       attached to the bacterial surface. According to the literature, scFvs       anchored to the bacterial surface can bind multiple viral particles       and protect efficiently against infection. The chosen scFv sequence,       which was already known to inhibit Norovirus (NoV) interaction with       cells, was inserted in frame downstream the LPP-OmpA sequence and       this construct was cloned under a constitutive promoter. LPP-OmpA is a       chimeric sequence having part of the major outer membrane lipoprotein       and an outer membrane porin OmpA fragment. This chimeric sequence acts       as a leader sequence and an anchor, it transports the scFv fused at its       C-terminus through the cytoplasm membrane into the periplasm, where the       scFv assumes the right conformation. OmpA portion then introduces itself       into the outer membrane displaying extracellularly its C terminus with       the Ab attached on.
The anti-NoV antibody was also expressed as a SIP       (Small Immuno Protein) format, which contains the scFv fused to the CH3       domain of the heavy chain of human immunoglobulin A (IgA). Since the       CH3 region is able to homodimerize, it should confer bivalent binding       properties to the anti-NoV scFv54.6. Secreted SIPs have the dual advantage       of being bivalent as full-length antibodies and being small as scFvs. They       have also been shown to have the potential to protect against enteric       infections when administered orally [3] . Eventually, we planned to produce also the secreted versions of the anti-NoV SIP       54.6 and of the scFv 54.6. Both the scFv and the SIP sequences were       cloned downstream the pelB leader sequence. PelB drives proteins into the       periplasmic space, where it is cleaved off. The resulting proteins can       be released into the extracellular space by passing through porins. This       system can also be used for production of small, soluble molecules.
