Suicide System
We tried to complete the construct, cloning the LL 37 construct inside the Holin ones, but unfortunately we didn't obtain positive colonies.
Antibody
The hybridoma producing a new neutralizing scFv against norovirus arrived. We extracted its mRNA and recuperated its cDNA. We cloned VL and VH fragments into a sequencing plasmid and now we are waiting to the sequences to arrive. Our hope is to compare two scFv and determine which binds better norovirus VLPs.
Cumate-Switch Regulation
CymR
We tried several times to clone the single J23100-CymR-B0015 Eco/Pst into the plasmid K510012 but we didn't have positive colonies.
