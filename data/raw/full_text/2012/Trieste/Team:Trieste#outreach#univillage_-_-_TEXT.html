UniVillage: Trieste iGEM team 2012 : Here we are!
Usually the libraries are always packed with studious students, but    during UniVillage, a two-day event arranged by our University’s student    union. The libraries turn into a stage where students and professor attend    theatrical performance, talks, debates, happy hour, concerts and dj set.
In this scenario, we had the opportunity to expose our iGEM project    and discuss about synthetic biology with a wide set of students, asking    them what they know and think about it. Lots of them knew nothing of the    matter, but they seemed really interested in knowing more about SynBio    and its world.With this in mind we decided to have a SynBio column in    “Il Tascapane”, our University blog.
