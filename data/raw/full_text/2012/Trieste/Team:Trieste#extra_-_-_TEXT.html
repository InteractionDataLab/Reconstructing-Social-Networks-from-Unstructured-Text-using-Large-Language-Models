Last year team, that also established the iGEM team in our university, demonstrated that a project can be fully designed and achieved by students.
Following their example, we decided to bring part to this year edition with the same spirit. After a suitable training and thanks to precious advice of our instructors and advisors we were able to reach that goal. iGEM is a unique opportunity of enrichment and we wanted to get the maximum learning by making mistakes helped us to fully understand how to face problems.
We always kept in mind last year motto: "The project is made of 'undergraduate' thoughts and it has to be realized by 'undergraduate' hands!"
Since January we met everyday after lesson and we tried to find an appropriated idea for the iGEM competition and we also sought for sponsorship to make our project real.
We avoided any kind of hierarchy and decided to put on the blackboard all the tasks we had to due and let anyone improve the project with every kind of idea, during the brainstorming. Finally we got an idea and everybody worked hard to refine the construct, that was completely designed by all of us.
All the website contents you can find in the wiki, were entirely written by the team members.
The safety and all the plenty of forms were filled in by the team members.
The Wiki was entirely designed by the team, with some good advices about the layout.
The video and the logo was drawn in pencil and completely digitalized by the team. All the members improved on it with continuous advices to make it better.
All the photos uploaded on the wiki were taken by the team members with phones, cameras and professional camera!!
We conceived and created since the beginning, 'socialiGEM' the social network for igemmers only.
We did a really hard work concerning the Human Practice : we organized and participated in plenty of events and most of all we were invited to represent our University at the European Innovation and Science Research Forum "Trieste Next".
