									Giulia Corso (born on April 2, 1988 in Feltre, Italy) 
									graduated with a Biological BSc at the University of Trieste
									and she is now attending the first year of Functional
									Genomics Master degree.
								</P><P>
									She has a balanced personality, a friendly and soft character
									easy to appreciate.  Guitar was one of her passion for many
									years, she played several musical genre: from the classical
									music to jazz up to bossa nova. A passion unfotunately
									snuffed out like the sporty ones, volleyball and snowboard.
								</P><P>
									She has a foundamental role in the team, acting as an
									invisible hand to improve the website contents,
									adding elements that reflect her style.
									Giulia is also the reference point for the use of english, she also spreads
									the news on the networks, she keeps in touch with the
									people who sent us helpful parts for our project.
								</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><H2>Elisa Clagnan</H2></TD><TD><P>
									Elisa Clagnan (born on October 3,1989 in Seregno, Italy)
									graduated with a Biological BSc at the University of Trieste
									and she is now attending the first year of Functional
									Genomics Master degree.
								</P><P>
									Elisa is a inward-looking and reflective girl, with a
									jaunty hair cut that frame her pretty roundish face. Her
									deep icy blue eyes, betraying sparkles of creativity, have
									made her the artistic soul of our group!
								</P><P>
									During our first brainstorming she has always dampened our enthusiasm for a
									project, for this reason she has gotten the nickname &quot;The
									Critic&quot;. Thanks to her critical attitude, we were able to
									discard unfeasible projects and listen at the promising ones!
									Her real love is literature, mainly French and Russian authors,
									who emphasize her introspective nature and her romantic
									soul that she doesn't like to highlight!
								</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><H2>Federico Colombo</H2></TD><TD><P>
									Federico Colombo (born on April 12,1988 in Modica, Italy)
									has obtained a BSc degree in Biological Science at the
									University of Trieste, where he is now attending the first
									year of the Master degree in Functional Genomics.
								</P><P>
									He is the team member who searches and reads scientific
									articles both at the beginning, during the first brainstorming
									and during the practical work in lab, finding solutions to
									evade the problems we encounterd.
								</P><P>
									He likes playing the guitar, it helps him to chill out and
									relieve tension. He also loves going skin-diving, sport
									that demand the athlete more than a physical preparation,
									rather a mental maturity.
									He also has a unique affinity with his labmate Elisa: they
									communicate softly, probably the characteristics that differ
									widely them from the other 2 team groups!
								</P></TD></TR><TR><TD><H2>Marija Drikic</H2></TD><TD><P>
									Marija Drikic (born on Novemebr 29,1988 in Serbia) is
									a first year Functional Genomics Master student at the
									University of Trieste, where she obtained  a BSc in Biology
									and Cellular and Molecular Technologies.
								</P><P>
									In the lab she is really efficient and extremely watchful;
									she navigates her way through plenty of cloning on the
									immunology lab counter without any problem!!  If you are
									getting crazy doing calculations, ask her for help and in
									two seconds she will tell you the right answer you were
									hardly looking for.
									She is veeeeeery patient with her labmate Giorgio! If you
									cross the door of their lab, you will hear Marija laughing
									because of some mistake that Giorgio made.
								</P><P>
									Fortunately, she is not perfect. As all of us she has her
									Achilles heel: reaching the tallest solutions is still
									an obstacle for her and most of all orienting around the
									Research Institute!!!

									Giorgio Gargari ( born on October 2, 1988 in Torino, Italy)
									graduated with a Biological BSc at the University of Trieste

									Master degree.
								</P><P>
									Black and wild hair, black and deep eyes. He has lot
									of patience and he always tries to keep peace among the
									team members.
									Working with him in the lab is always funny. He is able to
									transform a bad day in a funny one, thanks to his joyful mood.
								</P><P>
									He is a gym lover, obsessed by his body eating lot of proteins
									and plenty of vitamin supplements instead of freshy fruits
									and veggies.
									His drawback: everybody agrees that he has bad taste in
									matching colors!!

									Sara Samari ( born on February 23, 1989 in Gorizia,Italy)
									got a Biological BSc at the University of Trieste and
									she is attending the first year of Functional Genomics
									Master degree.
								</P><P>
									She is an hyperactive, energic, outgoing and self-deprecating
									girl. She has the classic determined and resolute personality
									of the leader, that helped the team during the months!!
								</P><P>									
									She is our outreach manager, an essential role in the team,
									that gave us the possibilities to organise plenty of events
									to spread the SynBio knowledge in Trieste.
								</P><P>
									Photography is her passion, every picture from our website
									was made with her Canon; every photo was made with passion
									and competence, thanks to her devotion to this hobby.
									She became a vegetarian more than a year ago, denying herself
									the taste of meat, because she believes that human beings could
									easily live, without killing animals to satisfy their hunger.

									AljaÅ¾ is an hyperactive and joyful guy with many many hobbies!
									Scout is one of them; he teaches the children the survival
									techniques in the wild forest and they tenderly call him
									&quot;Wise Bear&quot;.  He loves robotics and he likes to be
									surrounded by curious gadgets as his watch &quot;EZ Chronos&quot;, upon
									which he coded and installed the operating system by himself.
								</P><P>
									AljaÅ¾ has a completely different background from the other
									members of the team. He is the geek of the group!! He is not
									well up on biology, but he has a passion for engineering and IT.
