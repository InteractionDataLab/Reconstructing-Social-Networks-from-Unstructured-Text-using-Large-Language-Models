Meeting Trieste - Trento

Meeting Trieste - Trento: the first Italian iGEM teams reunion
Cooperation first of all! iGEM is more than a competition. It is a stunning experience that gives you       the chance to share ideas with other iGEM teams. This is what we did. We       organized a one-day meeting with the other italian iGEM team: UniTN. We       presented our projects, talked about modeling, discussed about possible       collaborations. We had a great time together, visiting the city and spending       some relaxing time out of the lab sharing our interest and laughing at the       same time. The meeting was extremely successful! For this reason we decided to       meet again as soon as we can... maybe for a last rehearsal before the jamboree!
