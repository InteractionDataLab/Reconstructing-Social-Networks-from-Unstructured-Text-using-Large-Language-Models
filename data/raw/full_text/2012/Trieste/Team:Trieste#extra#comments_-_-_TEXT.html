A very short time with several things to do: this is iGEM! An amazing                 experience that every student should live during his studies.
iGEM helps you to become independent in all the steps that research requires, it is an opportunity to grow as a person, an experience that enriches and changes the perception of science that surrounds us.
The Jolly JoCare was entirely created by us, 7 motivated students with a will to learn as much as we can from this experience.
After plenty of brainstorming since January, we gave birth to our project in May. We completely and passionately dedicated our time to make The Jolly JoCare  project real.
We did not stop here, we also spread  the SynBio knowledge around us involving people of all ages.
These paragraphs have been written to convey our feelings of what these months meant for all of us.
We hope you will enjoy The Jolly JoCare!!
