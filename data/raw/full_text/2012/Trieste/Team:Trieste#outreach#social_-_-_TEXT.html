SocialiGEM - The Registry of Standard Igemmers & Co.
Communicate and collaborate! This is not only a goal but also a need for the igemmers during the competition. To improve the results that could be reach but also to have a brake and some fun with people that share the same interests. A lot of social network already exist but if they are not centered on a topic it could be possible to lose an announcement or make confusion with other alerts. For this reason we decided to create the standard registry of igemmers, open to all students, advisors, instructors and alumni. We count already counted plenty of adesions from all over the world So come and join us on SocialiGEM !
