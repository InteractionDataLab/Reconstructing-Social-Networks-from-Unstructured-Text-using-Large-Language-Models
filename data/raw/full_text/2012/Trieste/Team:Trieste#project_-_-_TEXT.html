Background
Recent studies have evidenced that the intestinal microflora can    actually be considered an organ of the body. It has several functions    in the human gut, mostly metabolic and immunologic, and it constantly    interacts with the intestinal mucosa in a delicate equilibrium. It    is therefore believed that having a beneficial and healthy intestinal    microflora is very important for human health.
Project
Our aim is to modify a bacteria normally found in human gut and create    a safe, controllable and versatile molecular platform which can be used    to produce a wide range of molecules (as for example other antibodies    or enzymes) leading to a beneficial probiotic.
For this purpose we have chosen the E. coli strain Nissle 1917 which has been    used for many years as a probiotic. We designed a robust gene guard system    regulated by a novel and easy to control inducible switch that activates    the production of a human antimicrobial peptide that can kill the bacteria    and also avoid horizontal transfer.
Our gene guard system is based on the cumate molecule present in the common    spice: cumin. In absence of this molecule our system produces a repressor    (CymR) which inhibits the expression of an antimicrobial peptide. When    administered and therefore present in human intestine, cumin recognizes and    disables the CymR repressor  resulting in the production of  the antimicrobial    peptide  cathelicidin LL-37 which causes bacterial death. In case of plasmid    transfer into other bacteria of the plasmid carrying the expression system,    the expression of the antimicrobial peptide will be activated immediately    because the receiving bacteria do not produce the CymR repressor needed to    repress the expression of the antimicrobial peptide.
Application
The safe probiotic constructed here can be used to produce nutritious,    preventive or therapeutic molecules. For example, we have used it to    produce an antibody against the emerging virus called Norovirus; this    virus which has a dramatic spreading speed: rates of reported Norovirus    outbreaks reach 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis per year,    70.000 of those need hospitalization and 800 die.
