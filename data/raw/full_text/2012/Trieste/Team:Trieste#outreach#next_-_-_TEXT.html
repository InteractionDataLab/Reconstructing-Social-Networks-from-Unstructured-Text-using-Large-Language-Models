Trieste Next
Venice and Northeastern Italy will apply in 2019 for the “European Capital of Culture” title. For this reason, Trieste organised the event "Trieste Next" where common people are approached to science. The programme consists of meetings, keynote speeches by distinguished speakers as Beachy Roger (Former Director of the National Institute for Food and Agriculture), Darnton Robert (Director of the University Library at Harvard), Davidson Nick (Deputy Secretary General of the Ramsar Convention), Hack Margherita (Italian astrophysicist and popular science writer), Illy Andrea (chairman and CEO of illycaffè S.p.A.- a family coffee business founded in Trieste), Giacca Mauro (Director, ICGEB Trieste Component). We all are surrounded by science everywhere, on our tables and in the meal we daily make! We will give people the chance of entering in this world, where food and science are tightly related with one another. Together we will transform boring experiments in funny games which everyone children, teenagers and adults can grasp to feel the flavour of science....
