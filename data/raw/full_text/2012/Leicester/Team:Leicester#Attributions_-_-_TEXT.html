30th August: Produced some dNTP's. Made the master mix for the PCR. Programmed the PCR block.
31st August: Cut the DNA out of the PCR gel. Looked at the 01#502 plates for signs of new growth.
4th September: Discussed options for engineering a BioBrick. Set up PCR.
10th September: Checked the primers from Friday.
12th September: Tested the gel extraction kit using a 1kb DNA ladder.
18th September: Sequenced the samples produced.
25th September: Checked all the teams work on the wiki, making sure everything is ready to be published.

15th August: Suggested further steps to be taken in the genomic tip, showed Will how to use the Nanodrop spectrometer.
22nd August: Showed Chris how to use the Nanodrop spectrometer.
31st August: Suggested changes to the Sau3A1 for a better gel.
4th September: Discussed options for engineering a BioBrick.
24st September: Supervised the nanodrop.

    Sue Hardy (Lab technician)
29th July: Plated up some ''E. coli'' for the team to use.
5th August: Produced the overnight cultures of ''E. coli'' for the team to use.
    Alex (Researcher)
16th July: Got the glass beads to try and smash the polystyrene sugar.
    Carlo (Researcher)
16th July: Brought the team liquid nitrogen and showed us how to use it safely.
    Pseudomonas researcher - Jaspreet Sahota
18th July: Plated out the control, 5% and 10% polystyrene plates with 5 strains of ''Pseudomonas''.
    Sarah Curtis
Sent us the 01#502 CSE kit, that we isolated a positive bacteria from. Thanks, Sarah.
