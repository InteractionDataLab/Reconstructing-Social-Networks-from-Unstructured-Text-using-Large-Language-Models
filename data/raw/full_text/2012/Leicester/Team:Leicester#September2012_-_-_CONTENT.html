</DIV><H3 class="calendar">   Monday 3rd September 2012</H3><DIV class="day"><P>(11:00 am) Some of the team calculated the concentration of 16s extracted DNA to be run on an agarose gel and later for sequencing. The calculations allow the most efficient use of the DNA stock.</P><P>(14:00 pm) 2μl of DNA were added for samples 3, 4, 5 and 6 whereas 4μl of sample 2 DNA were added due to the stock concentration being lower. The amount of marker added was varied, which allowed the concentration of samples to be determined and the accuracy of the nano-drop spectrophotometry to be checked.</P><P>(15:45 pm) The gel was loaded as:</P><P>X</P><P>X</P><P>Marker (4μl) </P><P>2 (4μl) </P><P>3 (2μl) </P><P>4 (2μl) </P><P>Marker (2μl) </P><P>5 (2μl) </P><P>6 (2μl) </P><P>Marker (1μl) </P><P>X</P><P>X</P><P>X</P><P>X</P><P>The gel was then run for 1 and a half hours.</P><P>(16:30 pm) A group meeting was held to inform the supervisors of how the project has progressed and discuss a detailed plan for the 4th September. Plans for the future of the project were also discussed.</P><P>(17:30 pm) The gel was then transilluminated (pictured below) and the concentration of the DNA was determined for use in sequencing tomorrow (4th September 2012).</P><DIV align="center"><P style="font-size:10px;"> Although quite faint, the bands from the 16S are present</P></DIV><P>(09:00 am) Although some colonies from the growth curve experiment could be counted, but in general there was too much growth.</P><P>(09:15 am) The group worked on the wiki for the rest of the day, writing up the past weeks work, making sure all the details were correct and in the right order, and then attributing the members as required.</P></DIV><H3 class="calendar">   Tuesday 4th September 2012</H3><DIV class="day"><P>(09:00 am) In preparation for a meeting later in the day, members of the lab discussed pathways involved in polystyrene degradation. </P><P>(11:00 am) A meeting was held with supervisors discussing the next steps of the project, with hopes to try and engineer a BioBrick. It is suspected that genes involved in toluene degradation such as TodX, TodC1&amp;2, TobA&amp;B and others present in the TOD operon may also be involved in the pathway for polystyrene degradation.</P><P>(12:00 pm) Databases containing genomic sequencing and BLAST were searched to find bacteria that used proteins similar to those discussed above for PCR. Although <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> didn’t have any of the genes, <I>Pseudomonas putida</I> F1 had them all.</P><P>(15:00 pm) With the help of a supervisor, one member of the team set up a PCR reaction for 16S DNA to increase the amount of DNA in the forward and reverse directions (in separate tubes) ready for sequencing tomorrow. </P><P>Yellow and Orange colonies were plated out and 01#502 was streaked again. This allows fresh colonies to be maintained, ready for storage at the end of the project.</P><P>(16:00 pm) The wiki was updated and BLAST searching for candidate genes continued. </P><P>(09:00 am) An early start with no set experiment today. Two of the colonies were plated out to see if they are two forms of the same bacteria or simply two separate species. This required plates being made, then individual colonies picked out to streak them. Once finished it was a day working on modelling, writing protocol and other computer work before checking the results of the plates in the late afternoon.</P><P>(16:00 pm) Some spec readings were taken of the MMP broth, with the blank just being MM broth. At 600nm wavelength the results came back for the mixed culture as 0.334, and the orange culture as 0.6.</P></DIV><H3 class="calendar">   Wednesday 5th September 2012</H3><DIV class="day"><P>(14:00 pm) A meeting was held to share the achievements of each individual section of the project (modelling, lab work and chemistry). Job roles were assigned to each person to complete in labs and on the computer modelling.</P><P>(16:30 pm) More polystyrene minimal media plates were prepared, ready for plating out some colonies from CSE kits, to see whether more positive results can be obtained from other samples.</P><P>(17:00 pm) Minimal media was made from minimal broth.</P><P>(17:05 pm) The Boilate was set up with a sample of our unknown bacteria to extract the DNA, ready to set an overnight PCR reaction so that we can sequence the 16S ribosome later on this week.</P><P>(17:20 pm) The master mix was prepared for 14 PCR reactions. 270μl of the master mix was made up, enough for aliquoting 18μl into 15 reactions.</P><P>The reaction mixture contained: </P>
171μl PCR H<SUB>2</SUB>0
 60μl HF buffer
 6μl dNTP's
 15μl Primer A 28f AAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAGA
 15μl Primer B 519R GWATTACCGCGGCKGCTG
 Template DNA to be added later as it is not PCR clean 
 3μl DNA Pol
<P>DNApol is stored in glycerol and required mixing and spinning down for a second. The remainder of the dNTPs were disposed of as they should not be freeze/thawed many times.  In the PCR hood, the master mix was aliquotted into 9 separate PCR eppendorfs with 18μl in each and the negative control prepared using PCR clean H20. The tubes were then taken to the bench where the DNA and diluted bacteria were added. 2μl of all samples were added to make a final volume of 20μl, including the positive and negative controls (see gel lane organization).</P> PCR Cycle program used was iGEM16S which is as follows:
98 degrees C - 5 min
<I>98 degrees C - 30 seconds
50 degrees C - 30 seconds
72 degrees C - 2 minutes</I>72 degrees C - 5 minutes
15 degrees C - Forever ( this is for the end of the reaction)
<P>Also the teams organic chemists have been designing a number of mechanisms. The mechanism below shows the final synthesis after much improvements. It shows the conversion of the monomer styrene being converted to lactic acid. A company called styrofoam specialise in polymerising lactic acid for easy environental breakdown. We think this route may be a viable synthetic route however due to the nature of the reagents used and conditions, there are other routes to look in to.
</P></DIV><H3 class="calendar">   Thursday 6th September 2012</H3><DIV class="day"><P>(09:00 am) A 2% agarose gel was prepared to run the PCR products on. One member of the team updated the project Wiki page. Attempts were made to track down the P. putida F1 strain which has possibly been located.</P><P>(09:40 am) The gel was poured and left to set. 5μl of loading dye was added to the PCR products ready to run on the gel.</P><P>(11:15 am) The gel was loaded and run at 120 volts.

</P><P>The Sau3AI partial digest was prepared. The experiment was run for 30 minutes as from the last test the only lanes which were digested enough were the times 5-15 minutes. A &quot;no enzyme&quot; control was also run.</P><P>(12:30 pm) Following the results of sequencing the 16S ribosomal DNA, a BLAST Search was conducted to find the genus of the bacteria cultured from the 01#502 CSE kit, which turned out to be a Pseudomonas of unknown species.</P><P>(13:20 pm) The agarose gel was stopped and a photo obtained from the transilluminator:</P><DIV align="center"><P style="font-size:10px;">The x10<SUP>-2</SUP> and lower dilutions showed no bands, but the 0 dilution and x10<SUP>-1</SUP> dilutions worked well</P></DIV><P>The PCR was repeated overnight with the x10-1 orange dilution and the 0 yellow dilution with 5μl of each as the amount recovered from this gel may not be enough for the sequencing. There were two different coloured bacteria growing and this was conducted to distinguish if these are two different species of bacteria or the same one with a different morphology of colony.</P><P>To see how much DNA can be recovered, a QIAGEN gel extraction was performed and more DNA amplified overnight.</P><P>A gel was prepared for the Sau3AI digest which has completed. </P><P>(15:10 pm) The gel was cut and the samples of DNA removed and weighed. The QG buffer was added at x6 the amount in μl of the amount of agarose there was. The samples were placed in the 50 degree incubator and vortexed every 2 minutes to dissolve the agarose. </P><P>(15:30 pm) Unfortunately, the Sau3AI digest was carried out at 37 degrees rather than the intended room temperature which might have produced better bands. Therefore, the experiment was repeated. However, the gel was still run to obtain results and confirm the need to reduce the activity of the enzyme.
Spectrophotometric analysis was conducted for the experiment set up on the 31st, after 2 day's extra growth; mmb with 5% poly resulted in OD600 mixed = 0.053 at a 10x dilution, 0.53 at 1x dilution. Orange was 0.072 at a x10 dilution, 0.72 with no dilution. This was higher than previous demonstrating that the bacteria was growing in the broth with no other carbon other than sugar beads at 5% concentration. To confirm this the experiment, it will be repeated with more controls totalling at 8 tubes. </P><P>(16:00 pm) A gel was loaded using the Sau3AI digest from earlier, the DNA was extracted from the earlier electrophoresis using a QIAGEN QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit and the wiki protocol was updated. </P><P>(16:30 pm) The Boilate was prepared for PCR overnight using the 16S yellow and orange colonies. Only the 5 neat yellow cultures and 5 x10-1 orange cultures will undergo PCR as these seemed to be the best. Unfortunately, it seems that there will not be enough DNA to sequence. </P><P>(17:15 pm) The Boilate was finished: centrifuging and then removing the supernatant. Dilutions were prepared while the master mix for PCR was prepared in the PCR hood. </P><P>(17:30 pm) The Sau3A1 digest was then transilluminated: </P><DIV align="center"><P style="font-size:10px;">Lane organisation is: x, x, 5 µl GeneRuler 1kb DNA ladder, No DNA, DNA without Sau3A1, DNA at 0 minutes, DNA at 5 minutes, DNA at 10 minutes, DNA at 15 minutes, DNA at 20 minutes, DNA at 25, DNA at 30 minutes, x, 10 µl GeneRuler 1kb DNA ladder, x, x. Notice the smooth downward trend. The expansions in the lane size we think are due to inproper mixing.</P></DIV><P>(17:45 pm) The DNA was added to the samples ready for PCR. The program used was the iGEM16S which progresses as follows:

Prep for the Sau3A1 digest at room temperature began.</P><P>(10:30 am) One of the gels was remade, as well as another 2% gel ready for the &quot;Gelception&quot; gel, where the team is testing the extraction method.</P><P>(12:10 pm) The PCR products were then loaded onto a gel using as much of the sample as possible (22μl). The gel was run for 2.5 hours at 120 Volts, ensuring the bands are well separated for gel extraction. The Sau3A1 prep was finished and samples placed into the freezer.</P><P>(13:00 pm) Some lab members looked at the primer designs for BioBrick.</P><P>(15:35 pm) The primers were designed, ready for ordering Monday morning. Once the gel finished, it was taken down for transilluminating. Some plates were also taken as some Pseudomonas species' fluoresce under UV light, as can benzene rings. Below is the photo produced from the gel.</P><DIV align="center"><P style="font-size:10px;">Lane organisation is: <B>Chris, fill this in</B></P></DIV><P>(16:00 pm) None of the plates fluoresce under UV which may have been due to the excitation wavelength being different from those attempted. The PCR gel was then wrapped up and stored for gel extraction next week. As the Nanodrop results were low for yesterday's gel extraction from the PCR (at 4.8 for Orange, 5.1 for mixed and 3.2 for yellow when the two extracts were combined), PCR will be conducted using these samples to increase the amount of DNA. Time constraints meant that the &quot;Gelception&quot; gel is to be run on Monday.</P><P>(16:30 pm)The finalised primer sequences were sent to a supervisor to be checked and ordered. The master mix for PCR was set up in the PCR hood.There will be 13 PCR reactions, requiring 270µl of the master mix, enough for aliquots of 18µl in 15 reactions. Reaction mixture list:
171µl PCR H20
60µl HF buffer
6µl dNTPs
15µl Primer A 28f AAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAGA

3µl DNA Polymerase
</P><P>DNApol is stored in glycerol and required mixing and spinning down for a second. The remainder of the dNTPs were disposed of as it cannot be freeze thawed.  In the PCR hood, the master mix was aliquotted into 9 separate PCR eppendorfs with 18μl in each and the negative control prepared using PCR clean H20. The tubes were then taken to the bench where the DNA and the positive P.aeruginosa DNA and negative bench H2O controls. All samples were added at 2µl to make a final volume of 20µl.</P><P>PCR cycle program used was iGEM16S (same as before):</P>
This time instead of loading bacteria from a boilate reaction, a 1/100 dilution was added in of the three different gel extractions at 2µl to each tube to amplify the amount of DNA in these samples. The 1/100 samples were prepared by taking 1µl of the DNA and adding in 99µl of TE buffer. Reaction organisation:
 1 = Positive <I>P. aeruginosa</I> control
 2 = Orange 100x dilution

The adjustments add degeneracy to make them more likely to PCR out the genes that the team want to extract. BLAST searches of the FASTA data, showed that the sequence in P. putida, regardless of strain, is remarkably conserved, with only one or two bases needing any degeneracy at primer binding sites. These modified primers were sent off to a supervisor in advance of the deadline and will hopefully arrive at the end of the week, allowing PCR to begin on the genes that will be made into Biobricks.</P><P>(14:45 pm) Once the Sau3A1 digest gel showed the loading dye was a couple of inches off the end, it was taken to the transilluminator.

Propane is already in the sugar before expansion and requires ventilating it for several days to remove the majority of the propane. However, if the lid is left on for a time, propane will still build up.

The gel was stopped and taken to the transilluminator:</P><DIV align="center"><P style="font-size:10px;">Yet again the bands of the gel extracts are very faint. This time incomparable to the marker DNA.</P></DIV><P>As poor amounts of DNA have been successfully extracted so far, the gel extraction kit is examined and needed testing to see if it worked. This meant we had to gather and PCR more DNA.</P><P>(15:00 pm)The pentane experiment was prepared and ready to be ran. The tubes used have been put on a shaker, and started off at 240rpm. It will be sampled tomorrow morning, and then Friday morning to determine the growth. The 1/100 dilutions of the last gel extraction which we amplified the DNA of were found, and the Boilate was ran to obtain more DNA and run this in the PCR as well. 
</P><P>The triplicate experiment was started.</P><P>(15:30 pm) To test the Gel extraction kit, our supervisor supplied a 1kb DNA ladder of known DNA concentration to pass through the coulomb to see what % recovery there is. This time new reagents from the box were used rather than the ones we have been using to see if this is the problem. 
</P><P>With the minimal media prepared it is set up with 10 ml amounts in 20 corning tubes, and 0.5g of polystyrene &quot;sugar&quot; is set up in the necessary tubes. In preparation for further testing after staying in the shaker for enough time.</P><P>(16:00 pm) One of the members worked on degenerate primers for the rest of the afternoon.</P><P>(16:30 pm) The gel extraction was finished and the tubes put in the fridge ready to run in the morning. The master mix for the PCR was created in the PCR hood. As we are doing 13 PCR reactions, we need to make up 270ul of the master mix which is enough for aliquots of 18µl in 15 reactions. Reaction mixture list:
 171µl PCR H<SUB>2</SUB>0
 60µl HF buffer
 6µl dNTPs
 15µl Primer A 28f AAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAGA
 15µl Primer B 519R GWATTACCGCGGCKGCTG
 2µl Template DNA to be added later to each PCR tube as it is not PCR clean 
 3µl DNA Polymerase
 These reagents were added then as the DNApol was in glycerol the tube was mixed and spun for a second to remove bubbles. dNTPs cannot be freeze thawed so whatever was left was thrown. After this, 18µl aliquots of the master mix were placed into 9 separate PCR eppendorfs and prepared the negative control while in the PCR hood with the PCR clean H<SUB>2</SUB>O. The tubes were then taken to the bench where the DNA was added, and the positive <I>P. aeruginosa</I> DNA and negative bench H<SUB>2</SUB>O controls all samples were added at 2µl to make a final volume of 20µl. 
 PCR cycle program used was iGEM16S which is as follows:
98 degrees C - 5 min
<I>98 degrees C - 30 seconds
50 degrees C - 30 seconds

The test recovered too little DNA which is why we are re ran the experiment with new reagents from a new kit. As the PE was a new set it must be the QG at fault. 1ml aliquots are taken out of the pentane experiment corning tubes that was set up yesterday.

A new way to test if the bacteria are using residual pentane/removing residual pentane from the raw polystyrene sugar to try on Monday was thought up. If this works we can confirm that the bacteria are growing with the polystyrene alone. </DIV><H3 class="calendar">   Monday 17th September 2012</H3><DIV class="day"><P>(08:30 am) The master mix for the PCR was created, and the PCR tubes are put in a PCR machine.</P><P>(09:30 am) Several gel extractions are set up using a new kit with a view to extracting the TodX gene later today. 2 gels are also made. </P><P>(10:00 am) The PCR was started.
</P><P>(10:50 am) An experiment on the aeration of polystyrene was created by putting 20g polystyrene in 500ml duran, putting it in the hybridiser at 60 degrees, to try and vaporise residue pentane in the sugar. Pentane boils at 37<SUP>o</SUP>C so the hybridiser is above the boiling point. The hybridiser has no exposed elements so should be safe for the small amount of pentane left to be vaporised. Two 10g amounts of poly have also been put into tubes and sealed to act as a time zero. These can then be used in a minimal broth poly orange and yellow growth experiment as we can be sure that there is no pentane left over. </P><P>(11:00 am) The pentane experiment was finished and the results analysed. There was a clear increase in absorbance by bacteria as pentane concentration also increases. The presence of polystyrene sugar also appears to increase the bacteria's absorbance, indicating an increase in bacteria concentration.</P><P>(13:00 pm) After nano dropping, and the PCR has finished, the gel extractions were ready to be ran. The PCR program for this run was changed as there was a lot of other interference bands of other amplified areas of DNA. The extension time has been reduced to one minute so only give enough time to amplify the shorter bands.</P><P>PCR cycle program used was iGEMTOL2 which is as follows:
98 degrees C - 5 min
<I>98 degrees C - 30 seconds
65 degrees C - 30 seconds
72 degrees C - 1 minutes</I>72 degrees C - 5 minutes
15 degrees C - Forever (this is for the end of the reaction)</P><P>(12:00 pm) New primers for the genes we've managed to extract are designed, that incorporate the biobrick prefix/suffixes.</P><P>(13:15 pm) Nano drop of the gel extraction was done using a different kit- zymo. </P><P>(14:10 pm) The TobB and the TodF gels were completed and loaded onto gels.  They were then ran at 120V for 2.5 hours, the gel extraction nano drop results had a lot of salt contamination, so we looked into resolving this.</P><P>(16:20 pm) The final gel extraction was complete and the remaining samples from the TodX gel were put through 2x 200μL, 1x600μL, and 1x400μL. Although the protocol said 200μL twice, the bottle of the wash buffer said between 200μL and 600μL.</P><P>(17:30 pm) The gel extractions didn't work again:
</P><DIV align="center"><P style="font-size:10px;"> Apart from the DNA markers, there are no obvious bands in our samples. </P></DIV></DIV><H3 class="calendar">   Tuesday 18th September 2012</H3><DIV class="day"><P>(09:00 am) Set up the PCR.</P><P>(11:00 am) Prepared and loaded the PCR gel of the 16S samples from last night, running at 120V on a 2% gel for 2.5 hours.</P><P>The lane organisation is as follows:

For the sequencing only the reverse primer was to be used. The primer was diluted three fold from the 10μM concentration, and 2μL of each of the 5A and 5B were sequenced as these were the best extracts. </P><P>(14:30 pm) After analysis of the 16S PCR from last night, it shows contamination in the negative controls, both bench and hood. Tis was done using new polymerase, DNTP's and buffers so the contamination was either in the primers or PCR water. As we ran out of PCR water this was going to be fresh for the next set of reactions, however the TodC1 used the same water so we can compare when this is run on the gel.</P><P>(15:00 pm) After preparing the TodX PCR samples from this morning with the old polymerase (had a slight problem so the TodC1 and TodG PCR reactions used fresh polymerase). We used this to test the polymerase for contamination from the 16s experiment. Next 5μL of loading dye was placed into each sample and two new gels are made ready for these to be run, with the 3rd gel in the gel tank.</P><P>(16:20 pm) The TodX PCR gel from this morning was loaded and ran at 120V.</P><P> The lane organisation is:

</P><P>(17:00 pm) The reamplification on the TodX Gel extraction was set up, and as there were only 5 samples the PCR was only set up for 10 to save on reagents, only doing each one once and the controls. The master mix for the PCR was made in the PCR hood. For the 9 PCR reactions, we needed to make up 180ul of the master mix which is enough for aliquots of 18ul in 10 reactions.</P><P>The reaction mixture list:

After transilluminating, it was realised that the power pack was set too high (120v instead of 20v), so all of the DNA had run off the end of the gel:</P><P>This meant that once the PCR has been stopped we needed to re-run these primers to re extract the DNA from yesterday. As all of the DNA had run off the gel, it is remelted so we can reuse it. The gel is remade to run some of the TodX Gel extraction PCR amplification from last night's PCR. This time only single bands should have been amplified, so we did a PCR purification rather than run it all and gel extract due to the low yields.</P><P>(10:15 am) The first gel was made after a few problems with the melting and the PCR for the TodC1 and TodG samples was set up. When these were done we can ran 2µl of last nights PCR to see what bands are present. </P><P>(10:30 am) Next the master mix for the PCR of the TodG and TodC1 was set up in the PCR hood.

More gel had to be remade to replace the spilt stuff.</P><P>(12:00 pm) The TodX gel extraction re amplification gel samples were set up. As the team decided to do PCR purification rather than gel extraction, only 2μL of the 5 reactions were loaded so we needed 18 uL of DNA to purify. Samples were made by adding 4μL of loading dye to 14μL of TE buffer and 2μL of each of the sample. The <I>P. aeruginosa</I> and negative controls had 5μL of loading dye added and were loaded completly as they were more to test the PCR rather than for extraction of the DNA.</P><P>(12:40 pm) The gel was loaded and ran at 120V.</P><P>The lane organisation was:

After this the 18ul aliquots of the master mix were seperated into 9 PCR eppendorfs. The negative control was prepared in the PCR hood with the PCR clean H<SUB>2</SUB>O. The tubes were then taken to the bench where the DNA was added, and the positive <I>P. aeruginosa</I> DNA and negative bench H2O controls all samples were added at 2µl to make a final volume of 20µl.</P><P> PCR cycle program used was iGEM16S which is as follows:

 The different amounts of DNA ladder were to see if the concentrations from the Nano Drop were correct.</P><P>(11:40 am) The 16s gel was stopped and transilluminated after being ran for a hour. Surprisingly there were bands for all of the reactions, however there were also bands in the negative bench and a lighter band in the negative hood controls. Because we used fresh primers, DNTp's, and there was no contamination last time we used the pol and reaction buffer the only logical explanation is the PCR H<SUB>2</SUB>O or technique. This meant we needed to obtain a fresh stock of PCR H<SUB>2</SUB>O for the next set of reactions. This sets the team back again. </P><DIV align="center"><P style="font-size:10px;"> The problematic 16S gel where the negatives are contaminated and appear on the gel </P></DIV><P>(13:30 pm) The gel purification gel was stopped which was transilluminated. There is DNA in the purification and it is high ng/ul. We have just got the sequence data back from the DNA and it looks like we haven't extracted the TodX gene itself. The sequence was from the reverse primer, we re did this with the forward primer to get the full set of data.</P><P>(14:30 pm) PCR was prepared for the 16s, TodX and TodF genes. At the same time the original PCR of the TodF gel was running at 150V, and stopped and transilluminated every 15 min. </P><P>(15:00 pm) A new master mix for the PCR 16S orange and yellow bacteria is created. This was done in the PCR hood. This time 9 PCR reactions are done, so we needed to make up 180µl of the master mix which is enough for aliquots of 18ul in 10 reactions. Reaction mixture list:

</P><P>(10:00 am) The 16S PCR had finished so the samples were prepared to run on a gel. As there was 20μL of sample 2μL was loaded to make calculations easier, the remaining 18μL was to be put through the QIAquick QIAGEN PCR Purification (Cat. No. 28104). Protocol for the PCR purification can be found on the QIAGEN website, the only alterations to the protocol were step 4 and 7 leaving them for 5 minutes each time before the centrifugation step. </P><P>(12:00 pm) The gel was poured then loaded with the PCR products.</P><P>The lane organisation is as follows:

</P><P>(12:40 pm) A nano drop was performed on the PCR purification products to work out rough ng/μL for each of the samples. The 260/280 ratios were all around the 1.4 mark with concentrations being between 36 and 46ng/μL for the seven samples. Then the samples were prepared ready to be run on a gel. To work out the concentrations more accurately using 3μL ( 10%) of the 30μL total elution volume making each up to 20μL to be run on the gel. A new 2% gel was made ready for this to be run after lunch. </P><P>(13:00 pm) 3.3nM aliquots of the 16S primers were prepared for the sequencing reaction in the PCR hood. This was done by diluting 10nM primers 1:2 with PCR H2O. Once this had been done the samples were given to a supervisor ready to be run with forward and reverse primers.
</P><P>(14:00 pm) We stopped and transilluminated the gel, the bands were in the correct place for the 16S sequences however there was contamination again in the negative controls. The gel was loaded with the PCR purification products.
