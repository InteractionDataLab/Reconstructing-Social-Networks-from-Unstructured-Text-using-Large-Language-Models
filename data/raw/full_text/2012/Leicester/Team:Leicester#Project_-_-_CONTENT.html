Some bacteria form biofilms on polystyrene, indicating that polystyrene may be being degraded. We have several different parts to our project, including a citizen science experiment (CSE)where members of the public are helping us.</P><P>It is not clear how the bacteria actually degrade the polystyrene, as no biochemical pathway for polystyrene degradation has been found, so far. It is possible that the reason why degradation appears to be so slow is because no existing degradation pathway has evolved specifically to tackle polystyrene. Enzymes in other pathways may be involved in degradation but as they are not adapted for polystyrene, the rate will be very slow. There are a couple of pathways we have been looking into that could be involved: the styrene degradation pathway (as styrene is the monomer of polystyrene), and the toluene degradation pathway (this could be involved in breaking open the bulky, unreactive phenyl side chain, making it easier for aliphatic degrading enzymes to degrade the main chain). We've done some modeling of the first enzyme in the toluene degrading pathway, and future Leicester iGEM teams may be able to artificially mutate the first enzyme to see whether our potential modification could work (see the modeling page). </P><P>We intend to extract the genes involved in pathways degrading Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), and / or develop a new pathway involving modified enzymes able to degrade aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons that can fit polystyrene and its derivatives into their active sites. The bacteria that we insert these new genes into should then be able to degrade polystyrene at a higher rate than natural bacteria. Future iGEM teams at the University of Leicester could harness this bacterial strain to produce useful products.</P><P>Since starting the project, as well as this wiki, we've created a blogspot blog<A href="http://uoleicesterigem2012.blogspot.co.uk" target="_blank"> uoleicesterigem2012</A>, a Twitter account<A href="https://twitter.com/iGEMLeicester" target="_blank"> @iGEM Leicester</A> and a facebook page<A href="http://www.facebook.com/uoleicesterigem" target="_blank"> uoleicesterigem</A> to increase our audience.

</P><H1>Project Details</H1><H2>Making Polystyrene selection media </H2><P>The first stage involved making a selection media to isolate bacterial colonies that could survive with polystyrene as effectively the only carbon source available, making it difficult for bacteria unable to degrade polystyrene to survive. However, salts containing the other minerals needed for survival must be present. We found a minimal salts media recipe (Atiq <I>et al.</I>,2010) that avoided other carbon sources while still making other essential elements available. We spent several weeks attempting to dissolve polystyrene into the agar, using various solvents such as acetone (which just took the air out of expanded polystyrene, rather than dissolving the polymer, and dissolved petri dishes), toluene (which dissolved polystyrene 'sugar' (pre-expanded polystyrene beads donated to us by Styropack ltd.)but also dissolved the plates) and various alcohols (which didn't dissolve polystyrene). In the end, we decided not to use a solvent, and instead sprinkled the polystyrene 'sugar' on top of the minimal media once poured, so that the 'sugar' was available to bacteria spread on the surface.</P><H5>The Protocol</H5><P> Polystyrene selection media (or polystyrene minimal media) is made first by making up a minimal broth using the recipe from (Atiq <I>et al.</I>,2010) by dissolving 1g K<SUB>2</SUB>HPO<SUB>4</SUB>, 0.2g KH<SUB>2</SUB>PO<SUB>4</SUB>, 1g NaCl, 0.002g CaCl<SUB>2</SUB>.2H<SUB>2</SUB>O, 0.005g Boric Acid, 1g (NH<SUB>4</SUB>)2SO<SUB>4</SUB>, 0.5g MgSO<SUB>4</SUB>.7H<SUB>2</SUB>O, 0.001g CuSO<SUB>4</SUB>.5H<SUB>2</SUB>O, 0.001g ZnSO<SUB>4</SUB>.7H<SUB>2</SUB>O, 0.001 g MnSO<SUB>4</SUB>.H<SUB>2</SUB>O and 0.01g FeSO<SUB>4</SUB>.7H<SUB>2</SUB>O, per litre H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Melt 2% electrophoresis grade agarose to the broth to solidify it after cooling using a microwave, and heat until the agarose is completely melted/dissolved. Allow media to cool by keeping it at 60 degrees C until needed. To make a selection plate, use 95% media and 5% polystyrene 'sugar' (polystyrene beads before they've been expanded in the manufacturing process). We determined that 10 grams as a total mass of minimal media and solution per plate was optimal. We poured out the media, and before it solidified, sprinkled the polystyrene on top, to prevent the 'sugar' from sinking to the bottom so allowing bacteria colonies to access the polystyrene as a carbon source. The agarose is the only other carbon source in the plate (except obviously the plate itself), so any colonies that grow should be utilising polystyrene as a carbon source, or at least have evolved pathways to deal with the toxic effects that a long chain hydrocarbon could cause bacteria (such as interfering with the cell membrane, due to the hydrophobic nature of parts of both).</P><H2>The Citizen Science Experiment</H2><P>The CSE was used to get the public involved in trying to find bacteria that could live on, and degrade expanded polystyrene (EPS). We asked them to bury a strip of EPS in the ground and leave it for a length of time (around 2 months), to find out whether bacteria might establish colonies, thus indicating that a colony could at the very least bind to, and possibly degrade EPS. The kits were Risk Assessed, and a copy of the assessment was included in the kit, along with instructions, a strip of EPS, and a self seal bag to put the EPS into. This was all contained in a stamped, addressed envelope at a cost to the public of £2 (+50p postage if bought online via our blog to cover the cost of sending the kit to the person). We recently had our first batch of kits back, ready to analyse.</P><P> we made a YouTube video explaining what the public had to do with the polystyrene strip:</P><P> Since this experiment was launched, around 40 CSE kits have been returned, allowing us to plate them out and find bacteria able to degrade polystyrene. The best kit that has been returned so far has been kit 01#502, which has yielded 2 different types of bacteria (we're not sure whether they are the same species, but instead just different strains). Both types of bacteria were growing together on a polystyrene-minimal media plate, which could indicate a mutual relationship in polystyrene degradation. Later experiments (see polystyrene growth experiment) were conducted to confirm they were using polystyrene.</P><H5>The Protocol</H5><P> The first part involves halving the returned expanded polystyrene (EPS) lengthways with sterilized scissors in our returned citizen science experiment (CSE) kits so that we'll still have some of each sample left should we need it. First we need to do a practice with unused EPS strips (control and test). Pour/pipette 20ml LB agar into a petri dish and allow to set. Put line down middle in permanent marker USING A RULER! Then label one side swab (for the swabbing/scraping material) and the other side strip for the EPS strip (can use other names if you prefer). Add 50 micro litres of PBS (phosphate buffered saline) to each side of the half strip of EPS and scrape with spreader, before spreading onto the left half of the agar (or side labeled as 'swab'). Try to swab any mud off the strip if possible. Then place the half strip in the centre of the other half labeled 'strip'. Leave for a week at room temperature on the lab bench and examine agar for colonies. The other half of the strip should be put back into cold storage for future use.</P><P> After letting the organisms grow for a few weeks, select some vigourously growing colonies and spread them out onto a polystyrene minimal media plate divided into 6 sections, where each selected colony is allocated its own segment. Leave at room temperature or at 37<SUP>o</SUP>C, checking each day. The bacteria that grow are likely to only grow very slowly, so it could be a month or more until you see a visible colony, due to the low polystyrene degrading rates of bacterial enzymes. If a colony grows, extract some, add the sample to luria broth, and grow overnight on a shaker at room temperature or 37 <SUP>o</SUP>C. Boilate the colony by boiling the bacteria in distilled water for 10 minutes, before centrifuging at 13,000 RPM for 5 minutes to remove cell debris- the supernatent should contain DNA, which you can then add to a PCR mix and amplify overnight </P><H2>Gram Stain</H2></TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top"><P> Prepare a light suspension of cells from very young cultures grown on appropriate agar medium.

However, we ran out of time, and ended up attempting to PCR out Tod operon genes that we thought could be partially responsible for polystyrene degradation. We set up DNA digestion assays to find out the time taken to get fragments of a particular length (from 1Kbp to 10 Kbp). We started doing the digests at 37<SUP>o</SUP>C, but we realised that this caused Sau3A1 to digest DNA too quickly, even at very low concentrations.</P><H5> The protocol</H5><P>First off, a reaction mixture was prepared using: 4µg of DNA (in our case, we needed 53.7µl of DNA in buffer), 7.5µl 10x NE buffer 1, 0.75µl 100x BSA, 0.5µl Sau3A1 (to be added last), and topped up to a final total of 75µl with distilled H<SUB>2</SUB>O. 1µl Sau3A1 is 4 units of enzyme (1 unit can digest 1µg λ DNA in 1 hour @ 37<SUP>o</SUP>C in 50µl total reaction volume). The reaction we found, was easier to control and get better gel photos at room temperature. We made 8 stopping aliquots to stop samples of the reaction at time=0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and one taken before enzyme was added. Each stopping aliquot was made up of 4µl Loading dye, 2µl 0.5M EDTA and 6 µl H<SUB>2</SUB>O put in iced water. At each time, 8µl of reaction mixture was removed from the reaction mixture and added to a stop aliquot (EDTA binds to and removes Mg<SUP>2+</SUP> ions from Sau3A1, inhibiting the enzyme, and the iced water stops the enzyme from working). These were then run on a 0.7% agarose gel and transilluminated to reveal a clear curve in DNA fragment length as time increased:</P></TD><TD><DIV align="centre"><P style="font-size:10px"> Although there are a few imperfections in the gel, making the DNA in each lane not run completely straight, a decrease in average sizes of DNA fragments is visible.

This indicates a possible need for a mixed, yellow and orange colonies to have access to polystyrene for theur growth using it as a sole carbon source. As in its absence it may indicate possible bacterial colony death, this assumption is based on the reduction in spectrophotometry readings between the two days. The spectrophotometer readings for each colony have at least two readings that are similar so this data can be classified as significant. However these results from the spectrophotometer lead to differing conclusions from what we can obtained on the 11/09/2012, so these results are still not conclusive.</P><H5>Re-inoculated to test whether pentane is the energy source for growing bacteria.</H5><P>The aerated treatment [DETAIL TREATMENT HERE!] is to hopefully eliminate pentane contamination by its removal to see that hopefully polystyrene is whats being used not pentane.</P><TABLE width="100%" border="1" style="background-color:white"><TBODY><TR><TD> </TD><TH>Friday 21st September (abs)</TH><TH>Average Readings (abs)</TH><TH>Monday 24th September (abs)</TH><TH>Average Readings (abs)</TH><TH>Average Growth Over Days (abs)</TH></TR><TR><TD>M.M (no bacteria)</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (aerated polystyrene no bacteria)</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (non-aerated polystyrene no   bacteria)</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (non-aerated,yellow) X1</TD><TD>0.012</TD><TD>0.013333333</TD><TD>-0.043</TD><TD>-0.033666667</TD><TD>-0.047</TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (non-aerated,yellow) X2</TD><TD>0.013</TD><TD> </TD><TD>-0.031</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (non-aerated,yellow) X3</TD><TD>0.015</TD><TD> </TD><TD>-0.027</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (non aerated,orange)X1</TD><TD>0.01</TD><TD>0.015</TD><TD>-0.043</TD><TD>-0.033666667</TD><TD>-0.047</TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (non aerated,orange)X2</TD><TD>0.009</TD><TD> </TD><TD>-0.014</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (non aerated,orange)X3</TD><TD>0.026</TD><TD> </TD><TD>-0.035</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (non aerated,mix) X1</TD><TD>0.002</TD><TD>0.014</TD><TD>-0.035</TD><TD>-0.016333333</TD><TD>-0.045666667</TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (non aerated,mix) X2</TD><TD>0.038</TD><TD> </TD><TD>0.003</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (non aerated,mix) X3</TD><TD>0.002</TD><TD> </TD><TD>-0.017</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (aerated,mix) X1</TD><TD>0.005</TD><TD>0.013666667</TD><TD>-0.02</TD><TD>-0.015333333</TD><TD>-0.029</TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (aerated,mix) X2</TD><TD>0.026</TD><TD> </TD><TD>-0.012</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (aerated,mix) X3</TD><TD>0.01</TD><TD> </TD><TD>-0.014</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (aerated,orange) X1</TD><TD>0.01</TD><TD>0.009333333</TD><TD>-0.027</TD><TD>-0.025666667</TD><TD>-0.035</TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (aerated,orange) X2</TD><TD>0.009</TD><TD> </TD><TD>-0.034</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (aerated,orange) X3</TD><TD>0.009</TD><TD> </TD><TD>-0.016</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (aerated,yellow) X1</TD><TD>0.004</TD><TD>0.012333333</TD><TD>-0.008</TD><TD>-0.008333333</TD><TD>-0.020666667</TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (aerated,yellow) X2</TD><TD>0.026</TD><TD> </TD><TD>-0.005</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M.P (aerated,yellow) X3</TD><TD>0.007</TD><TD> </TD><TD>-0.012</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M (yellow) X1</TD><TD>0.029</TD><TD>0.026</TD><TD>0.028</TD><TD>0.029666667</TD><TD>0.003666667</TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M (yellow) X2</TD><TD>0.025</TD><TD> </TD><TD>0.027</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M (yellow) X3</TD><TD>0.024</TD><TD> </TD><TD>0.034</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M (orange) X1</TD><TD>0.039</TD><TD>0.045</TD><TD>0.056</TD><TD>0.057</TD><TD>0.012</TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M (orange) X2</TD><TD>0.044</TD><TD> </TD><TD>0.052</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M (orange) X3</TD><TD>0.052</TD><TD> </TD><TD>0.063</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M (mix) X1</TD><TD>0.026</TD><TD>0.034</TD><TD>0.031</TD><TD>0.014666667</TD><TD>-0.019333333</TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M (mix) X2</TD><TD>0.056</TD><TD> </TD><TD>0.006</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR><TR><TD>M.M (mix) X3</TD><TD>0.02</TD><TD> </TD><TD>0.007</TD><TD> </TD><TD> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>These results are inconclusive so no firm conclusions can be drawn from this data.

Another approachis to concentrate on improving the enzymes within the pathway to accept polystyrene more readily via mutagenesis. Although we were unfortunately unable to amplify any genes present in the Tod operon from the isolated microbes, a future team, with the correct strain of <I>P. putida</I>, should be able to create a biobrick from genes of the Tod operon relatively easily. This that could potentially be partially responsible for polystyrene degradation. If future teams can find the elusive pathway(s) responsible, they may be able to couple this degradation (and the energy released) to synthesis of useful products (such as lactic acid for the synthesis of biofoam (a new product, very similar to polystyrene, but biodegradable in the right circumstances).</P><H1> References </H1><P>Atiq, N., Ahmed, S., Ali, M., Andleeb, S., Ahmad, B., Robson, G., 2010.
