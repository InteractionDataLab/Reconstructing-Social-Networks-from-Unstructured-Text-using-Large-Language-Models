We work together with KAIT_Japan on issues of safety.
Cooperatively with KAIT_Japan, We iGEM Kyoto placed icons on our Wiki, which immediately enable you to see a risk of parts. The icons are as follows:
Bio safety level 1
Bio safety level 2
Bio safety level 3
cases which affect biological community
cases which affect the environment
cases which affect human bodies
cases which includes a certain risk because of mutations
safe
