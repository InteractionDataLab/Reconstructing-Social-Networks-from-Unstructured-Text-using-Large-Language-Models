Spin down 100µL culture and suspend into sample buffer.
Boil at 95°C for 10 min.
Apply 10µL to polyacrylamide gel.
Electrophorese at 500V, 30mA for 50 min.
Transfer at 50V, 100mA for 30 min.
Add blocking buffer to the membrane and incubate with shaking for 30 min. at room temperature.
Add appropriate primary antibody diluted in TBST and incubate with shaking for 30 min. at RT.
Wash with TBST and incubate with shaking for 10 min, two times.
Add secondary antibody conjugated with AP and incubate with shaking for 30 min. at RT.
Wash with TBST and incubate with shaking for 10 min, three times.
Add 66µL NBT and 33µLof BCIP into color development buffer., and add the mixture to the membrane.
After the coloring, wash with DW.

Method:
1. Peel cuticles on parafilm by using the head of pencil.(Menasha,wI,54952)
2. Put plant cells into GFP&R9 or GFP for 5~30min.
3. Put plant cells into PBS.
4. Hoechst dyeing.
