Safety
Q1:Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:  researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
      No, just like other office software, it  doesn't involve harmful materials or attack. It concentrates on  viewing and analyzing biological data and designing  regulatory elements of  metabolic networks, which will be no possible to cause any public or  environmental problem.
 
Q2:Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this  year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the  Registry? how did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams  learn from your experience?
      As a software team, we are not intended to  make new biobricks and no safety issues could come out from it. For a software, the most  important safety concern is network safety. Our software can be used offline, so  it's safer to a large extent. Other software teams should also pay attention  to the network  safety of their software.
Q3:Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?  If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?  If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
      Yes, there is a biosafety committee in our  school,  and Center for Disease Control and Prevention in our city. We  consulted to them, and they thought our project is safe for the reasons blow:
      There are four pars in the software. Among them,  GenomeBrowser, MetaNetwork and Simulator are all tools assisting  scientists to view or analyze biological data, which will not generate  harmful outcomes. Riboswitch and SiRNA focus on the  design of regulatory elements of metabolic networks, thus it's also away  from harms.
Q4:Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that  could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and  systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
      We advise that it can establish a risk evaluating system, giving each BioBrick a safety  index, to assess the quality and reliability of them.

Poster
      To propagate Synthetic Biology and iGEM  among students in SYSU, we displayed relevant posters outside the Museum of  Biology, which is located in the center of campus.
Lecture
      Cooperating with TED x Guangzhou, we  invited some professors and previous iGEM team of SYSU to delivery a series of  speeches to the public.
Course
      As a team in Software Division, we  design a special activity to accomodate our theme of " Processing Biology in  Silico". Our major investigator estabished a course,named Applying Biology  Database and Software to the research, to the students in SYSU.
