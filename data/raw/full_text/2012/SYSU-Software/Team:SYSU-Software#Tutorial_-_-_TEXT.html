Home
On the left is the logo of BiArkit which is created by 2012  SYSU-software igem team.
In the main display window, there are  six buttons, G-Circle, Network Illustrator, RiboSwitch, Genome Browser, SiRNA,  Biobrick, and Simulator, which will take you to corresponding parts once  clicking.
Genome Browser
Procedure:
In the main display window, the first  ribbon is the sequence that the user has inputted, and the third ribbon shows  the corresponding gene annotation. You can click any annotation that you want,  and then the sequence site will automatically jump to the fragment related to  it. Between those ribbons is an adjustable slider, which can adjust your view  location by sliding to the left or to the right. Above the sequence are the head  and tail of the location that you are viewing while the head and tail of the  whole sequence are displayed in the bottom textbox. What’s more, the textbox  contains the length, product, tag of the sequence, and links of related papers  are also included sometimes.
On the left, there are two useful tools:  you can search the fragment that you want by position, product or name (Position  represents the position of its head, Product and Name stand for products and  names of related genes, both of them support fuzzy search), besides, whether you  choose product or name, a dialog box that contains names of related genes will  appear; the slider of Zoom is designed for regulating the display frame rate of  the sequence.
Biobrick
 
Procedure:
Notice that there is a finder on the  left; you can search biobricks by key words and then a window showing the search  result will pop up. Bellow it is a list of biobrick. Turning to the right, a  schematic diagram that shows components of the biobrick is on the top. And  related information about the biobrick is below it.
 
RiboSwitch
Procedure:
On the right is the main operating area  and you can choose your target type (your experimental object) and corresponding  target name, aptamer and regulation direction. Attention should be paid to the  input box named Input your Target. You can search your target name by key words  or even several letters of it. It should be useful to you. Click GO and you will see a picture. The  designed riboswitch is in the dotted box on the top left corner. Below it is a  diagram to show how the riboswitch works. Besides, there is a list on the left  box. It records your choices that you have made in created riboswich project,  and you need only click GO next time.
 
SiRNA
Procedure:
 
Network Illustrator
Procedure:
In the main display window, you will see  a network from KEGG website. On the left, there is a finder; you can search  elements in the network and a window that shows the search result will pop up.  Bellow it is a box containing a list of files that you have opened. Pay  attention that you can right click the main display window to open another KEGG  xml file or to search any element in the network (choose find element).
 
Simulator
Procedure:
 
 
There are 5 options for you to select: exhaustive single  deletion, reaction deletion, Fva analysis, Perturbation analysis and PhPP analysis.  They with FBA solve will be introduced in detail. You can select all of them or  part of them, or even nothing, then click Go. If you select none of them, you will see a table showed basic  information of each reaction. If you select several of them, the corresponding  windows will tiled in the resulting window. If you select reaction deletion  option, a selection of the reaction you want to wipe off is required, and if  there is any change, it will be highlighted in red font.
1.      FBA_solve
Above column displays names of the  reactions while the right one displays the flux amount of each reaction
 
2. exanstive single deletion
Calculate the flux amount of the  objective reaction when each other reaction is deleted one by one.
Left column display names of the  reactions
The right one displays the flux amount  of objective reaction the user has chosen, when each other reaction is deleted  one by one.
 
when rolling down the screen, you can  see the reaction-names related to lethal deletions, sub optimal deletions and  super optimaldeletions.
This graph shows how many lethal  knockouts in each reaction subsystem. The information of the reaction subsystem  can be attained in SBML
This hist graph shows the frequency of  reaction which has different quantified effect showed in the X-axis opon  objective reaction.
 
3. reaction deletion
Middle column displays the flux amount  of the wild type while the right column displays the mutant type, which is  calculated based on the deletion of one chosen reaction.
 
4. FVA analysis
 
5.Perturbation  analysis:
 
X-axis refers  to the continuously increasing flux value of the chosen reaction.
Y-axis refers  to the flux value of the objective reaction according to the variation of the  flux value of chosen reaction in the X-axis
 
 
6.PhPP analysis
 
The value  marked on the contour represents the flux value of the objective reaction based  on the variation of two chosen reactions The color of the graph changes  according to the altitude, namely, the objective flux value.
 
G-Circle
 
Procedure:
 
 
 
 
You can open several file so that you can  compare the difference of these genomes. Each genome have 2 circles in the  picture: the outer one is the genes of the genome, the inner is the expression  level of corresponding genes. By the way, right click different sites in the  small panoramic window or left click and drag the picture in the zoom window,  you can move to anywhere you want to enlarge and see more details in the  amplifier window.
 
Clotho
All above seven parts have been  developed into Clotho apps and have been updated  into Clotho, which has met the  requirements for gold medal of IGEM.
