Overall
The first version of BiArkit is now completed and released. The second version, BiArkit 2.0, has been proposed and designed to be more competent to  fulfill the needs of synthetic biology researchers. BiArkit 2.0 will still concentrate on how to deeply exploit  bio-information for researchers to design and execute their further experiments.  First, every kit will be optimized functionally and ameliorated to be more  user-friendly. Second, the explosion of second generation sequencing motivates  us to involve the next generation sequencing data to BiArkit 2.0.  Third, for more information coming from biological systems, including  reconstruction networks, molecular interactions, and artificial networks, we  will make standards and integrate them into one section to provide the  comprehensive prospects for researchers to employ. Fourth, as BiArkit was coden by JAVA, we plan to make this  software run not only on Win but also on the platform of Mac and Linux.
GenomeBrowser
The updated GenoneBrowser will incorporate bio-information out of RNA-Seq,  ChIP-Seq and tiling-array to illustrate the genome expression level under given  conditions and locate molecular that interact with the genomes. With the known  annotation, the genomes can be divided according to the products they  transcribed. Besides, for make this kit more user friendly, we are going to  refine it and allow researchers to screen their interested genomes graphically  only by pasting the relevant web links to the interface. After pasting the  links, this kit will download the xml or fasta from the original web  automatically.
Biobrick
The updated Biobrick section will focus on three parts to be optimized. First,  we will specifically classify the known biobricks. As lots of accomplishments by  using biobricks have come out, some bricks have been tested to be adjustable to  the specific kinds of researches. For example, a kind of biobricks are always  used to implement the cell signals transportation and another kind are always  applied to the cell colony communication etc. This research-oriented classification facilitate researchers get the useful information they need  conveniently and efficiently. Second, we will refine the codes to make this kit  updated immediately according to the official website. Third, we will try to  improve the ways of restoring the data by documenting more graph and credit  identification information for each biobricks.
 
Regulator Designer
Apart from Riboswitch and SiRNA, some other kinds of  regulator will also be considered in the next version of the kit. One of the  most common used in synthetic biology is transcriptional factors (TFs). We will  develop a TFs matcher for researchers to find their desired TFs according to the  experimental requirements. The selection process is executed based on the  existent TFs database and previous common used TFs in synthetic biology. And our  ultimate goal is to add the regulator designer, including riboswitch, siRNA, TFs  and others to the Clotho frame for sharing among all the researchers.
Simulator
The advanced version of Simulator will be improved  from three prospects.
(1) One focuses on ameliorating the Algorithms of the original one. The next version of Simulator, other methods  for simulating will combined into this part according to the completeness of the  information necessary for certain kind of analysis provided by the SBML files.  In the first version, we use the constraint-based FBA  but in the next version algorithm with both constraint and kinetic approaches will be applied to enhance the reliability and  sensitivity of simulation. For program code To realize FBA analysis, the original version is realized based  on Package ‘abcdeFBA’ of R. While in the second version of this part,  programming will be supported directly by JAVA or C++, which will not only  reduce the size of the software but also accelerate computation.
(2) One focuses on improving the user experiencing.  Firstly, for model used in simulation, users will not only use SBML files  documented in released database like Biomodels but also can edit and save the  SBML in a user-friendly way. Information necessary for FBA including reactions  and metabolites will be showed clearly and in the interface where user can  revise model . The new model can be saved in a revised SBML file. Secondly, the  metabolic network can be visualized in the interface. Users can drag the  pathways joint to a right place in the screen like playing the building block  game, which can add to the fun of this simulation.
(3) Inspired by the recent whole-cell model in  predicting phenotype and giving insights in some undiscovered cellular  behaviors, we plan to expand our models and simulation not only concentrating on  metabolome information but also should involve genome annotation, transcriptome  , proteome and molecular interaction into consideration. As cell processes have  been divided into 28 submodels and synthetic biology have developed many typical  artificial systems recent years, we hope to give out a new standard for  documenting these cellular process and relevant bioinformation mentioned above  in one file. Thus, researchers just need to edit such kinds of files, such as  adding metabolites or deleting one interaction between two molecular, to  simulate their designed systems before experiments. And the mentioned  comprehensive bio-information can be applied to offset the difference between  prediction and experiments, which often motivate the discovery of unobserved  cellular process.
Trans-platform Realization
As the first version of BiArkit is written by JAVA  completely, it facilitate us to make the whole software transferable. BiArkit  2.0 will be available on both of Mac and Linux and researchers can use it  conveniently in terms of their own equipments.
