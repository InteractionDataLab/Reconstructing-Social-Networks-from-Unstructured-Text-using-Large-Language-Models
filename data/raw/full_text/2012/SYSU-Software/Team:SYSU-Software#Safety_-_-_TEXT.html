Question IV
Q1:Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:  researcher safety, public safety, or environmental safety?
      No, just like other office software, it isn't  involved with harmful material or attack. It only can be used to assisting  viewing and analyzing biological data and designing  regulatory elements of  metabolic networks, which will scarcely cause any public or environmental  problem. The software itself will not do harm to researcher either.
 
Q2:Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this  year raise any safety issues? If yes, did you document these issues in the  Registry? how did you manage to handle the safety issue? How could other teams  learn from your experience?
      As a software team, we didn't make any  BioBrick. and no safety issues happened from this. For a software, the most  important safety concern is network safety. Our software can be used offline, so  it's safer in some way. Other software team should pay attention on the network  safety of their software.
Q3:Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?  If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about your project?  If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
      Yes, there are biosafety committee in our  school,  and Center for Disease Control and Prevention in our city. We  consulted them, and they think our project is safety, the reasons are as  follows:
      There four part in the software. Among them,  Genome Browser,Network Illustrator and Simulator are all tools assisting  scientists to view or analyze biological data, which will not produce and  harmful substance or destroy anything. The Regulator Designer focus on the  design of regulatory elements of metabolic networks, It's also safety.
Q4:Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that  could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and  systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
      Set a risk evaluating system, give each BioBrick a safety mark, not by  estimating by man, but by a calculating equation.
