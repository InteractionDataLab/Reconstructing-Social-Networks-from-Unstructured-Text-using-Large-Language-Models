Poster
      To propagate Synthetic Biology and iGEM  among students in SYSU, we displayed relevant posters outside the Museum of  Biology, which is located in the center of campus.
Lecture
      Cooperating with TED x Guangzhou, we  invited some professors and previous iGEM team of SYSU to delivery a series of  speeches to the public.
Course
      As a team in Software Division, we  design a special activity to accomodate our theme of " Processing Biology in  Silico". Our major investigator estabished a course,named Applying Biology  Database and Software to the research, to the students in SYSU.
