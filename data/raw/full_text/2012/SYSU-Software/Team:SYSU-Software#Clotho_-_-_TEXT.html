Clotho App
Introduction
Clotho assists researchers to engineer synthetic  biological systems and manage the data which is used to create them. It has been  developed as the App environment that anyone can create and share new tools in  it. These tools facilitate synthetic biologists to arrange their researches  under the computer-based and automated- designed environment.
Thus, to advanced develop the Clotho  frame, we have successfully transfer the seven parts of our software, BiArkit,  into Apps. Users can choose to employ our software through the Clotho media. The  specific information is shown below:
