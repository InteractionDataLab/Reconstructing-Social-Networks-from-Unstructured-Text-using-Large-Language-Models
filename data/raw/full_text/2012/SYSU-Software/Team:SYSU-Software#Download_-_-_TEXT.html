Introduction
      BiArkit contains 7 softwares.
      For visualization of genomic data and expression level of functional genes, we develop  1. GenomeBrowser and       2. G-Circle which has been added to the Clotho frame for researchers. Besides,  3. Biobrick is localized and transformed into searching kit for users to get comprehensive information conveniently. Further,       4. Riboswitch and       5. SiRNA are designed to compute out potential regulatory parts for engineering systems. For processing data from system level,      6. MetaNetwork can illustrate information of various biological pathways on the graphical and user-friendly interface. And       7. Simulator is intended for modificating and simulating genome-scale metabolic models, which involves many kinds of analysis to predict possible results of conditional changes in experiments.
