Congratulations Karen Elias
Karen Elias - Alimentos Transgenicos
Karen Elias - Human Tree
Karen Elias - Instrumento Humano
“Alimentos Transgenicos” by Karen Elias, 2012.
Perhaps one area that has experienced more synthetic biology is food, hence now we have had a boom in so-called transgenic or modified foods. This picture suggests the same line of improving the edible, but this time with the merger of two fruits, obtaining new fruit flavors.
“Human Tree” by Karen Elias, 2012.
It is said that humans and plants are synonymous with life. Hence it raises the proposal of using synthetic biology as a way to achieve the union of these two beings to create manlike trees. Not with the same skills, but similar, maybe that way they have more compassion and cut them less.
“Instrumento Humano” by Karen Elias, 2012.
The motivation for this work stems from thinking that someday musical instruments can be incorporated into the human body. If we already have a complex sound system in our mouth why not have a violin or a flute on the back on the finger?, And synthetic biology is the way to incorporate or create these new membranes in humans who would work as musical beings. It could never been known what kind of new tunes the man could give us with his instrument and the instrument as a man.
