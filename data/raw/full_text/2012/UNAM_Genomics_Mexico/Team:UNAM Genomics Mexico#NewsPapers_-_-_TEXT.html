We worked to recreate the formation of nanotubes, and we did it!
PY79 cells were grown to midexponential phase, plated on LB agar, incubated for 6 hr at 37°C, and visualized by SEM Rej34 circles: (A) Bacillus subtilis cells(x 7,500). The red circles indicate intercellular nanotubes connecting neighboring cells. The scale bar represents 1 micrometer.
We obtain one AND final product:
Compilation of newspapers where our BioSintetizARTE 2.0 call was published.
The UNAM Genomics Mexico Team is pleased to introduce to you the BioSintetizARTE call, this call its quite important because our team is really concern about the important role of citizen involvement where all views can find expression and the diversity of languages specially through the universal language... the ART.
We launch our call on August 1st all over Mexico trying to find all views we can get in order to have a more colorful landscape of Synthetic Biology. This are some of the newspapers where our call was published all over Mexico.
Newspaper "El Manana" published 1 august 2012 visible in all Mexico
Newspaper "El Sol de Tampico" published 1 august 2012 visible in North East of Mexico
