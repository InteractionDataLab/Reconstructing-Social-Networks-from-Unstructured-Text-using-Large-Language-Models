Kena Enriquez - Proyecto MAPEO
“Proyecto MAPEO” by Kena Enriquez, 2012.
The mapping project has its origin in the record of images of my body  and as organic material human skin, being this a symbol of uncertainty and vulnerability.
In these records I retake the bacteria that invade the skin as an opportunity to explore various forms of representation and communication. Here I question  the progress of the human form and life, changing their visual perception processes questioning evolution, memory and creation, this creates a new alternative meat and skin modified by manipulating bits, of images that become audio, video edited as an animation, in this case the computer is not only technology but takes the living matter of the images that coexists with us and record its modified process.
