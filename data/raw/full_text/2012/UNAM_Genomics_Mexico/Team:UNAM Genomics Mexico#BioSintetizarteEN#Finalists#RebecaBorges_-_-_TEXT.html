Rebeca Borges Vector Pop
“Vector Pop” by Rebeca Borges Monroy. Acrílicos, 2012.
A vector is a small piece of DNA in which a fragment of DNA can be transferred from one organism to another. It is an essential tool in synthetic biology, this because through these, foreign genes are inserted to the nucleus of cells, as it could be a bacteria that will perform a specific function. Generally these vectors are represented by circles which are marked in boxes and arrows, which represent different parts that come into the vector and promoters, a part, may be GFP ("green fluorescent protein"), which encodes a protein that marks an organism with a green fluorescent; important tool in biology.
One purpose in synthetic biology is to standardize biological parts, so as to facilitate the engineering of organisms so that people can easily use parts built by other groups. That is why this work represents different types of vectors in a repetitive manner: basic pop art, representing the standardization of these parts and the processes that use them. However, each vector is unique in color and parts, as each vector encodes something different, has a different use and is special, encoding either degrade oil resistant paint a picture, or encode for a fertilizer.
The bright colors and childish paths represent in what stage is synthetic biology. This is a new area of biology that gradually develops.
