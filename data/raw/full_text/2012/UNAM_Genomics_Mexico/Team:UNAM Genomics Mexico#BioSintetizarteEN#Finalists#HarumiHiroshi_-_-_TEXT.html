Harumi Hiroshi - Planta madre
Harumi Hiroshi - Y en el principio Dios...
“Planta Madre” by Harumi Hiroshi, 2012.
For this project I will realize a sculpture based on the elements that constitute a motherboard.
As a student of arts, I manage a not very broad vision about the term, however I understand at a basic level synthetic biology as that given convergence between life sciences and new technologies.
When mentioning the word technology, many people would come to mind a computer, that's why I chose the motherboard as the main material of this piece because it is what allows the programming and control of one of the most important devices if we are talking about technologies. I integrated plants to the sculpture that refer to the study of living things and together these materials give an idea of what is actually synthetic biology, programming and construction of living beings.
Synthetic biology seems a very exciting area of research because it’s not only know and analyze the existing agencies but is also to have the power to create new ones, the ability to play being God, or maybe not, because this is not a game.
"Y en el principio Dios..."
For this project I will realize a Chinese ink based paint representing unicellular organisms.
As a student of arts, I manage a not very broad vision about the term, however I understand at a basic level synthetic biology as that given convergence between life sciences and new technologies.
One of the new technologies of this time is the computer and its language is the binary system. I want to represent unicellular organisms which are the primary unit cell of the study of biology and I´m going to write the words of the biblical text of Apocalypse  4: 11 "Lord, You are worthy to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things , and for thy pleasure they are and were created ",  I will write it in binary because it represents technology in synthetic biology, the irony of these words communicated through language of a machine. I want to refer roughly to what this science is, not just programming, coding and analyzing but also to create new beings and the dilemma that entails. The collision and the contradiction of these concepts both religious sense as science make this piece, the possibility of playing being "God".
