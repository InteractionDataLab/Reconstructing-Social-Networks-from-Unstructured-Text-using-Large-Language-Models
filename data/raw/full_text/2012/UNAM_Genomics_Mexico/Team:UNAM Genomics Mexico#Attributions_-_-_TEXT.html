Here we are the Super UNAM Genomics TEAM :) everybody is a hard worker
All work on this project was done by members of the UNAM_Genomics_Mexico's 2012 iGEM Team. Original constructs from which to obtain P4 gene and A3 promoter to Biobrick were supplied by Dr. Margarita Salas from Autonomous University of Madrid. Bacillus subtilis strains were provided by Dr. Ben-Yehuda from School of Medicine-IMRIC, Dr. Gabriela Olmedo from Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute (CINVESTAV,IPN)  Campus Irapuato and  Dr. Guillermo Gosset from Biotechnology Institute (IBT, UNAM). Supervision and direction was provided by  members of the Center for Genomic Sciences, (CCG) however all work was done by the team, during the months of May 2012 to present. Most work was developed in the CCG from National Autonomous University of México (UNAM). Part of the work with Bacillus subtillis was done in CINVESTAV Campus Irapuato. Special thanks to Amhed Missael Vargas Velazquez for his support with MATLAB®, Dr. Otto Geiger for allowing us to use its lab at CCG to work with the OR and the Sweet AND and to Dr. Gabriela Olmedo for her help with Bacillus subtilis. Also  Dr. Fernando García from The Cellular Physiology Department of UNAM that helped us with the SEM Analysis and  Alfonso Leija,PhD from the Functional Genomics of Eukaryotes Research Program  at Center of Genomic Sciences, who helped us with parts characterization.
