Ana  Karen Mojica - La mujer Fotosintetica
“La mujer fotosintetica” by Ana Karen Mojica, 2012.
In a world where humans have endeavored to destroy everything around us, science seems to be our only salvation, if I could use synthetic biology for something I would create humans able to photosynthesize, this way helping our planet be a better place.
