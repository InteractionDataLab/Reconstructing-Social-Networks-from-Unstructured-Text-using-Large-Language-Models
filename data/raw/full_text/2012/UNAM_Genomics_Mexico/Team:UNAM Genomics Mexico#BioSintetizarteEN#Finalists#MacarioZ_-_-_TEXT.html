Macario Garcia Zeta - Genetic  Sintetic Genesis versus Apoptosis
Macario Garcia Zeta - Genetic  Sintetic Genesis versus Apoptosis
Macario Garcia Zeta - Genetic  Sintetic Genesis versus Apoptosis
“Genetic  Sintetic Genesis versus Apoptosis” by Macario Garcia Zeta, 2012.
Death lives in our body in every cell of our bodies are programmed to perish quietly and orderly at the precise moment, an example is the differentiation of human fingers during embryonic development that requires that cells intermediate membranes, initiate the apoptotic process so that the fingers can be separated.
This term suggested  me to think by a number of Digital Graphics on the possibility of creating a synthetic agent or cell body that I call Genesis and that if it existed, should be able to revert, or genetically and synthetically regulate organ development and its cell programmed death which apparently has been possible.
Apoptosis, the aforementioned biochemical process destroys the myth of natural death, the evidence comes to light through the autopsy, the failure of a specific organ.
Synthetic biology has created new hope as art, in places where apparently all is said, that is why the need to continue creating through the aesthetics and science, new strategies that eventually collapse paradigms.
