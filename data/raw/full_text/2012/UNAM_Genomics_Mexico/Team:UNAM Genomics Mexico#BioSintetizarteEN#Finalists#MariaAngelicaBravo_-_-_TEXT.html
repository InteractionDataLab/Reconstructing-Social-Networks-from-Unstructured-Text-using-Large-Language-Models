Maria Angelica Bravo - Transgenic Gummy Bear Force
“Transgenic Gummy Bear Force” by Maria Angelica Bravo, 2012.
Material: colored Gummy Bear
Description: Could synthetic biology make better individuals to become a threat to unmodified individuals? Could these new individuals become used for bad purposes as an army? Fear of people towards GMOs is what I’m trying to show you with this work. A real army of stronger organisms, with better skills, in the hands of people who would not use them to do good things, would be detrimental to the future of the world.
