Hector Medina - I spy with my little eye
“I spy with my little eye” by Hector Medina, 2012.
This image shows a close-up of the eye of a synthetic green bottle fly, where the legend "404 FACE.APP NOT FOUND". The 404 code is the error reported when something is not found on the system, typically on web-servers. As for FACE, this makes a reference to a rather famous internet website known for being a great gossip exchange platform. Finally, the . APP should remind the viewer of the tremendous growth that smaller usually poorly-built applets have had, in detriment of bigger and better built programs.
Overall, the goal of the piece is to show a possible future where even flies serve as paparazzi tools, even though they are poorly built as the synbio tools were used in a haphazard way. This transgenic fly is a human creation, and thus it may evoke the ephemeral nature of concepts such as Privacy, Natural, and even original, as all are subject to the economic interest that prevail in that setting. Finally, the left legend should open on a question: which is the role of those disciplines, what do them share and what makes them different? Are they synonymous?
