Hector Ruiz Sistema Artificial
“Sistema Artificial” by Hector Ruiz, 2012.
“Artificial system” are Digital graphs, drawings anf pictures which are animated as a biological system that does not exist naturally. In this artificial construction, the concept is to use parts that simulate movement and life. These designs behave better in digital systems terms.  A reason for this, is that those systems create an “abstraction barrier” between physics of mechanisms level and the design and operation systems level.
The audio is determined by the frequency rhythm of graphs movement which were designed
