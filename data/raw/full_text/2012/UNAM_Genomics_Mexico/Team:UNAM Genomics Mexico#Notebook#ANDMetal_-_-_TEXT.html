05/29/2012
Our group is in charge of building part of the “and” construction. We started analyzing if the plasmid we have with P4 actually had what we needed.
The plasmid PRMn25 contains the protein P4. It has Amp100  resistance and comes in Escherichia coli NFI. Cells were lysed to make sure the plasmid was present in these cells (5000bp). We ran a gel with 3 lysis, a sample from the plasmid PFRC54 (A3 promoter) and a sample of total DNA from the strain from which PFRC54 was obtained.

Plasmid PRMn25 was digested with SpeI and EcoRI. We do not have the sequence of the plasmid, but there seem to be several restriction sites for SpeI and just one site for EcoRI. The digestions were left for 4 hours and they were plused in the microwave 3 times, 10 seconds each time. Only Dulce’s digestion worked, even though it was the “dirtiest” sample.

PRMn25 was digested with EcoRi and BamHI. Since we don’t have the sequence we used these enzyme to confirm the restriction sites mentioned in Rojo et al. (1990). These sites were corroborated and the vector was linearized. We recycled the gel used for the PRMn25 lysis, which is why the gel seems out of phase.

The lysis worked so we transformed PRMn25 in DH5α. We performed a lysis on these cells to see if they had been transformed correctly with PRMn25.
We also transformed PFRC54. TRANSFORMATION PROTOCOL

We designed primers for our project. (Note from 07/10/12: we redesigned the primer for LasR, since the sequence was incorrect.)

06/14/2012
We obtained the terminator from the 2012 distribution (plate 2 24C) and we transformed the DNA in DH5α TRANSFORMATION PROTOCOL . The terminator (BBa_B0014) comes in the PSBIAK3 plasmid with resistance to Amp and Km. The RFP (BBa_E1010) comes in the plasmid PSBI2K3 with resistance to Amp and we obtained it from the 2012 distribution plate 2 (17E). We obtained the purified plasmid of the RFP from the AraC AND team. (Diego, Jonathan, and Abiel).

07/02/12
We did 2 PCRs, since the primers have arrived. We purified by miniprep RFP and P4. With this PCR we will add the prefix (EcoRI and XbaI) and RBS to the beginning of the sequence, and suffix (restiction sites for SpeI asn PstI).

Taking into account both TM’s, we used the same amplification program for both, thermocycle B progam iGEM.
We ran a gel and we observed fragments that correspond to the RFP and P4, we can also observe other fragments which means we will have to purify the bands.

We ran LasR’s PCRs again, the last PCR didn’t work, which is why we lowered the temperature to 65ºC. We left the digestions all night. PCR PROTOCOL
Since they didn’t work, we decided to do it directly from the distribution from 2012 and 2010.
We noticed our mistake…. The sequence we designed our primers for was an incorrect sequence!
We need to redo LasR primers.
Our ligation didn’t work.
We redid RFP+terminator ligation and left it for the weekend. LIGATION PROTOCOL

We did another PCR of RFP because we ran out of it.
We ran a gel with the dephosphated terminator and digested RFP.

>We transformed yesterday’s ligation in DH5α and plated it in LB Km30. Since our ligations have not worked we decided to redo the digestions on the terminator (E0014). We asked the other AND team to give us the purified plasmid, but it wasn’t enough so we streaked 2 plates LB Km30 so we could have the strain with the terminator. Tomorrow we will put liquid cultures and do lysis.
>We did digestions in another vector to see the efficiency of the enzymes as a test. We used PBBR-GusA with 5 µl of PBBR GusA, one digestion with 1.5 µl of EcoRI, one with 1 µl of SpeI and one with 1 µl of SpeI and 1.5 µl of EcoRI.
We left them at 37ºC.
