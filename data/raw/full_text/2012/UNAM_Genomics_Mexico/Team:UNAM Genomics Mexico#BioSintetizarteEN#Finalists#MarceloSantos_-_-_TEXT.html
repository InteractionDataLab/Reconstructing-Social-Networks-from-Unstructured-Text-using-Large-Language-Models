Marcelo Santos - BioLED BioTV
“BioLED BioTV ” by Marcelo Santos, 2012.
The illustration is a characterization of three organisms, which have the function of projecting light whenever they eat each of them being fed by controlled amounts of energy or any other substance or material required, project a color. Through being programmed and coupled to million more like them, they do the work that the LEDs currently make on TVs or displays. That's why their colors are red, green and blue as they are the colors that generate light and are necessary for its projection.
I do not know the scope of synthetic biology, but I think through it can make better environmental substantial, same as the style and quality of human life.
