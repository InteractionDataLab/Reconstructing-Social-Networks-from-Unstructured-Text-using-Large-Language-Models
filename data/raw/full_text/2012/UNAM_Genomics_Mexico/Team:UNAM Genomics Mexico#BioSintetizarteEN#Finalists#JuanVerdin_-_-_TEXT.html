Juan Manuel Vazquez - Auto-sintetis
“Auto-sintetis ” by Juan Manuel Vazquez, 2012.
The work represents at the beginning, what shapes us, the DNA as the basis for building a human being that emerges based on its instructions. At that arise and evolution his arm extends curving, representing all the adventure of mankind since biological systems were considered as completely mechanical systems, such as pieces of watches. The adventure continues with the discovery of the heredity laws and after with the molecules involved in these systems. All the mix converges in a pipette, unmistakable symbol of modern biology, transforming bacteria. This adventure culminates in that transformation in which a new arm of a completely different human being, with more capabilities and less defects is transforming itself from its own DNA. Because in the end, this is one of the main goals of synthetic biology, achieve transformation of ourselves to have better biological characteristics and to face the changes that always occur in nature without having to wait for natural selection to do its job.
