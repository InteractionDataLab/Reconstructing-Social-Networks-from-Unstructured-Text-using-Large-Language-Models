A3- LasB (GFP REPORTER) OR GATE
This construct was designed to function as an OR logic gate. Our system consists in two different promoters (A3 and  LasB) expressing the same reporter gene (GFP). LasB (BBa_R0079) promoter (used by NYMU-Taipei 2009, Northwestern 2011, Tokyo-tech iGEM 2011 and Tsinghua-A 2011) requires both an activator protein, LasR, and an N-acylhomoserine lactone compound termed Pseudomonas autoinducer (PAI). A3 promoter is activated by P4, a regulatory protein from phage φ29 from Bacillus subtilis. In this way, if our target cell receive either LasR, P4 or both proteins, it will express GFP protein and we will have an OR gate.
To obtain our final construct we required the following Biological Parts:
Obtained from the Registry:
BBa_K143001 (AmyE 5’)
BBa_K143002 (AmyE 3’)
BBa_R0079 (LasB)
BBa_B0014 (Double Terminator)
Obtained from Margarita Salas Ph.D.’s Group:
A3 from phage phi29 from plasmid pFRC54.
Omega cassette from plasmid pHP45Ω.
GFP reporter gene
We designed the following primers to add the RBS site to GusA:

This A3-LasB OR team had to build the following constructs
So we could obtain the final product:
