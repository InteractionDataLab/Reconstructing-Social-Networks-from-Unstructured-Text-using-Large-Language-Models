Mariana Ruiz - Escherichia Drug-li
“Escherichia Drug-li” by Mariana Ruiz, 2012.
Material: solid polymer base covered with fabric and paper, coated metal contractile extensions of colored thread and cotton balls derivatives with translucent plastic strips.
Description: In the early twentieth century, millions of people around the world had a very low quality of life to be diagnosed with diabetes. Efforts to understand the causes of this disease, to propose possible cures, were many. In 1921 insulin was discovered, it was attempted to be administered in diabetic patients but the impurity was such extreme, that it could represent a potential danger and not a help. It wasn’t until 1977 that there was a revolution in the history of medicine:  genetically modified bacteria could produce human insulin in the organism Escherichia coli. Moreover, this protein could be extracted in a clean form, without representing health risks.
Since then, a new chapter in medicine and scientific research was opened. Many other diseases have benefited from the so-called synthetic biology, an example is HIV and hepatitis. Possible applications are emerging every day, ranging from the production of antibiotics and vaccines, to regenerative medicine and therapies to fight cancer.
My work attempts to show in a tangible way, the synergy between medicine and synthetic biology through a hybrid Escherichia coli-drug capsule. In my model I try to represent the interior of both parts:  bacteria with its genome (DNA) and the drug inside the cell with its granules.
The motivation I find to make this sculpture is my admiration for the scientific discoveries that have led to improved health, treatment and lives of millions of people worldwide. Another major motivation is to spread synthetic biology as an unparalleled source for solving problems, not only for medicine, but for bioremediation, production of new energy sources and the development of new materials.
