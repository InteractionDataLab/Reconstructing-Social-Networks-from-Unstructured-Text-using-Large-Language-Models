Our group is in charge of building part of the ìandî construction. We started analyzing if the plasmid we have with P4 actually had what we needed.
The plasmid PRMn25 contains the protein P4. It has Amp100  resistance and comes in Escherichia coli NFI. Cells were lysed to make sure the plasmid was present in these cells (5000bp). We ran a gel with 3 lysis, a sample from the plasmid PFRC54 (A3 promoter) and a sample of total DNA from the strain from which PFRC54 was obtained.

METAL
Plasmid PRMn25 was digested with SpeI and EcoRI. We do not have the sequence of the plasmid, but there seem to be several restriction sites for SpeI and just one site for EcoRI. The digestions were left for 4 hours and they were plused in the microwave 3 times, 10 seconds each time. Only Dulceís digestion worked, even though it was the ìdirtiestî sample.

PRMn25 was digested with EcoRi and BamHI. Since we donít have the sequence we used these enzyme to confirm the restriction sites mentioned in Rojo et al. (1990). These sites were corroborated and the vector was linearized. We recycled the gel used for the PRMn25 lysis, which is why the gel seems out of phase.

The terminator (BBa_B0014) comes in the PSBIAK3 plasmid with resistance to Amp and Km. The RFP (BBa_E1010) comes in the plasmid PSBI2K3 with resistance to Amp and we obtained it from the 2012 distribution plate 2 (17E). We obtained the purified plasmid of the RFP from the AraC AND team. (Diego, Jonathan, and Abiel).
