Meetings
Tuesday March 6th
Presentation of Research Results in our internal Wiki
General Remarks
1. Prof. Skerra recommended to stick to a consistent structure when presenting research results.
Short summary of what you are about to say (e.g. "AlcR is a simple two component system from aspergilus nidulans which can be induced with ethanol")
Give detailed information, such as: nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence, Link to PDB-entry, ...
Last but not least, Your personal view & comments
Please make sure to update your entries to match this structure
2. There are some general arguments in favor of our project idea. One of them is, that the application of genetically modified yeast should be legal, because beer is filtered anyway, so no GMOs would be released from the closed system.
Promoters
Ethanol-inducible Promoters
KlADH4-Promoter
The information given in our wiki was presented. The main question discussed was whether this system works specifically (similar to the lac-operon) or unspecifically (similar to a general stress response). If the system works specifically, it is unlikely that the KlADH4 promoter is going to work in S. cerevisiae, because in this case, an unknown specific transcription factor is most likely involved which is not present in s. cerevisiae. If the system works unspecific, we thought that only general stress factors and transcription factors are involved. In this case, chances are that KlADH4 can work in s. cerevisiae, because the necessary factors are most likely present. However, we don't know for sure which mechanism is the correct one (specific or unspecific). Therefore further literature research is necessary for this system.
AlcR-Promoter
The information given in our wiki was presented. The system might be a good candidate, because it seems to be well characterized. Because we do not know many details about this system, further literature research is necessary for this system.
Methanol-Inducible Promoter from Pichia pastoris, and methanol inducible systems from prokarya, such as Methylococcus capsulatis (BATH)
During the discussion about ethanol-inducible systems, two additional suggestions were made.  The yeast pichia pastoris is known for its ability to express recombinant proteins upon methanol induction. Maybe this system can be adapted to respond to ethanol - apparently it is based on a specific methanol binding transcription factor. Further literature research is necessary. Also, there is a variety of bacteria which can grow with alcohols (e.g. methanol) as carbon source (Methylococcus capsulatis (BATH)). Maybe they can also provide a system for S. cerevisiae. Further literature research is necessary.
Inducible Yeast Promoters
Chemical Induction: Last year, the iGEM team [ British Columbia 2011 ] created the BioBrick BBa_K517000. This is a Galactose-inducible yeast-promoter which worked for them.
There is a light-switchable promoter system for yeast which has been shown to work for example in a PhD-thesis. See Project Ideas for details. The fact that short light pulses instead of continuous radiation is sufficient to induce expression is an advantage, because light can destroy flavors.
Biosynthesis of small molecules
Resveratrol
There are two approaches for the synthesis of resveratrol, but both require the intermediate Coumaryl-CoA. The 2008 iGEM-Team from  [ iGEM Rice 2008 ] tried to submit the resveratrol synthesis pathway in yeast to the registry, but their BioBricks are not functional (for example, they still include forbidden restriction sites). However, the basic functionality of their construct has been shown to work by a different research lab. It would be a good idea to use the DNA they submitted to the registry and make it functional (e.g. removing the forbidden restriction sites...), because this is a great way to improve an already existing BioBrick, which is one of the things iGEM judges really like to see. Volker has already contacted them and got a friendly response.
Xanthohumol
Xanthohumol has never been produced in yeast. However, attempts have been made to alter the hops plant to increase its production of xanthohumol, which shows that beer with increased concentration of xanthohumol is a great idea. Two of the required genes have been well characterized, the other two haven't. The biosynthesis of xanthohumol also includes the intermediate Coumaryl-CoA.
Raspberry Ketone
The synthesis of Raspberry Ketone also includes Coumaryl-CoA.
Caffeine
Caffeine has never been produced in yeast. The required substrate for the synthesis occurs naturally in yeast, because it is a part of the nucleic acid metabolism. Two genes are required for synthesis of caffeine. Caffeine has been shown to inhibit growth of bacteria and yeasts at concentrations similar to that in coffee.
Aspirin
No enzymes are known which produce aspirin.
Nicotine
We decided against the production of nicotine for moral reasons. Our beer should be a healthy one.
Strawberry flavor
Strawberry flavor is not one single substance but a mixture of several hundreds. However, peach-flavor has been produced in yeast already. For interview teams: Ask Prof. Schwab about Furaneol (Dimethylfuraneol)!
Colors and pigments
In addition to the information given in our wiki, please look at [ iGem 2011 Uppsala ].
Beneficial Peptides and Proteins
The general question concerning Peptides and Proteins is how to ensure their secretion in yeast.
Knottins
Knottins do not fit our requirements well.
Thaumatin
The protein thaumatin is a natural sweetener. Its production should be easy, because only one gene is required.
Lactoglobulin
the digestion of ß-Lactoglobulin exhibits a broad variety of physiological active peptides. How many genes are required?
Discussion & Next steps
Decision on structure of project
We decided to focus on the following modules in our project:
Promoters: Design a library containing three types of promoters: ethanol inducible (for EtOH-Sensor), light switchable and chemically inducible (for control of biosynthesis).
Biosynthesis: The main focus will be on products derived from Coumaryl-CoA, because it is an intermediate for many interesting molecules. In addition to this, we also want to try to establish caffeine-synthesis, because only two genes are required.
Proteins: The secretion of proteins is a good idea, because it will give us a third field of research. This module is promising, because it is likely to lead to easy successes (only one gene required for the production of thaumatin...)
Next Steps
Everybody should assign themselves to one of the following topics:
I) Detailed literature research
For one desired product/construct, find out exactly...
How many genes are required?
Which genes (including nucleotide sequence)?
How do we get the physical DNA (ask a research lab to send it to us, extract from organisms via PCR, synthesis...)?
Please post your results in the wiki
II) "Taskforce Vector Design"
This group should focus on how to transform yeast. Which vectors are available, what techniques are necessary,...? For example, look at the 2011 iGEM Teams John Hopkins and Britsh Columbia. They worked with yeast and got decent results.
Interviews
Interviews with experts will take place on Friday, March 9th. If you are interested in helping, please contact Lara Kuntz.
Miscellaneous
Does anybody know a student from "Brauereiwesen"? It might be good to have one on the team!
Tuesday March 20th
Overview
The main topics of the meeting were the interviews and the project structure. We agreed that everybody should research his/her topic until the next meeting in two weeks in order to get into the lab as soon as possible (beginning of April). Additionally, we should meet during a weekend (e.g. 15th of April) to work together for a whole day and to address issues such as fundraising and human practice.
We agreed on the following project structure:
Project structure
Promoter and regulation systems
1. Ethanol-inducible
2. Light-switchable
3. Chemically inducible
4. Constitutive active
Biosynthesis systems
1. Coumaryl-pathway
2. Limonene
3. Caffeine
4. Thaumatin
Interviews
1. Dr. Zankow, Beverage Oriented Biotechnology
Security issues
In general, brewing beer with genetically modified yeast should not be a problem as far as security is concerned. If we manage to brew a beer with our yeast it should be safe for us to drink it because the filtration process is very efficient. However, we should not let other people who are not part of the team drink the beer.
Dr. Zankow remarked that the filtration process might filter out resveratrol and that we should check how much resveratrol is still in the beer after filtration and whether it is functioning.
Alternative Project ideas suggested by Dr. Zankow:
Removal of mycotoxins that are found in the grain
Beer for a special group of patients (e.g. Celiac disease, Gout)
nonalcoholic beer: since nonalcoholic beer does not taste as “satisfying” as normal beer, breweries are searching for something that adds taste to nonalcoholic beer. Dr. Zankow suggested Lactic acid
We are allowed to use the equipment of the chair to brew the beer.
2. Prof. Schwab, Biotechnology of Natural Products
He also made several suggestions for possible syntheses
Eugenol (clove-like aroma)
Limonene
According to him, strawberry aroma is very difficult to make
Prof. Schwab can give use information on several pathways, e.g. for limonene
3. Prof. Hofmann
He was quite critical about resveratrol since only 1 % of the substance is actually functional in the body. Therefore a large amount of resveratrol is necessary to produce a positive effect.
He has mass spectrometers that we are allowed to use, protocols for analyzing beer are available and we can do as many analyses as we want to. Only 5 µl are needed for one analysis.
More detailed information on the interviews are to be posted soon by the interviewers.
Fundraising
Lara talked to Prof. Herrmann and he is willing to give us money. We should send a specification of costs to his secretary.
Another possible source could be the excellence cluster.
Human Practice
We should use the contacts from the team from last year (e.g. Spiegel). We briefly talked about other institutions that could help us to get some publicity:
Carl von Linde Akademie

TO DO
research the topic you have chosen until the next meeting in 2 weeks! (enzymes, sequences, sources etc.)
Wednesday April 4th
Overview
The main aim of the meeting was to collect all information we gained and to know how we will move on in the laboratory. In some points we are able to order BioBricks already, but nevertheless more information are needed.
People: Volker, Georg, Jeffrey, Mary, Simon, David, Ingmar
Human Resources / General topics
19 Members are in the list (Wiki) and as soon as the semester starts (next meeting) hopefully everyone can come to the meetings.
We will need a brewer -> Georg will ask Hr. Zankhof if some students of his group are interested and Georg will also send an email at the 'Studienkoordination Brauwesen' if some like to join our group. Nevertheless: Does anyone of you know a brewer-student?? Please keep that in mind. Same with Product-&Mediendesign, does anyone knows a student in this field? Will be very helpful in a couple of weeks!
On the Mailing list, everybody of the wiki-list is included (thanks to Fabian) - you already got an email. Fabian will also create an iGem-Emailadress.
Please register at the iGEM-Homepage ! See also the link on the main page (registration on iGEM) After everybody registered, Prof. Skerra will accept us and the team is complete (so no code is needed).
Prof. Skerra ordered an computer for us, it will be in the lab of Prof. Skerra. He also recommends to use the program APE for DNA editing.
On the  Saturday we will work together (remember the doodle), Volker will give us a basic introduction of how to check if the BioBricks we like to order for our experiments are okay and working.
Projects
Light-inducible Promoter (Jeffrey)
this project could also act as an independent project (For example if the yeast modification does not work)
BioBricks needed are available -> order them!  circuitry (Logic gates) as a model to explain
Chromophore adding instead of producing it (for the first steps) Fusionprotein GAL4+Phyb is available in registry  Measuring with FRET
Conclusion:  we know everything we need -> ordering BioBricks -> laboratory  -> next step: Two persons need to go through the idea with Jeffrey again & help him! -> more data search needed: Sequences where proteins bind
Constitutive Promoters (Georg)
promoters already done in iGEM -> look at team site of those projects  behavior of promoters depending on glucose-concentration (the table Georg uploaded in Wiki is important)  -> what else is changing during the brewery-process?
Conclusion:  asking Prof. Schwab about plasmids with constitutive promoters If constitutive promoters are needed later on -> look in the databases (wiki) or find in registry (Kits available?)
Ethanol-inducible Promoter (Simon)
see details in wiki does not seem difficult -> paper  asked Prof. Scherer for different microorganisms
AlcA-promoter in registry available -> BBa_K678001 -> ordering of BioBricks
Coumaryl-CoA (Ingmar)
Pathway from Phenylalanin to Comaryl-CoA does exist! (Prof. Schwab)  See interview of Prof. Schwab (David, Volker) -> what could we use from Prof. Schwab? (Roman) -> More data research needed: which products are interesting? story to sell this kind of beer?
Next steps
Next meeting: Mo 16.4.2012   18.00
it is now very important that everybody who likes to participate and likes to bring this project forward will attend at this meeting after the semester break!
in the protocol there are some points on which we have to do more data search - please get involved in these subjects and tell us the results in the wiki.
Monday April 16th
Organisation
Round of Introductions
Since most of us didn't know each other yet, we did a short round to introduce ourselves. This will hopefully be continued Saturday evening @teambuilding.
Press
jetzt.de contacted us to do an interview about last years iGem project, but as we told them we are participating this year again they will feature this years project as well. Simon did the interview on 17.04.
Logo
We showed the 5 ideas for the logo that were also uploaded to the wiki and had a poll on which logo to use as a first design idea:
Logo I
Logo II
Logo III
Logo IV
Logo V
9 Votes
1 Vote
0 Votes
0 Votes
12 Votes
Final decision was to work on Logo V.
Additionally we decided that Jeffs Idea runs out of concurrence and could be used for the wiki design.
Vector Graphics will be created by Dennis
Maybe someone knows a Mediendesign student who would like to join the team ?
Ideas for the logo design:
keep it simple
banderole thinner
outer oval in bavarian blue/white pattern
use the weihenstephaner logo for the upper part of the bottle
Comments by Prof. Skerra
Sponsoring Letter
Sell the beer brewing idea more as a working example than as the main idea to make the project more generally acceptable
Prof. Skerra improved some parts of the sponsoring letters and is open to give more advice
Work on the website
Put the group photo online
Add more information
Research
Prof. Schwab
Send a mail to Roman with the names of the enzymes that we need (trivial name is sufficient)
We also thought about the option to implement more of his ideas but rejected this notion since we already have sufficient nice ideas to work on.
Coumaryl
List of required genes to Roman. Please copy-paste Information to the new page on the wiki!
Limonene
Mail to Prof. Schwab: Is the one enzyme that we suppose to be sufficient really enough?
Caffeine
2-3 Enzymes (we will use the pathway that uses 3 since it seems more realistic to work) Roman contacted the authors of some papers but did not get any response from them so we do not know how we will obtain the genes.
Gene synthesis is possible (3k bp) but it is questionable whether it is really worth the effort since pathway is rather complicated and concentrations will most likely not reach physiologically active concentrations.
Thaumatin
2 other sweet substances are already available as biobricks but their potency is questionable.
The gene Thaumatin is, as most of the other genes, not BBRFC10 compatible but this does not really pose a problem since it is easily fixable by quickchange mutagenesis.
Gene Synthesis
It is probably very time efficient to synthesize some genes, therefore we need to check what is the cheapest/fastest solution here. Look at
Mr Gene : http://biomatik.com/CustomServices/CustomGene/Gene-Synthesis.aspx
Check the iGEM Sponsors : https://2012.igem.org/Sponsors  ?
Last years team : Mr Gene as far as I can tell (Fabian)
Promoters
Simon will begin working on the KlADH4 system next week and use a chemical inducible promoter for the required components.
Saturday
We will meet Saturday 21.4.2012 at 14:00 at the Seminar room to do an in-depth research afternoon.
Agenda idea:
Find Research/Lab Groups
Tour through the lab
Introduction on what to pay attention when working with BioBricks
Research in smaller groups
BRING LAPTOPS!
Afterwards we will eat something and have a beer!
Saturday April 21th
Introduction by Volker into BioBicks and Methods
Quick introduction by Volker on BioBrick RFC10 & RFC25, Codon usage
Team forming
We split up into groups to do research in smaller groups. these groups will also realize the sub project so everybody who was not present please select a group an check with the group-leader.
We met in these smaller groups and only report our progress in the main meetings.
Next Meeting
The time for the next meetings will be Tuesday 20:00. next date for the meeting will be May 1rst.
Ideas
Human Practice
We need to come up with something new and fancy
Interviews : not new
Panel Diskussion : very time consuming
TV - Galileo : we need to check
Create a blog : last year HP price was awarded for a blog

Teambuilding at Huber in Freising
Tuesday May 1st
General
To Do List
The photo of our group ought to be placed on our website: iGEM 2012
We should have a small team, which cares about the formulation of abstracts and project descriptions concerning our experiments and ideas in order to put that on our website
The formulated sponsoring- letters should be uploaded in our wiki, to make them available for everyone
@ Sponsoring- Team: When do you send out the letters?
At the next meeting (15.5.2012, 20:00): Skype- Conversation with the student of Stuttgart (who wants to refer to us in her masters thesis)
Prof. Skerra will be contacted concerning the following issues:
general health and safety briefing
outstanding team- applications (at the official iGEM Website)
getting contact to people who have experience in working with yeast (especially in transformation with multiple genes, genome integration and heterologous expression) and would give as a "crash course"
Contact Prof. Schwab on Monday, May 7th, after his lecture "metabolic engineering and production of natural compounds" (also for getting a "crash course" / good literature concerning yeast etc.)
everyone of us should acquire general knowledge concerning transcription and translation in yeast (e.g. ribosome binding site, etc.)
David should get a list with required chemicals and other stuff, we will need / perhaps need in the lab (for our sponsors)
If anyone of us has / had personal contacts to enterprises in the field of biochemistry/ molecular biology etc., please tell David
Get contact to the foundation that supported/ supports Team Heidelberg
@ Volker: Can you put some general information (e.g. concerning primer- design) in our wiki?(e.g. regarding primer- design, etc.)
Each team should make a list of the required BioBricks, sequences (to be synthesized - eventually codon optimized and with standard compatibility), and primers (sequences one wants to amplify, respectively, that primers can be designed) and give it to Volker (further required BioBricks can be put on the existing list ( click here ) in our wiki, respectively) until Friday, May 4th., for the order of the BioBricks should be arranged in the next days
Sub- Team Reports
Human Practice / Press / Video
(Jara)
List of appropriate magazines, which could report on us:
SNIP- Magazine (the chief editor happens to be my (Roman) cohabitant, so i could care about that)
Zeit Wissen and Zeit Campus
Freisinger Tagblatt
Biospectrum
Transcript
Efellows
after a few weeks and results (hopefully): Sueddeutsche Zeitung (again)
Galileo
if there are other ideas, tell Jara (e.g. SpiegelOnline, PM)
Video
Jara had the idea to make a video that looks like a beer- advertisement (bored people sitting in a beer garden, super yeast comes, giving them the new beer and happy end ... )
to realize this, we could contact the Filmhochschule München
Ethanol inducible promoter
(Simon)
Simon starts with this part of our project on May, 2nd.
For now: simple yeast transformation experiment with GFP and pYES2 als vector system
Later: Amplification of a special promoter out of Kluyveromyces lactis
Light-inducible [romoter
(Jeff)
A PhD student will be contacted, in order to get some sequences
As described in the project description, this group wants to change the Gal4BD for LexA
Limonene
(Lara)
Lara could start in about 2 weeks with the labwork
The sequence is available at the chair of biotechnology of natural compounds (Prof. Schwab), but a few codons should be optimized. Besides it should be checked, if the sequence is complete (because the comparison of the available vector and the sequence on NCBI have not the same length (perhaps due to a his- tag))
Caffeine
(Roman)
Sequences can only be received by gene-synthesis
Sequences have to be codon optimzed and partially mutated due to forbidden restriction sites
Only the coding sequences will be used for amplification
This project will start later
Thaumatin
(Jonas)
This projects lab work can start soon, but since Jonas did not participate in the last meeting, further information will come at the next meeting
Next Meeting
We decided to continue the "main meeting" in a two weeks interval and determined May, 15th 20:00
Tuesday May 15th
Team logo
The first draft of the logo was edited. The letters should be written in “altdeutsch” to enhance the Bavarian effect.  Another concept was introduced: “tumb”eer with labels for the bottle front, back and the top. The different flavors/ingredients (caffeine, limonene, etc.) were symbolized by different colors. The idea was to present a beer in the future which is created by the consumer. It could be presented for the iGEM competition as a view for 2050.  However, the team-logo still needs to be designed.
Homepage
Martin will continue to work on the homepage and add the team picture.
Report by Roman
People of the institute of professor Schwab will participate in our team as advisors. They will receive accession to the Wiki and officially be registered for the iGEM ream.
Maybe the new advisors can offer a crash course in yeast-techniques. Complexity still needs to be defined. The most important issue would be the organization of yeast gene structures and the methods of selection. The genome integration and afterwards the selection is another important topic.
Team members need to read papers about gene co-expression in yeast!
Time is running out!
Bricking needs to be done soon, because it takes a lot of time.
Thaumatin, limonene and coumaryl could start very soon (1-2 weeks).
Caffeine needs to be synthesized.
Sponsoring
Many different sponsors are acquired. Most important is Eurofins, because they will synthesize oligonucleotides for 0,10 Euro per base. More information are in the sponsoring section
Gene synthesis
3 genes need to be synthesized for the caffeine team
2 genes might be needed for the thaumatin team (they might be able to get the genes from Heidelberg)
1 gene is necessary for the light-inducible promoter team
Final orders need to be posted in the sponsoring section
Lab work
Who has time? Timetable in internal wiki!
A clear defined agenda of your lab work should be made to show it Prof. Skerra. This is very important for your lab work, too!
Genes need to be ordered now or very soon. Otherwise we will run out of time!
Presentation of thaumatin
The presentation needs to be uploaded for everybody.
Introduction of the iGEM team to the institute
Idea: BBQ-night
BMBF
The invitation to Berlin was discussed and afterwards Martin, Lara and Volker were drawn to participate.
Public relations
Laborwelt will post news of our team on their website and in their newsletter. Possibly in the end of our project an article in their magazine will be published. Weekly updates, links and pictures are necessary for them.
Thursday May 24th
Organisational Issues
Team Instructors: Doreen Schiller (from Prof. Schwab's Department) already registered as an official team instructor for us. others may follow. Thanks to Roman for taking care of this!
Trip to Berlin: Fabian, Lara and Volker have been signed up to represent our team and present our project in Berlin on June 28th.
Barbecue: We will have a BBQ on June 5th, at 18:00 o'clock. Jara is the main contact for this. She should also get in touch with Klaus Wachinger to organize "Bierbänke" and everything else we need.
Our homepage www.igem2012.de should be updated. We also need a logo
Prof. Skerra made the following suggestions for the "Advertisement-Design" which Dennis presented previously (beer bottles): it should be "Alc 5.2" instead of "Alc 5,2, the name should be changed from "tumb" to "TUMbrew", the color of "glowing in the dark" should be changed to something greenish and this design (glowing in the dark) could/should be used as a first logo/picture on our homepage.
There will be a list with our inventory (excel-sheet)
Project
General Comments Prof. Skerra
The content is more important than the compatibility with iGEM standards
Don't forget regulatory elements
Find our about N-End-Rule
We should make a brainstorming seminar, where we discuss functional examples from the literature about co-expression of heterologous genes in yeast. When looking for DNA-Sequences, it also helps to make a "patent research", for example using the homepage of the EPA (europ. Patentamt), because in patents, the DNA-Sequences have to be shown!
In DNA sequences, the following unusual letters are used:
n = any nucleotide
y = pyrimidine (C, T)
r = purin (G, A)
When showing DNA-Sequences & designed primers, it is best to show two sequences (preferably a WORD-Document): One that shows what the final construct should look like and another one that shows the template DNA (usually a plasmid) and the primers you designed for the PCR. Also, you should know exactly which restriction enzymes you want to use for the cloning of your parts and why. Also have the GeneBank or Uniprot or PDB identifiers (codes) ready, so that you can easily show the respective enzymes.
Sub-Projects
Caffeine
Make one long, functional gene-synthesis that contains everything: the genes coding for all three enzymes, regulatory elements and restriction sites to allow for easy excision of each gene and cloning into plasmids.
Limonene
We have two sources for this:
A plasmid from Prof. Schwab. PCR will have to be done with this. This is lavendula limonene synthase
A Biobrick on the distribution plate (lemon limonene synthetase). Unfortunately, this part already contains an E. coli RBS, so we will also have to perform a PCR with this part.
Tuesday May 29th
"no protocol"
Tuesday June 5th
Primer design
3 enzymes were accepted by Prof. Skerra and could be ordered (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, limonene synthase, ???). We decided to order one primer pair with the consensus sequence and another without to prove whether the consensus sequence is necessary or not.
For those who have to design primers: the region that anneals to the gene should be 18 bases long and should contain 10 G/C’s. Furthermore the overhang should be 6 bases instead of only 5.
Everybody who designs a primer should consider how to detect the enzyme: enzyme assay, antibody detection  (abcam is a supplier of antibodies,you can look there for an appropriate antibody! A search engine exists as well…does anybody know the name???) or detection via tag (strep-tag or his-tag)
Primer purification
Primer that are longer than 60 bases should be purified
Co-expression of multiple genes in yeast
We need detailed information over multicistronic constructs in yeast! How is it done in other labs??? Look for papers and create a word document with sequence information and annotations.
Restriction sites
Restrictions sites inside a gene will be removed by quick change PCR after we proved the proper functionality
Lifetime of proteins
Look for the N-end rule.
Lab work
Saskia, Andrea, Lara and Daniela start working in the lab next week
Recruitment of a chemistry student to the team
Some enzymes may be detected via assays. Therefore we need different chemicals which may be produced by chemistry students during a practical course
Knowledge expansion of out team
Ingmar tries to recruit a chemistry student
Presentation by Jessica
this report is incomplete
Tuesday June 12th
Introduction of new approach for vector design by Volker
multiple cloning site is modified before cloning to fulfill iGEM standards
lab work aiming vector improvement starts June 13th (Saskia, Daniela)
primers have to be redesigned to match the new standard and have to be ordered AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
Planning of lab work
Quick change mutagenesis will be used to eliminate restriction sites that do not match iGEM standard
Meeting for lab members that will start their work this week: June 13th, 3 pm
Some groups got their primers approved by Prof. Skerra (Coumaryl), some need further planning (Thaumatin, Light-Inducible Promoter)
Primer design
Everyone should use the same stop codon (TAA)
6 bases should be added to the primer ends (not GCGCG, but rather another restriction site)
N-end rule
Groups should consider the N-end rule while planning their primers
If protein contains an glutamic acid or similar amino acid at the N-terminus, a small amino acid like alanine could be introduced N-terminally
this might lead to increase in protein stability!
check with information provided by Ingmar on the main page
Codon optimization
We have to look up a table containing codons preferred by yeast
Uli Binder (employee of Prof. Skerra) can be contacted concerning codon optimization
Also remember the online tool GCUA (Graphical Codon Usage Analyser) which can be found here: http://gcua.schoedl.de/
Lab book
Discussion about whether lab book should be digitally or handwritten
lab team that starts this week will use an ordinary lab book (one book each)
digitalisation must be discussed in next meeting!
Brewing process
our yeast strain is a top-fermented yeast. Top-fermented yeasts allow for fast brewing. BUT: Does our yeast grow in Gyle medium that is used in the brewing process?
our two new team members (brewing students) will contact Simon concerning the yeast strain and will start an experiment to get information about growth behavior of "our" yeast in Gyle medium
other things that need to be discussed:
Is a specialized brewing yeast strain available that is fully sequenced?
How can we make sure that the beer will be sterile and free of genetically engineered yeast?
pasteurisation does kill the yeast but does not eliminate the dead yeast cells
filtering might be a suitable approach, but oxygen will be lost and would have to be introduced afterwards
brewing students will contact a specialist of our university concerning filter techniques
it has to be checked whether the "Gentechnikgesetz" allows for dead genetically modified organisms or not
this report is possibly incomplete

Introduction
(Mary)
Our goal is Boston, project plans should help us getting us there. (Mary)
Project plans are necessary to communicate who is doing what and synchronise work. (Simon)
Lab-journal + Rules
(Mary + Simon)
Project coloring
One big Labbook
write an aim of experiment
Fabian will send a guide on how to name pictures
Gown is not always necessary, but please wear an igem badge
tomorrow: update the inventory list
is it okay to do an meeting agenda + documentation --> general yes
send ideas for meeting agenda to mary/simon or directly edit in the wiki
Lab-Reports + Project Plans
(Teamleader)
place project plans in the dropbox
Coumaryl
Cloning should be done next monday
One enzyme will be synthesized
Expression will be done in E. coli to test functionality, yeast is slower
Characterization in yeast should be done asap
Expression in possible problems in E. coli due to disulphide bridges
Quickchanges will be done later, focus is on results
Substrates for essays could be available at Schwab lab
Purification manual in the pYES2 kit / ask Doreen
Characterization and quickchanges should be done in parallel as purification can easily take over 2 weeks
Order primers! (Ingmar will do it)
Limonene
2 different enzymes
BioBrick: pcr done (add strep tag / RFC25 + removal of rbs)
ligation should start on monday
Schwab: miniprep did not work
ligation should start mid next week
Charactisation with gas-chromatographics (-> Stefan Gilch)/strep tag
Constitutive Promoters
BioBricks have some errors -> genome PCR is necessary
Expression will be done in BioBrick vector
pYES2 could be used as iGEM compatible shuttle vector without promoter, but removal of promoter + terminator is necessary
bad/none sequencing does not necessarily mean the brick will not work
primers will be orderded until Friday
primers need to be blasted against the whole genome
promoters should be ready in 2 weeks
Light-Inducible Promoter
Limiting factors: ordering of BioBricks + iGEM compatibility of pYES2
Bricks should arrive soon
will need constitutive promoters later on
for purification of phycocyanobilin some algae are needed
assembly should be done two weeks after arrival of all necessary parts
Thaumatin
Primers were not ordered due to miscommunications
eventuality not bad since synthesizing the gene makes more sense than ordering
this group can help other groups (or test mass-spectrometrics + brewing tests)
Jonas is missing - is he still in the team?
Caffeine
Promoters can be reduced in length but become more more ineffective
Annotation is bad
Synthesizing 9k bp takes very long and will be very expensive
Prof. Skerra himself is possibly against the long sequence
Plan is to synthesize all parts separately
clone separately/together
second AS after start codon is hard to be identified in 3D structure (Volker can help)
construct should be codon optimized / rna loop avoided
Vector Design
4 quickchanges were successful
1 Ala needs to be inserted
should be done on Friday
results should be available on Monday
Genome Integration
iGEM vector will cause some loss
Milestones
Expectations of last milestones were not met.
What do we want to realize until the next meeting?
Report: Brauerfragen + Experiments
(David H., Martin)
Sequenced (needed for genome integration) brewing yeast apparently not available (Ingmar will send a paper to Martin)
Report: Berlin
(Lara, Volker, Fabian)
Frankfurt is also doing an artificial sweetener in yeast
Interview with Mr. Laqua from Laborwelt
Common Project with all German Teams on August 25th
Poster for CAS-Conference
(Fabian)
Fabian will contact Dennis for the templates
Volker will do the abstract
Idea: Meet with politicians - Human Practice
(Volker/Fabian)
Contact politicians to inform about and discuss our project
Cooperation together with Laborwelt
Meet with experts and reflect (not new)
Inform politicians about biotechnology/synthetic biology (new) -~ discussion etc, Jara will make a concept
Film Making
Jara knows a student who will make a commercial with at the beginning of august
Mail to Prosieben was sent, waiting for a response
Idea: Invite a school class to do an experiment
(Nadine)
Nadine will determine possible 2-3 experiments
Prof Skerra wants a list of everything what we need
every group should send a list of required things to David

Discussed next meeting.
Next meeting (Wed. 9.00) + milestones
Tuesday July 10th
Present: Jeff, Alois, Andrea, Jara, Daniela, Nadine, Simon, Lara, Mary, Ingmar, Fabi, Martin, Georg
Missing: Volker, Roman, Dennis, Saskia (Freund Operation), Jonas, Katrin
Report: Lab + Milestones
(all)
Biobricks arrived
Simon will plate out tonight
pYES2
site restricted mutagenesis is finished
should work in yeast, possibly not working in bacteria due to mutagenesis in mu2 ori
please don't use up all of the vector in tube P50
Limonene
PCR finished
Ag1 is missing
can someone do the mini-prep on Saturday? (Alois/Martin)
Milestones:
until Monday next week: transformation in yeast characterization
Monday in 2 week: start characterization
strep tag -> Schwab GCMS analysis of products, ask Schwab/Gilch (substrates)
pSB1C3 RFC25 compatible
(assigned to jeff)
Volker will take care of the RFC25 compatible pSB1C3 (Potsdam/Freiburg or make on our own)
Remove rfc25 from pYES2 with rfc10 restriction sites and ligate into pSB1C3?
Jeff already did this with one part (->BBa_K105005 see Labbook)
Bricks with strep-tag cannot have this tag removed in pSB1C3
Coumaryl
Ligation can start tomorrow
One PCR has to be repeated again
Characterization should start next week
Needs certain educts which are either not available or very expensive
Ask people from papers/ Prof. Schwab
Subsequent production of educts is not realistic
Thaumatin/Caffeine
Synthesis is not ordered yet, they asked whether we want the synthesis in a pUC vector (better for >1kbp), should be ordered tomorrow
should arrive in 10 days
Constitutive Promoters
Digestion of bricks is done
Georg vaccinated his bricks
ADH promoter is correct
Prof. Skerra was not pleased with presentation
Light-Inducible Promoter
purification of phycocyanobilin started -> methanolyse in progress
Should be done on Friday
Jeff will start cloning tomorrow
Team Leader Meeting
(Mary)
What should we present in Amsterdam (Brewing with Limonene is realistic, but with Coumaryl probably not possible)
Tuesday 17:30 (tell Roman/Volker)
Chaos
If you are not sure how/what to do, ask before doing stupid things
Discussion: Do we want minimum requirements to go to Amsterdam/Boston and what should they be
Hard to differentiate between people who are working in the lab and outside -> number of days is possibly not a good idea
Attendance in Meetings (80%)
Excuse is necessary in advance nonetheless (for those 20%)
Note it in the wiki below the agenda
We will pay more attention to presence in lab
We will give a warning if people are not sufficiently present
Report: Brewing Questions (sequenced Yeast - potent?, experiments, ...?)
(Martin, Mary)
Only genome shotgunning is available, no whole genome sequence
We will test whether our lab strain will survive (-> Martin/Alois)
Hopefully their only disadvantage is that they will produce beer slower.
Introduction into Yeast Transformation / Proteinexpression in Yeast
(Simon, Katrin)
Add protocols to dropbox
Contact Simon as soon as you start doing something
Report: Cost listing and list of substances for enzyme assays
(all/David)
Just do it, send it to David asap.
School visit (24.07.12)
(Nadine)
who helps Nadine?
Jara will help

Tuesday July 17th - Meeting of group leaders
Attending: Simon, Mary, Volker, Georg, Jeff, Lara, Roman, Fabian, Dennis, Martin; Missing: Jonas
Prerequisites for medals
(Simon)
Bronze Medal
team registration
team wiki
poster and presentation at regional jamboree
new submitted and well characterized part (already accomplished)
Silver medal
functional BioBrick with registered function (should be quite easy)
Gold medal
At least one of the following criteria has to be achieved:
improvement of an existing BioBrick (limonene- team: RFC10 ==> RFC25)
help another team (e.g. cooperation with the team of Frankfurt?)
human practice
Theoretically we should get the gold medal. However, a gold medal does not necessarily lead into the final. It is important to focus on exact characterization and to submit it to the registry!
Aim: Special price?
To win a special price, the team has to come up with something special! Examples (i.a.):
Best measurement approach
E.g. cheap and easy methods for characterization
Best modelling
Best new biobrick (natural)
This biobrick should be something really crazy...
Best new biobrick (engineered)
E.g. light switchable promoter system. Each team leader is to think about his project - if there is potential to win one of the special prices, we can all help this team!
Best new standard
This does not necessarily mean the classical standards. It is also possible to focus on an improvement of existing procedures or of the interface of the registry, to make it more user-friendly (Volker has ideas)
Best poster
Best presentation
Best wiki
Last year's feedbacks
Rethink your characterizing experiments precisely (assays, etc.), think of positive and negative controls, etc. Ask Prof. Skerra or our advisers, when it comes to the characterization of your enzymes!
Application? Did you finish your project? That is to say, that it would be great if had brewed a beer at the end
Modelling: One negative thing last year was the fact, that the modelling based on literature data. We should link the modelling with the lab- work this year, so ask Fabian what data he will need.
Crowd founding: Platform already exists - we could create an own iGEM sub-folder
Track choice: There are several tracks and we have to choose one favored track (e.g. "food and energy") and a second one (which one?)
iGEM and Prof. Skerra
Run the fridge in the lab - already accomplished
Problem with lab work in the evening: There has to be present at least one member of the chair. Works on the computer are ok
Team status
Light-Switchable Promoter
Jeff has a lot of exams in the next days, he needs about 3 weeks. There were also some problems with "fake"- BioBricks of Harvard
Caffeine
Waiting for the gene synthesis. If received, it is realistic to proceed to the characterization
Thaumatin
Problems with the purification (strep tag is not possible due to secretion)
Limonene
Problems with remaining restriction sites
Coumaryl
There will be problems with the characterization, due to expensive substrates and the amount of enzymes.
The "big projects" will probably not exceed the expression, but there are smaller ones, which could
Important things to do
Concerning the brewers: reserve the equipment for limonene beer and thaumatin beer
Contact Georg concerning the required promoters
Make a yeast transformation with the integration vector (contains mOrange)
Tuesday July 17th
People: Jeff, Lara, Volker, Andrea, David, Ingmar, Saskia, Daniela, Dennis, Alois, Nadine, Jara, Martin, Katrin, Roman, Simon, Mary, Georg, Fabian

Lab Report + New milestones
(all)
Coumaryl
Milestone from last week: Improve Western Blot + Enzyme assays + Finish Quickchanges
Cloning: Quickchanges complete of: CHS, 4CL (1 missing), also sent to sequencing, all genes completely cloned in pYES2 and pSB1C3.
Correct sequences available in silico --> Can be added to registry
Characterization:
Expression of Enzymes: western blots were done, but ambiguous results. Find out optimum time for expression: Samples have been collected after 2, 5, 6, 8 hours, but western blot still has to be done. SDS-PAGE and western blot will be done by Daniela. Once we know a good time, we can make a 2 L batch so that we have enough enzyme for characterization. --> Make enough induction medium in 2 L flasks and autoclave it the day before! Also: Make 50  mL flasks with induction medium (autoclaved) for pre-cultures.
PAL: Tyr as substrate, details for enzyme assay still have to be determined. Detection of product @ 313 nm.
4CL: Substrate have been ordered - ask Irmi if they have arrived. Add strep-tag --> purification and in vitro assay possible.
CHS: No way to buy/produce 4-Coumaryl-CoA --> only detection by western blot.
Milestone for next week: Quickchanges and sequencing done. Western blot for expression time profile done.
Limonene
Milestone from last week: Ligation + Transformation
Still problems with cloning --> Colony-PCR for screening of clones
2 positive clones (one of each limonene synthase, citrus w/o consensus sequence, lavendula w/o N-End modification but with consensus sequence = 2 out of 5 possible genes) in pSB1C3 have been found --> Subcloning in pYES2 will be easier this way
For presentation @ Amsterdam: Present findings: different organisms, N-End rule, consensus sequnece --> Quantitative expression data would be great - Comparison of different genes with resulting enzyme activity.
Waiting for sequencing results
If you still have problems: Ask Roman about pGMT
Milestone for next week: Cloning complete & Transformation in yeast
Caffeine
Milestone from last week: Cloning
Ligations done
Transformation done
Analytical digest showed that cloning was sucessful (All genes now in pSB1C3 and pYES2)
Milestone for next week:
Sequencing, transformation in yeast
Small scale expression and detection of enzymes by western blots (until August 28th).
Also: Start 2 L batch (pre-culture needed!) and collect and freeze cell pellets to have enough enzymes for assays.
Also: Start cloning of construct "Promoter 1 - gene 1 - terminator 1 - p2 - g2- t2 - p3 - g3 - t3" --> For expression of whole pathway in one yeast strain.
Light Switchable Promoter
Milestone from last week: continue (2 more weeks)
1 fusion construct (Gal-AD with Pif3) complete (already in yeast expression vector pGADT7), the other one is still being cloned
new milestone = old milestone ;-)
Constitutive Promoters
Milestone from last week: continue (cloning in pSB1C3/pYES2) + sequencing
Promotors ADH1 und TEF1 in pSB1C3 (sequencing pending)
Problems with TEF2 terminator
Terminators: ADH1 and TEF1 in pSB1C3 (sequencing pending)
Problems with cyc1 terminator
Problems with deletion of Gal1 promotor from pYES2
Milestone for next week:
Sequencing of finished constructs
Solve problems (esp. w/ pYES2).
Characterization via limonene and thaumatin desired by Skerra
Maybe do characterization with GFP ("quick and dirty")
Thaumatin
Milestone from last week: Transformation in Yeast completed
Problem: XbaI and SpeI chosen for cloning
Status now: Cut vectors have been dephosphorylated (using SAP, fast-AP is better!)
low yield in gel extraction
ligation has been done
trafo in E. coli complete,
Next step: analytical digest & sequencing, transform in yeast (if analyt. gel ok), expression of Thaumatin
Milestone for next week:
Expression of Thaumatin (first detection via SDS-Page of supernatant (and also of cell lysate),
If positive: buy antibody - try to get it sponsored,
BUT: shipping time! - talk to David, also detectable by flavour :)
EtOH-Promoter
Quickchange & PCR
Talk w/ Ingmar
Martin can help

Gene Sequencing
(David/Roman)
Sponsored by Eurofins
2,50 Eur per Read (800 - 900 bp)
30 free reads already used
New barcodes have been bought (inform Jeff if we are running out of barcodes)
Ask Roman and Jeff about details (where to find sequence results, how to prepare samples to send them off to sequencing)
Progress Wiki
(Fabian)
each team must check and improve the texts on the official wiki concerning their projects - start early with this, it will have to be done anyway.
common structure:
1 paragraph as introduction
well-sturcutred overview
contents should be no longer than 3 or 4 pages (judges won't read overly long texts)
include links to experimental data to prove statements.
Wiki design will be inspired by oettinger website
Good photos of beer for background needed - buy it from a photo agency / stock photo page (20 or 30 Euros should be within our budget) or take them ourselves?
Interview with Prof. Hofmann
(Nadine)
questions complete? Date ?
no response - still waiting for a contact person
Ingmar and Volker will walk over there and take care of this
Progress: Genome Integration =

We have neomycin
buy SbfI from fermentas
Amsterdam
Trip is fully organised for those of us who stay from Thursday till Monday - What about the others?
Roman, Nadine and Katrin will come later - either by night train (arrival in Amsterdam around 9 am) or by rental car (cheaper, more reliable, earlier arrival in Amsterdam - method of choice). Departure will be on Friday around 6 pm. Roman can drive over night (8 hours)
Roman, Andrea will leave earlier on monday
Discussion about 30 days rule:
General conflict between achievement of goals of team and personal interests.
Skerra will make final decision who will go to Amsterdam and who won't.
Should'nt Doreen & co. come with us? At least we should invite her, because i think Doreen has really helped us until now and i have told them of Amsterdam and the US final before "recruiting" them for our team (Roman)
Do we have enough money to invite them?
On the one hand they always answered questions if we asked them, but they did not contribute directly or without being asked first
Many members of Skerra group contributed more than they did.
Idea: Offer them to pay attendance fee but ask them to make sure that the Schwab-LS will pay their travel expenses
Brewing process of our Yeast
(Martin)
Latest news from David Herrman: He never wrote explicitly if he will do the brewing for us. Now he claims that he never offered to brew for us - at this point we don't have a way to brew.
Possible solutions:
"brew" in a 2 L flask or in a fermenter - no real beer
Ask "Braufässchen" if they can help us out - Mary has personal contact to them but is on vacation until September 2nd or 3rd - who will contact them? - Jara
Ask "AWW"

iGEM @ Oktoberfest – save one date? 26th of september, after wiki freeze???
Wednesday September 19th
Missing: Andrea, Roman, Jeff (sleeping ;-), Dennis, Georg (working)
Present: Nadine, David, Alois, Fabi, Martin, Katrin, Lara, Jara, Saskia, Daniela, Mary, Volker, Ingmar, Simon
Keeping in Mind: Sending BioBricks on 24th of September! -> are all cassettes/plasmids ready until then?
Options / Formats for sending BioBricks (Simon): WE chose to send our parts in liquid form (tubes) --> 10 µl of miniprep product per BioBrick
We will send the first batch on Friday --> make sure all parts are ready for take-off.
Entering parts in Registry
Is the excel-list complete? --> will talk to ppl individually
=== What is/are our favorite BioBrick(s) ===?
Limonene-Synthase (CDS, not generator)
new pYES2
Parts of red-light promoter: PCB extraction, molecular modeling, fusion proteins, --> awesome
Caffeine expression cassette (all 3 enzymes in 1 composite part)
New version of pYES2:
Good new name for it? We chose pTUM100 --> and label the versions with different promoters "101", "102" ...
BBa_J04450 (mRFP-generator), because this is the standard insert for plasmid backbones
We will send the plasmids without the RFP-generator, but submit the version with the new RFC25 compatible RFP-generator later.
Simon (& Volker?) will enter the BioBricks in the registry. Make sure to provide all the necessary information, especially the experimental data & results documenting the parts' characterization
Judging form - will be filled out Tuesday evening
which of our parts are characterized well?
which of our new parts work as expected?
Did we improve a previously existing bioBrick? Did we help other teams (collaboration)? Are all our Human Practice efforts documented?
Lab Report + New milestones (all)
Volker wrote a timetable on the whiteboard: Which experiments will be done when? --> Photograph!
Thaumatin
Milestone from last week: Comassie Gel, Integration starting?
No band for Thaumatin visible on SDS-PAGE
To Do / Next Steps: IEC (Ion Exchange Chromatography), New gels with new cell lysates (bigger batch), mass spectrometry of protein
Limonene
Milestone from last week: Assays @ Schwab?
Limonene (produced in vitro by citrus limonen synthetase) could be detected in GC-MS, Smell test was performed (different cultures of yeast smell differently!)
To Do / Next Steps: Take culture supernatant for GC-MS (--> in vivo experiment), new versions of smell tests, toxicity tests, luciferase assay to detect the pyrophosphate which is formed during the reaction, purify a larger amount of enzyme, compare expression of limonene synthase with and without consensus sequence (--> cell lysate --> western blot) , mass spectrometry of protein
Biobricks: With and without consensus sequence, different promoters/terminators
Caffeine
Milestone from last week: large scale expression of all three enzymes, All three cassettes finished
Three 1 L batches (1 per enzyme) are currently being done --> expression of each enzymes
Big expression cassette (all 3 enzymes) not finished, all other parts are done.
To Do / Next steps: Harvest cells/enzymes, purify/isolate enzymes, perform enzyme assays, detect caffeine @ prof. Hoffman, mass spectrometry of proteins
Coumaryl
Name will be changed to xanthohumol. Emphasize the fact that other products (such as resveratrol) can be produced if the first 2 enzymes of our pathway are combined with other parts from the registry
Milestone from last week: New Cloning + Western Blot
New cloning steps are finished, all mutations are removed (all except PAL, which still carries some mutations), BioBricks are complete.
The mutations of PAL can be explained: probably due to a natural occuring difference between the organism from which our sequence is derived and the organism which was used for the generation of the genome sequence.
All 5 enzymes/plasmids have been transformed into yeast
To Do / Next Steps: Express enzymes, perform SDS-PAGEs and western-blots. Be careful during critical steps of expression / isolation of enzymes! Enzyme assays for PAL and 4CL: photometric detection of concentration changes of tyrosine / 4-coumarate can be used to characterize these enzymes. If westernblots are successful: Perform cell lysis, pool enzymes and make in vitro experiment, have Prof. Hoffman analyse/detect Xanthohumol on monday (LC-MS).
Light switchable promoter
Milestone from last week: finished Cloning + start expression
Jeff is sleeping - finally :-)
All BiobBicks will be finished, despite all the problems (large BioBricks!)
Parts will be transformed in yeast
Constitutive promoters
Milestone from last week: begin with characterization of the promoters using thaumatin and GFP?
TEF2-luciferase ligation/transformation did not work. TEF1 promoter is being used by several other groups.
Characterization of TEF1, ADH1 promoters: Promoter-Luciferase-constructs have been transformed in yeast.
Terminators are finished
Genome integration and brewing
Integration transformation worked well. Integrated constructs: mOrange, G418 resistance
Now: Culture cells for a number of generations without selective pressure and then analyse how viable they are under selective conditions afterwards --> if they are still resistant, the casette has been integrated successfully. Generate additional data (not only the resistance has been integrated, but is the expression casette also functional?): Measure mOrange fluorescence.
Integration of Limonene: Integration vector is almost finished --> miniprep tomorrow. Integration of Limonene-Synthase can be finished by Sunday/Monday.
Integration of Thaumatin: Has already been done, we have colonies, but results are ambiguous. Will be repeated?
EtOH-Promoter
new experiments --> after Amsterdam
Time table: who is available during the last week before wiki freeze?
--> Excel-sheet in dropbox
Logo (Volker)
beer labels: must be improved, maybe have a connecting theme (fond?) with our other logo. Use TUM-Logo instead of written TUM on bottles --> Volker will do it. Jara has the vector graphics. Votes: 9 pro, 3 contra, 1 abstain
Wiki: what is to do until freeze?
Data page!!! cf. https://igem.org/Sample_Data_Page
Missing texts
Brewing
Integration
Vector design
Standard for references: Fabi will make sure it is correct.
Movie for Amsterdam (Matze) do we want a movie?
We want a movie, but the concept/script/idea needs to be improved.
Good idea by Volker: 45 Seconds commercial, 3 scenes: 1.: Oktoberfest, short message: "Beer is awesome", 2.: "Explanation of our project in 30 seconds", 3.: "Sitting in "Biergarten" and enjoying the even better new Syn-Bio beer" (close-up of our bottles). For Explanation/Scene2: Have requisites which represent all ingredients: lime, coffee beans, sugar, hops
Will be done saturday.
Diplomarbeit of Jessica Ebner
-> how do we use it in wiki?
Results of SWOT-analysis not very useful for us?
Nadine will write a few paragraphs about this collaboration in the wiki.
Monday September 24th
Present: Martin, Dennis, Nadine, Volker, Simon, Katrin, Andrea, Volker, Ingmar, Mary
Report on Results
Thaumatin
IEX - we could detect via SDS it in the cell lysis, not in supernatant expression was not sufficient for ms, export is not sufficient --> what concentration is necessary to be able to taste it?
Limonene
in vivo detection via headspace + GCMS - with consensus sequence was better in vitro detection was successful analtical gel filtration was performed larger assay will be done for higher peak. Pyrosequencing will be done tomorrow - + substrate dependence + temperature dependence + enzyme dependence detection in brewed beer via gcms
Caffeine
Ingmar was @ Hoffmann, unfortunately large scale expression did not work, maybe repeat this? detection via lcms of caffeine @ Hoffmann 8th biobrick was finished and sent out -> make another transformation with this for our presentation.
Xanthohumol
Expression was not successful :(
Integration
None of the colonies have grown yet :( --> integration of several bricks into one yeast -> another integration vector + cre recombinase brick for g418 resistance is available.
Light Switchable
Characterization is probably not possible in time we should stop cloning here and focus on work in the wiki!
What has to be done in the wiki?
