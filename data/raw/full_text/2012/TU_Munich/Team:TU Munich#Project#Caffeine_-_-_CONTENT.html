However, it remains to be elucidated whether the nucleosidase reaction is catalyzed by an unspecific purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) or by the first N-methyl transferase of the reaction cascade shown in the picture (Fig. 1). Being involved in the catabolism of all purine nucleosides, PNP is an essential enzyme for organisms and was shown to catalyze the removal of the ribose moiety of 7-methylxanthine in <I>in vitro</I> caffeine biosynthesis [<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12746542" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Uefuji et al., 2003</A>]. The <I>in vivo</I> synthesis of caffeine has also been shown by expression of the three N-methyl transferases in tobacco plants. Therefore, the assumption that the first methyl transferase is <B>bifunctional and catalyzes the nucleosidase reaction</B> is favored [<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18068204" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Ashihara et al., 2008</A>], [<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1914188/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">McCarthy and McCarthy, 2007</A>]. The presence of PNP or equal enzymes in plants has not yet been proven and a catalytic mechanism of the nucleosidase reaction is rather thinkable and has been explained by [<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1914188/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">McCarthy and McCarthy, 2007</A>].  As a matter of fact, a single N-methyl nucleosidase, as it is shown on the depicted pathway below, has indeed been partially purified out of tea leaves [<A href="http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110006323439/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Negishi et al. (1988)</A>], but neither the native enzyme nor its DNA have ever been isolated [<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18068204" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Ashihara et al., 2008</A>].
</P>
The enzyme caffeine synthase (last reaction step) can catalyze both the conversion of 7-methyl xanthine to theobromine and the methylation of theobromine to caffeine. Unfortunately, the affinity of this enzyme to 7-methyl xanthosine is less than one sixth of that of the other isoform CaMXMT1 [<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12746542" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Uefuji et al., 2003</A>]. To obtain the best results, we decided to express both enzymes. One can also see the K<SUB>m</SUB> values for the required enzymes in this paper - it shows that the substrate affinity decreases continuously towards the endpoint (caffeine), &quot;making the reaction proceed irreversibly and stepwise&quot; [<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12746542" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Uefuji et al., 2003</A>]. <DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:482px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Fig. 1: Xanthosine providing metabolic pathways</B></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>
The chemical compound xanthosine is produced via <B>at least four different routes</B>, shown in the picture &quot;xanthosine routes&quot;. To improve caffeine production, these pathways could be a <B>possible target for metabolic engineering in the future</B>.
</P><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:902px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Fig. 2: Pathway for <I>in vivo</I> caffeine biosynthesis in <I>coffea arabica</I></B></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>During the degradation of caffeine, it is demethylated to theophylline by 7N-demethylase (main pathway). The decreased rate of this reaction is the <B>reason for the accumulation of caffeine in the plant.</B> Afterwards, theophylline is degraded to xanthine via 3-methylxanthine and xanthine enters the conventional purine catabolism pathway (degradation to CO<SUB>2</SUB> and NH<SUB>3</SUB>) [<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18068204" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Ashihara et al., 2008</A>]. This catabolistic pathway is <B>another possible target</B> for metabolic engineering to increase the amount of caffeine.

Its chemical structure is similar to that of the ribonucleoside adenosine. Hence, it can <B>block specific receptors in the hypothalamus</B>. Adenosine binding leads to decreased neurotransmitter release and therefore decreased neuron activity. This induces sleep and thus avoids overexertion of the brain. Since caffeine <B>antagonizes adenosine and increases neuronal activity</B>, it is used as a means to stay awake. On average, one cup (150 ml) of coffee contains about 50 - 130 mg caffeine and one cup of tea about 25 - 90 mg. At higher doses (1 g), caffeine leads to higher pulse rates and hyperactivity, but until that, the alcohol will already have done its work...
</P><P>Moreover, caffeine was shown to decrease the growth of <I>E. Coli</I> and yeast reversibly as of a concentration of 0.1 % by acting as a mutagen (Putrament et al., On the Specificity of Caffeine Effects, MGG, 1972), but previous caffeine synthesis experiments (see below) have only led to a concentration of about 5 µg/g (per g fresh weight of tobacco leaves). Therefore, we do not expect to reach critical concentrations and the amounts of caffeine in coffee or tea (leading to physiological effects) is usually a little bit lower.

</LI><LI> the <B>yeast consensus sequence</B> for improved ribosome binding (TACACA) was added 5' of the start codon ATG 
</LI><LI> according to the <B>N- end rule</B> and the yeast consensus sequence for improved ribosome binding, the first triplet after ATG (GAG) was exchanged with TCT (serine) to optimize protein stability and mRNA translation. This decision was made after analysis of the 3D- structure of the enzyme CaDXMT1. Because the first two residues of the amino acid sequence are not shown in the crystallized structure (probably because of high flexibility) we chose to exchange this amino acid. Further study (uniprot entry) showed that the first two residues of the sequence are not immediately involved in ligand binding in one of the three enzymes. Due to high similarity of the sequences of the three enzymes, we also changed this amino acid in the enzymes CaXMT1 and CaMXMT1.
</LI><LI> we added a <B>C- terminal <I>Strep</I>-tag</B> for purification and detection

</LI><LI> we exchanged all critical restriction sites (RFC10 and RFC25)
</LI></UL><P>All mentioned methyltransferases use SAM as methyl donor and are located in the cytoplasm of the plants. Furthermore, they exist as homodimers, being also able to form heterodimers with each other (see <A href="http://www.brenda-enzymes.info" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Brenda</A>, also for further characteristics). The temperature- and pH-optima of all three enzymes are quite similar (between 20°C - 37°C and 7,5 - 8,5). The pH-optimum is compatible with the slightly acidic environment during beer brewing.

The BioBricks BBa_K801073, BBa_K801074 and BBa_K801075 are enzyme generators, which provide continuous expression of the particular enzymes and are all part of the final <B>caffeine synthesis pathway</B> composite part. The choice for the respective promoters was made to support the irreversible production of caffeine, as it is <I>in vivo</I> in coffee plants, being assured by continuously increasing K<SUB>m</SUB> values of the three enzymes (H. Sano et al., 2003). Besides, we focused on prohibiting metabolic stress reactions. Thus, we used the <I>Tef2</I> promoter for the first enzyme CaXMT1 and the stronger <I>Tef1</I> promoter for the next enzyme, which is CaMXMT1, to establish high concentrations of the caffeine precursor theobromine. As soon as a certain amount of theobromine is available, the caffeine synthesis can go on. The last enzyme CaDXMT1 is then again regulated by the <I>Tef2</I> promoter.

</P><P>We have been successful in the expression of the three single enzymes making up the caffeine biosynthesis metabolic pathway. Therefore, we used this composite part BBa_K801077 for expression of the enzymes, followed by <B>enzymatic analyses</B>, in order to prove the functionality of our enzymes. After having cloned it into our vector <B>pTUM100</B>, we performed an enzyme assay as described in [<A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12746542" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Uefuji et al., 2003</A>], with the enzymes having been harvested after 20 hours. The reaction conditions were 27 °C at a pH of 8.0.
</P><P>Detection of single metabolites of the caffeine biosynthesis pathway was <B>performed by LC/MS analysis</B>, using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The picture below shows that we <B>were in fact able</B> to perform an <I>in vitro</I> synthesis of theobromine, which is the <B>immediate precursor of caffeine</B>. However, the detection of caffeine was quite difficult, because the negative control also showed the corresponding signal with an identical retention time and it is hard to say if caffeine has really been produced by our expression cassette. We assumed, that a possible reason for the failed detection could be the fact, that the concentration of available theobromine in the reaction mixture was too less. Thus, we started another experiment, in which we added theobromine directly to the isolated crude extract. However, it turned out that the used theobromine was too impure and already contained caffeine, which made it hard to draw any reliable conclusions.

The used yeast strains were the laboratory strain INVSc1, a strain which is used for brewing beer and a strain which can be purchased in a supermarket. Caffeine was added to the YPD medium in concentrations from 1 µM up to 100 mM and the growth rate was measured after a defined period of time. 
</P><P>We confirmed the toxic effect of caffeine on yeast at the concentration of 100 mM and the growth inhibition at the concentration of 10 mM.  Furthermore we showed the correlation between decreasing caffeine concentration and growth rate. Cells incubated with caffeine concentrations in the range of micro molar showed a similar growth rate than the negative control (incubation without caffeine).
