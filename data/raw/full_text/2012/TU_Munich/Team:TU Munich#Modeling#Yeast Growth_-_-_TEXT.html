Yeast Growth Model
Model Selection
As none of our measurement for yeast growth included the stationary phase, fitting a Gompertz curve,
would most likely result in unidentifiabilities as the model is too complex. As the data was normalized to the value at t=0, we fitted it an non-scaled exponential curve.
This means that only one parameter remains, the inverse doubling time, scaled by a factor of ln(2). The normalization ensures that values between measurements are comparable.
Code
data1=[1,1.3625,2.875,5.25];  t=[0,80,270,450];  fun = @(k,data) sum(((exp(k(1)*t)-data)/k(2)).^2);  [k, RN] = fminsearch(@(k) fun(k,data1) - length(t)*log(1/(sqrt(2*pi*k(2)))),[0.005 1]);  kc=0.01; acc=0; nacc=0; n=10000; sample=zeros(n,1); prob=zeros(n,1); lh=zeros(n,1); accepted=zeros(n,1);  kprev = k(1); s=1; while (s<n+1)     if(mod(s,500)==0)         (s)/n;         display(['Acceptance Rate: ' num2str(acc/(nacc+acc)*100) '%'])     end     try  % the step is sampled from a multivariate normal distribution and  % scaled with kc     kcur = kprev + kc*mvnrnd(0,0.001);     sample(s,:) = kcur;  % calculate the a-posteriori probability of the new sample     prob(s) = -fun([kcur k(2)],data1);     if s>1  % check whether we reject the sample or not. mind that the  % probability is log-scaled         if log(rand(1)) < +prob(s)-prob(s-1)  % update current sample             kprev = kcur;  % count accepted samples             acc=acc+1;  % save current acceptance rate for post-processing             lh(s)=acc/(nacc+acc)*100;             s=s+1;         else  % count not accepted samples             nacc=nacc+1;         end     else  % we need to do something else for the first sample.         if log(rand(1)) < prob(s)+RN             kprev = kcur;             acc=acc+1;  %waitbar((k-1)/n)             lh(s)=acc/(nacc+acc)*100;             s=s+1;         else             nacc=nacc+1;         end       end     catch ME         disp(ME)     end end disp(['Doubling Time: ' num2str(mean(log(2)./sample)) ' STD: ' num2str(std(log(2)./sample))])
