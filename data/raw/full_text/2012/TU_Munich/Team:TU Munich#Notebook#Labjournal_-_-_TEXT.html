BUT: error was performed during preparing the digested plasmid DNA for analytical gelelectrophoresis in the dilution step. 1:10 dilution of analyctical probe with DNA loading buffer:
3.3 µL sample (contains already 1x loading buffer!)
0.7 µL loading buffer (?x)
6 µL TAE-buffer
Should have done: 3 µL sample + 1 µL loading buffer (10x) + 6 µL TAE-buffer (1x)
DNA-ladder preperation: 10 µL ladder stock solution + 10 µL DNA loading buffer + 80 µL TAE-buffer. 10 µL of this solution was pipetted in one gel pocket of the prepared 1% agarose gel including ehtiudiumbromid.
20 µL of each samples were also pipetted into the gel pockets.
The gel pockets were pipetted after following scheme:
Heme oxygenase (colony 1)
Heme oxygenase (colony 2)

Quick Change mutagenesis to insert Ala in front of the Strep-tag II in pTUM104_RFC25 MCS
Investigator: Ingmar
Aim of the experiment: Generation of an RFC 25 compatible version of the pTUM104 Vector.
As the sequencing of the first attempt to introduce Ala in front of the Strep-tag II did not show a successfull insertion of Ala, the quickchange mutagense was performed once again with a modified setup. Presumably a formation of primer dimers was responsable for the experiment's results. Therefore the second PCR was operated in two steps as shown below.

Phycocyanobilin (PCB) extraction from dried Spirulina platensis powder (part 1/4)
Investigator: Jeff, Alois, Martin
Aim of the experiment: Phycocyanobilin (PCB) is a cofactor neeeded for the funtion of phytochrome B. Phycocyanobilin is covalently bound to Cys457 of phytochrome B. Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not contain endogenous PCB. For proof of concept PCB should be added to the medium. In the following experiment, PCB is extracted from dried Spirulina platensis powder.
Operational sequence:
50 g of Spirulina platensis powder was (from concept-vitalprodukte.de) resuspended in 1.5 l of H2O (30 mg/l) in a beaker covered with aluminium foil.
Stirring for 10 min at RT.
Green Spirulina suspension was divided in 6 centrifuge bottles, covered in aluminium foil.
Centrifation at 10500 rpm at 4 °C (SLA-3000 rotor, Thermo Scientific) for 1 h.
Supernatant was discarded
25 ml of MeOH added to each bottle and was heavily shaked to resuspend the pellet for the next cleaning step with MeOH.
Each bottle with the resuspended pellet were filled with MeOH to a final volume of 250 ml and shaked again to fully resuspend the pellet.
Centrifugation at 10500 rpm at 4 °C (SLA-3000 rotor, Thermo Scientific) for 10 min.
Supernatant was discarded.
The last 4 steps were repeated until the supernatant of the washed pellet was colorless or cyanblue but not green anymore (Regulary, it takes 3 or 4 times). Pellet should be cyanblue now.
The pellet of the 6 centrifuge tubes was collected in a sole centrifugation tube, covered in aluminium foil tube, by scratching it out with a small spoon.
The remaining rest of the pellet which cannot be scratched out were resuspended in a small amount of MeOH and were transformed from tube to tube with a interim shaking step.
This suspension was transferred into the tube with the scratched-out pellet.
Centrifugation at 10500 rpm at 4 °C (SLA-3000 rotor, Thermo Scientific) for 10 min.
Supernatant was discarded.
Finally washed pellet was stored, wrapped in foil overnight for the methanolysis next day.

Phycocyanobilin (PCB) extraction from dried Spirulina platensis powder (part 4/4)
Investigator: Martin, Jeff, Alois
Aim of the experiment: Phycocyanobilin (PCB) is a cofactor neeeded for the funtion of phytochrome B. Phycocyanobilin is covalently bound to Cys457 of phytochrome B. Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not contain endogenous PCB. For proof of concept PCB should be added to the medium. In the following experiment, PCB is extracted from dried Spirulina platensis powder.
Operational sequence:
The supernatants (~1l in total) of the two previous experiments were pooled and put into a rotary evaporater in order to acquire a concentrate of approximately 100ml.
The settings of the rotary evaporater: ~160 millibars, waterbath temperature of 25-30°C
Furthermore, there were measures to be taken to protect the solution from direct sunlight: blinds down, aluminum foil wrapped around the waterbath
Afterwards we transfered the Methanol solution into a separating funnel and added another 100ml of aqua dest..
By means of adding chloroform we created two phases. The lower (chloroform) phase with the solved Phycocyanobilin was separated and put into another rotary evaporater flask. This step was repeated three times in order to get all the Phycocanobilin into the next step
Then the chloroform was completely removed in the rotary evaporater (same settings as before), the pure (?) Phycocyanobilin in the flask was solved in 60 ml DMSO, transfered into a new flask and frozen at -20 °C.

After 12h of cultivating the S. cerevisiae is growing quite well. There is a tendency that the brewing yeast strain 34/70 is not capable to grow sufficiently in autoclaved (e.g. proteinfree) medium. Since the 34/70 was stored at 4°C over 5 days, directly used to inoculate the medium (no preparatory culture) and we only used 1ml to inoculate with (compared to 5ml of the preparatory culture of S. cerevisiae - because of obvious differences in opacity of the inoculation media) there is not yet a conclusion to be drawn. We decided to incubate for another 24h at least.

It seems as if the ligation was successful. However it is strange that the band of OMT is lower that the one of CHS.  we had the wrong information about the length of OMT -> the right length of OMT is 1059 bp, so everything is fine :)

After 40h of cultivating the S. cerevisiae is growing comparably to the brewing yeast strain, though we seem to have entered a phase of substrate limitation. Autoclaved media lack solved protein and is thus for neither of the yeasts a satisfying medium; added hop also represses their growth (S. cerevisiae shows a higher susceptability - which seems logic, since the brewing yeast is selected to survive and prosper in beer brewing environment).
The next step would be to brew with our "laboratory strain" S. cerevisiae.

Aim of the experiment: Execute the Western Blot using the StrepMab Classic antibody in order to test whether the immunospecifity is better. Furthermore one of the first SDS-PAGEs was done with an increased protein concentration.
Operational sequence
To test wheather the increased protein concentrations lead to overloaded bonds, two SDS-PAGE gels which have been stained with Coomassie brilliant blue afterwards were run parallely to the ones for the Western blots.
The preparation of the samples was executed as describes on August, 8th.
12 % SDS-PAGE gel, width of the collection gel: 2 mmm
6 µl Unstained Protein MW Marker (Thermo Scientific) for the staining with Coomassie brilliant blue and 6 µl Prestained Protein MW Marker (Thermo Scientific)for the western blots.
15 µl sample
SDS gel with 30 µg protein of each sample:
Mass of enzymes:
PAL = 76.880 kDa
4CL = 61.053 kDa
CHS = 42.713 kDa

Analysis of plated, untransformed chemocompetent E.Coli- cells
Investigator: Roman
Aim: To test the prepared chemocompetent E.Coli- cells.
Results:
Plate with kanamycin: no colonys (as expected)
Plate with ampicillin: no colonys (as expected)
Plate with tetracyclin: full (as expected, due to natural resistance)
Plate with chloramphenicol: 12 colonies (not expected, should be empty)
The plating on a chloramphenicol containing plate will be repeated, at 37°C over night instead of room temperature over the weekend, because perhaps chloramphenicol is degraded by the bacteria after two days
Small-Scale Yeast Transformation of pTUM104 without insert
Investigator: Katrin, Ingmar
Aim of the experiment:Transformation of P152 (pTUM104 without insert) in Yeast
The protocol on page 13 of the pYES2 manual was used. To ensure a positive result, two transformations were made.
Only modifications are noted:
step 1: inoculate in 4 ml YPD medium
step 2: OD600 = 5,6 -> to determine a OD600 of 0.4 in 50 ml, 3 ml yeast suspension and 50 ml YPD medium were used.
steps 3 and 4: centrifugation for 5 min, 4 °C
step 6:
1 µg plasmid DNA
P152: c = 156.8 ng/µl -> 6,4 µl
100 µg denatured sheared salmon sperm: the one from Simon was used -> 10 µl
The cells were plated out on SC-U plates with Glucose and incubated at 30°C
Plasmid isolation of p123 and p136
Investigator: Roman
Aim: Aim of the experiment was the isolation of p123 out of transformed (see friday) XL-1 blue chemo competent e.coli- cells. Old and newly prepared competent cells were used (see friday). Besides, p136 was isolated out of transformed cells, which is pSB1C3 with CHS- inserted. The whole experiment should provide an adequate amount of pSB1C3 backbone for the caffeine team, because we want to insert our three genes in this vector.
Operational Sequence:
The plasmid preparation was performed as described in the manufacturers protocoll (Quiagen Miniprep Kit). Elution was done with 50 µl Elution Buffer in one step. Due to the incubation of the liquid cultures at room temperature over the weekend instead of 37°C over night, the pellet was a bit smaller than usual, resulting in concentrations of only:
51,9 ng/µl (p123, old competent cells used)
57,8 ng/µl (p123, new competent cells used)
59,2 ng/µl (p136)

Dilution of gen- synthesis products and transformation
Investigator: Roman
Aim:
Dilution of dried pUCIDT- Amp vector, which contains the gene synthesis products. Afterwards, transformation of pUCIDT_CaXMT1, pUCIDT_CaMXMT1 and pUCIDT_CaDXMT1 in chemo competent XL-1 blue e.coli- cells, to make the genes available for cloning in pSB1C3 and pTUM104
Operational sequence
Basical vector data of pUCIDT
length: 2752 bp
resistance: ampicillin
About 2 µg of dried vector (containing our inserts) were delivered. By dilution with 20 µl bidestillated water (after centrifugation), a final concentration of about 100 ng/µl was adjusted.
Transformation
Transformation in chemo competent cells was performed as previously described. Unconcentrated plating (100 µl) was performed on ampicillin containing LB agar plates, whereas the rest of the transformation- batch was stored in the fridge at 4°C (previous experiments showed, that unconcentrated plating led to enough colonies). The plates were incubated at room temperature over the next two days.
Repetition of plating of newly prepared chemo competent cells
Investigator: Roman
Aim:
Test of newly prepared chemo competet cells, due to present chloramphenicol resistance
Operational sequence
Because 12 colonies were grown on chloramphenicol containing agar plates after incubation at room temperature over the weekend (although "empty" competent XL1- blue cells were used), this plating was repeated and incubation was carried out at 37°C over night.

Picking from the overnight transformation of ligated P71+P322, P71+P323, P206+P337 and P342+PCR66 product in E. coli XL1-Blue
Investigator: Jeff
Aim of the experiment: Picking from the overnight transformation of ligated P71+P322, P71+P323, P206+P337 and P342+PCR66 product in E. coli XL1-Blue.
Procedure:
5 colonies of each transformation from P71+P322 (AmpR), P71+P323 (AmpR), P206+P337 (CamR) and P342+PCR66 (AmpR) transformated cells were picked.
Colonies were picked with pipette tips and transferred into a new cell-culture tube with 4 ml of LB-medium and antibiotics (P71+P322 (AmpR), P71+P323 (AmpR), P206+P337 (CamR) and P342+PCR66 (AmpR)). These tubes were put overnight in a 180 rpm cell culture shaker at 37 °C.
Reapeat of transformation of E. coli XL1-Blue with ligation products of P71+P322, P71+P323, P206+P337 and P342+PCR66 from August, the 13th
Investigator: Jeff
Aim of the experiment: Reapeat of transformation of E. coli XL1-Blue with ligation products of P71+P322, P71+P323, P206+P337 and P342+PCR66 from August, the 13th. The reason is that the freshly prepared competent cells are contaminated with a foreign plasmid.
Procedure:
5 µl of the ligation products (P71+P322, P71+P323, P206+P337 and P342+PCR66) and their negative controls (P206 NK, P324 NK) were added to 100 µl of CaCl2 competent E. coli XL1-Blue cells on ice.
30 min incubation on ice.

Adding of 1 ml LB-medium to each tube.
Incubation for 45 min at 37 °C in the 180 rpm cell-culture shaker.
100 µl of those cell suspension were plated on suitable antiotic plates.
The rest were centrifuged for 1 min at 13000 rpm and the supernatant was dicarded.
The pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of LB-medium and this concentrated cell suspension was plated again on suitable antbiotic plates. Accidently, only the pellet of P342+PCR66 and P342 NK was plated.
Analysis of plated XL1-blue chemo competent E.coli (untransformed)
Investigator: Volker
Aim:
Test of prepared chemo competent cells (empty) due to present resistance for chloramphenicol
Results
Again 14 colonies have grown on the plate, after incubating at 37°C over night. One can presume, that the newly prepared competent cells have taken up any plasmid providing chloramphenicol resistance (e.g. pSB1C3), makin them unuseful for our experiments. The uptake probably took place when inoculating the LB medium, one day befor the cells were prepared, because a sample of our old competent cells was used for the inoculation instead of a plated colony of e.coli- XL1-blue.

at 13:30h the overnight culture was diluted in 50 ml SC-U medium conataining 2 % galactose until an OD600 of 0.4.
beginning 4h after induction every 3 h samples were taken and cells were disrupted according to "Expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae" of Huang FC, Studart-Witkowski C & Schwab W 2010. The supernatant of the disrupted cells were used for protein concentration appreciation using the nanodrop photometer. Afterwards they were stored at -80°C.
Gel extraction of p123 and p136
Investigator: Roman
Aim:
Extraction of pSB1C3 (digested with Xba1 and Pst1, = p123 and p136; digest was made on Monday) out of agarose gel.
Operational Sequence
Gel extraction was performed as described the manufacturers protocol (Quiagen). However, the determined concentrations (NanoDrop) were quite low:
8 ng/µl for p123 (Xba/Pst1)
11 ng/µl for p136 (Xba1/Pst1)
This results in a yield of only about 20% (original concentrations were between 50 and 60 ng/µl) Thus, a new over night culture was prepared (see below) to gain a higher initial concentration of plasmid DNA. The next gel extraction will be performed with bidestillated water (instead of elution buffer EB), temperated at 50°C.

Investigator: Roman
Aim:
Extraction of Xba1 and Pst1 digested pTUM104 out of agarose gel, to make it ready for ligation
Operational sequence:
Gel extraction was performed as described in the manufacturers protocoll. However, bidestillated water was used for elution (30µl). Besides, the water was heated up to 37°C and also the 5 minutes of incubation (before final centrifugation) was done on the heating block at 37°C.
NanoDrop
Concentration of the extracted plasmid was determined with NanoDrop and resulted in a concentration of 75,9 ng/µl. As of now, all elution steps in gel extraction procedures will be performed at these conditions.

Picking Clones for Ingmar and Roman
Investigator: Volker
4 Clones for each plate were picked in apropiate media at 1.40 AM => please do not prep before 12 AM!
Eight of them are in the 30° incubator on the right side. If you read this at the right time please put them into the 37°C incubator if there is not some space and prep them in the second round. Thanks!
From Ingmas plates p187, p196 and p193 no clones could be picked because there were no single colonies
on all positive plates there was a sufficient number of clones (50-300)
Romans negative controle plates had no (Bneg) and 6 (Yneg) clones which is good / acceptable
on all positive plates there was a sufficient number of clons (30-200)

Aim: Ligate the extracted plasmids of the experiment before
Due to the small yield we only were able to run 4 ligations:
1: pSB1C3 and P343   I: pSB1C3 and P343 OVER NIGHT at 16 °C   4: pYes and P343  IV: pYes and P344 OVER NIGHT at 16 °C
1 and 4 were directly transformed in E. Coli - to be picked the next day.
Transformation of over-weekend ligation of caffeine synthesis genes in pSB1C3 and pTUM104
Investigator: Saskia
Aim: Transformation of the ligation
Operational Sequence
The transformation procedure was carried out as previously described, whereas the entire ligation batch was used for transformation in XL1 blue chemo competent e.coli-cells. The 30 minutes on ice incubation was followed by the heat shock at 37°C for 5 minutes and an incubation at 180 rpm at 37°C for about 45 minutes. Afterwords, the suspension was plated on appropriate plates (pSB1C3 transformants with chloramphenicol, pTUM104 transformants with ampicillin) and incubated at 37°C over night. Besides, the pellet was also plated out (resuspension in about ca. 100 µl LB medium).
Note: This transformation was performed without knowing, that a transformation with 5 µl of every ligation batch was already done on saturday. Furthermore, clone picking and preparing of over night liquid cultures was made, too (on sunday).

Small scale yeast transformation with pTUM104_CaXMT1, pTUM104_CaMXMT1 and pTUM104_CaDXMT1
Investigator: Saskia, Roman
Aim: To transform our yeast strain saccharomyces cerevisiae INVSC1 -URA with the created pTUM104 plasmids, to be able to start expression of our genes.
Operational sequence:
The transformation of the yeast cells was performed as described in the pYES2 Manual of Invitrogen (small scale  yeast transformation).
Used plasmids pTUM104_Insert were previously isolated out of clones: Y1B, Y2D, Y3A
As positive control, we used a pTUM104_eGFP plasmid (provided by Simon) and as negative control, no plasmid (water) was "transformed".
1xTE and 1xLiAc/40%PEG-3350/1xTE solution were created immediately before use and sterilized by steril- filtration. The other solutions had already been available (and had also been sterilized by steril- filtration).
The resuspended pellets were plated on adequate selective SC -URA plates (minimal, defined medium for yeast, without uracil, due to selection for pTUM104 vector).
Plates were incubated at 30°C over night
Preparation of SC Minimal Medium
Investigator: Saskia, Roman
We prepared 3 l of SC Minimal Medium as described in the pYES manual on page 10. We mixed and autoclaved 50 ml of the already prepared SC-aliquots with 850 ml ELGA and 6.7 g Yeast Nitrogen Base. Additionally we prepared a 20 % glucose and two 20 % galactose solutions. Therefore we mixed 20 g galactose or glucose with 100 ml ELGA and autoclaved it. Note that you need more induction media with galactose than SC medium with glucose. And we don't use raffinose for the induction media.

Gel picture of vectorfragmentation 1
Gel picture of vectorfragmentation 2
The fragmentation pattern does not show unexpeted bonds. Therefore the gene constructs might have some point mutations which are not visible via Agarose gel electrophoresis. As the transformation of yeast with our constructs resulted in a reasonable number of cfu, it is likely that the URA3 gene and the 2µOri are not affected by possible mutations. Thats why we will continue our work with sequencing our gene constructs including their respective promoters.

Cell lysis of 5ml samples taken 20min after expression induction
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Cell lysis of yeast cell- samples taken 20 min after expression. The idea is to compare the gene expression 20min after induction and 20h after induction. The signals on the western blott should show, that the two bands of our expressed enzymes are only visible after 20h.
Operational sequence:
an adequate amount of breaking buffer (containing PMSF) was given to the frozen cell pellet, as well as an equal amount of glass beads. Note: because the supernatant could not be taken after 10 min centrifugation, another 30µl of breaking buffer were added.
cell- walls were disrupted by vortexing for 30 sec, followed by 30 sek on ice. This procedure was repeated 4 times.
protein concentration was determined by NanoDrop (blank: breaking buffer)
CaXMT1 crude extract: 1 mg/ml

SDS- Page of protein crude extracts, taken at different times after induction of expression
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment is the preparation of a SDS- page, to make a subsequent western blot and to compare the samples, taken at different expression times.
Operational sequence:
The SDS- gel was prepared as previously described (12%). 20µg protein crude extract of each sample were loaded on the gel. Running- time: ca. 2h at 120V. Additionally to the prestained protein marker, we used an un- prestained marker, which contained a 45 kDa protein. Afterwards, the gel was immediately used for the western blot.

Sequencing of structural genes of Xanthohumol including the promoter
Investigator: Ingmar
Aim of the experiment: Check wheather the gene constructs have mutations in the promoters
Results: The following geneconstructs were sequenced including the promoter:   P194 4Cl- in pYes P263 APT in pYes P197 OMT+ in pYes P198 OMT- in pYes P200 PAL- in pYes P236 PAL+ in pYes All of these sequences did not show any mutation in the promoter. Therefore the fact that our proteins were not detectable might be a result of errors during the transformation. Hence the transformation will be repeated. Parallely our gene constructs will be cloned into a pYes vector backbone of the Limonen group who could successfully express and detect their proteins.

Staining with Ponceau's reagent and western blot analysis of protein crude extract of CaXMT1, CaMXMT1 and eGFP transformants after 20 minutes and 20 hours of expression
Investigator: Saskia, Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Detection of expressed proteins CaXMT1, CaMXMT1, eGFP.
Operational sequence:
The western blot membran (having been blocked over the night at 4°C) was washed with PBS- T0.1 four times (4x 15min).  Because of the use of un- prestained protein marker (see Thursday, 6.9.), we stained the western blot membran with Ponceau's reagent and assigned the bands, followed by washing the membran with PBS- T0.1 again (15 minutes, 2x). Afterwards, the membran was incubated for 1h with detection reagent. Detection reagent:
10ml 1xPBS
0,2% BSA (0,02g have been weighted in)
2µl anti body MABclassic
After incubating with the first antibody, the membran was washed again with PBS-T0.1 three times (3x 5min), followed by the incubation with the second antibody (anti mouse, fused with alk. phosphatase) for another our. Second detection reagent:
10ml 1xPBS
0,2% BSA (see above)
5µl AntiMouse-alk. Phosphatase conjugate (1/2000 dilution)
The development was performed after washing the membran with PBS- T0.1 for 10 min (two times) and with 1xPBS for 10 min (two times). For this, the membran was shortly washed with AP buffer and then incubated with a solution containing 15ml AP buffer, 45µl BCIP (50mg/ml in DMF) and 7,5µl NBT (75mg/ml in 70% DMF) for a few minutes, until clear bands appeared.

Conclusion for P676 (=pSB6A0 (BBa_K268000)): This part contains at least one forbidden restriction site (XbaI or PstI, please see analytical gel from September, the 6th. But here, one can see that EcoRI and SpeI can nevertheless be used for cloning parts into pSB6A0
The other parts (P73 (BBa_K207001 in pSB1A2), P81 (BBa_K207000 in pSB3K3), P134 (BBa_K165055 in BBa_J63009)) are all completely wrong! Wrong size of bands and partially also the vector!

Induction of expression of CaDXMT1
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the start of the expression of CaDXMT1. This is the third and last gene, neccessary for caffeine- synthesis (previous transformation experiments did not work).
Operational sequence:
First of all, the OD600 of the over night culture was determined: 4,42 (0,442 at 1/10 dilution). Next, 200ml of SC-U 2% galactose medium were inoculated with an adequate amount of the over night culture (has grown in SC-U 2% glucose). Note: Not the whole amount of the calculated over night culture was centrifuged down. Thus, about 12 ml of glucose medium were given to the galactose medium. In theory, the expression will start a little bit later, due to the repression of the Gal1 promoter (glucose mediated).
Sampling:
15 min after induction (12:00 am) (OD600: 0,442)

Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was to take a 5 ml sample of the cell suspension 20h after expression induction.
Operational sequence:
At first, the OD600 was measured (1/10 dilution) and determined as 4,0. Afterwards, 5 ml of the cell suspension were taken out and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 4°C and 1500xg. The pellet was washed with 500µl of sterile water, followed by a second centrifugation step. The pellet was then stored at -80°C until cell lysis.
Cell lysis of stored pellets and SDS page
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was to isolate the protein crude extract out of the stored cell pellet.  Afterwards, we wanted to separate the proteins by SDS gel electrophoresis.
Operational sequence:
At first, we resuspended the frozen cell pellet in the adequate volume of breaking buffer (containing 1mM PMSF) to get an OD of 50.
CaDXMT1 (15 min after induction of expression): 42 µl breaking buffer (OD600: 0,42)
CaDXMT1 (20h after induction of expression): 400µl breaking buffer (OD600: 4,0)
The equal amount of glass beads was added, followed by 20- 30 steps of vortexing (30sek) and ice incubation (30sek).  Afterwards, the protein concentration was determined with NanoDrop (absorption at 280nm)
CaDXMT1 (15min): 17,2 mg/ml
CaDXMT1 (20h): 7,4 mg/ml
The protein crude extracts were diluted with breaking buffer, to get 10µl samples containing 30µg of protein crude extracts. The samples were mixed with 2,5µl Laemmli (non reducing) and boiled for 5 min. Afterwards, the samples were loaded on the gel, together with 6µl of prestained protein marker (PageRuler Plus) and 6µl unprestained protein marker.
The gel was performed at 120V, ca. 2h.
Western blot analysis of isolated protein crude extract
Investigator: Roman, Saskia
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the detection of the expressed enzyme CaDXMT1 in the isolated protein crude extract, having been separated on SDS page before (see above).
The proteins were blotted on a PVDF membran for 1h with 50mA. The membran was activated before blocking by 10min incubation in 100% methanol.
After blotting the proteins, we performed a reversible staining of the membran with Ponceau's reagent, to make the unprestained marker visible and to be able to assign it with a pen.

Staining with Ponceau's reagent and western blot analysis of protein crude extract of CaXMT1, CaMXMT1 and eGFP transformants after 20 minutes and 20 hours of expression
Investigator: Saskia
Aim of the experiment:
Detection of expressed proteins CaDXMT1, eGFP.
Operational sequence:
The western blot membran (having been blocked over the night at 4°C) was washed with PBS- T0.1 four times (4x 15min).  Because of the use of un- prestained protein marker (see Thursday, 6.9.), we stained the western blot membran with Ponceau's reagent and assigned the bands, followed by washing the membran with PBS- T0.1 again (15 minutes, 2x). Afterwards, the membran was incubated for 1h with detection reagent. Detection reagent:
10ml 1xPBS
0,2% BSA (0,02g have been weighted in)
2µl anti body MABclassic
After incubating with the first antibody, the membran was washed again with PBS-T0.1 three times (3x 5min), followed by the incubation with the second antibody (anti mouse, fused with alk. phosphatase) for another our. Second detection reagent:
10ml 1xPBS
0,2% BSA (see above)
5µl AntiMouse-alk. Phosphatase conjugate (1/2000 dilution)
The development was performed after washing the membran with PBS- T0.1 for 10 min (two times) and with 1xPBS for 10 min (two times). For this, the membran was shortly washed with AP buffer and then incubated with a solution containing 15ml AP buffer, 45µl BCIP (50mg/ml in DMF) and 7,5µl NBT (75mg/ml in 70% DMF) for a few minutes, until clear bands appeared.

Miniprep of over night cultures
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the isolation of pSB1C3 plasmids containing our three expression cartridges [Tef2PROM-CaXMT1-Adh1TER], [Tef1PROM-CaMXMT1-Adh1TER] and [Tef2PROM-CaDXMT1-Adh1TER]. After the isolation of these plasmids, we will perform a preparative digest with suitable enzymes, to generate the "caffeine synthesis device".
Operational sequence:
The plasmid isolation was done as previously described. Elution was carried out by using 40µl of elution buffer heated up to 37°C and incubating for 1 minute before the final centrifugation.
Afterwards, the concentration was determined with NanoDrop:
pSB1C3_[Tef2PROM-CaXMT1-Adh1TER]:  222,6 ng/µl
pSB1C3_[Tef1PROM-CaMXMT1-Adh1TER]: 180,3 ng/µl

Aim of the experiment:
Preparative digest previously to ligation (production of the "caffeine synthesis device"). To do this, we want to ligate the second and third expression cartridges consecutively on the first one. Since the length of the expression cassetts is almost the same as the vector backbone (pSB1C3), we make also use of the restriction enzyme Eco53KI which cuts that backbone, thereby enabling a satisfying separation on the agarose gel.

Investigator: Dennis
Aim of the experiment: ligation was performed for CaXMT1+CaMXMT1, incubated at 16 °C over night
Yeast expression: Pelletizing 16 h after expression induction
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was to pellet the 200ml cell suspension 16h after expression induction, as well as to wash the pellet with water, followed by storage at -20°C until further usage.
Operational sequence:
At first, the OD600 of the suspensions was determined:
CaXMT1: n.a.
CaMXMT1: 2,9/ml
CaDXMT1: n.a.
eGFP: 8,9/ml
Note:
Unfortunately, (almost) no colonies have grown of CaXMT1 and CaDXMT1. This is a bit strange, because the same medium was used at the inoculation and all colonies had grown in the SC-U 2% glucose medium. The induction of the expression will be repeated with these transformants.
The taken samples were centrifuged at 1500xg for 5 minutes at 4°C (200ml in several steps, eGFP 50ml in one step) and washed with 10 and 5 ml water, respectively. Afterwards, the suspension was centrifuged again and resuspended in 2ml water. The suspension was repelleted again and stored at -80°C until further usage.
Preparation of over night cultures
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the preparation of over night cultures of E.Coli- cells, having been transformed with the CaXMT1-, CaMXMT1- and CaDXMT1- expression cartridges, in order to have a sufficient amount of the plasmids (i.e. composite parts).
Operational sequence:
A single colony grown on LB agar plates with chloramphenicol was picked and used for inoculation of 6ml liquid LB medium containing 6µl of a chloramphenicol solution (final concentration: 30µg/ml). Incubation was done at 37°C over night with 180 rpm.
Harvesting of cells (S. cervisiae + pTUM104_Preprothaumatin)
Investigator: Martin, Alois
Aim of the experiment:
5. Determine the OD600 => 6.7. 6. Centrifuge the cells at 1,500 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. 7. Decant the supernatant (stored at 4°C; secreted thaumatin?). Resuspend cells in 8 ml of sterile water. 8. Transfer cells to a sterile centrifuge tube. Centrifuge samples for 30 seconds at top speed in the microcentrifuge. 9. Remove the supernatant. 10. Store the cell pellets at –80°C until ready to use. Proceed to the next section to prepare cell lysates to detect your recombinant protein (see next page).
Cell lysates:
2. Resuspend fresh or frozen cell pellets in 10 ml of breaking buffer. Centrifuge at 1,500 g for 5 minutes at 4°C to pellet cells. 3. Remove supernatant and resuspend the cells in a volume (180 ml) of breaking buffer to obtain an OD600 of 50–100. Use the OD600 determined in Step 5, previous page, to calculate the appropriate volume of breaking buffer to use. 4. Add an equal volume of acid-washed glass beads. 5. Vortex mixture for 30 seconds, followed by 30 seconds on ice. Repeat eight times. 6. Centrifuge in a centrifuge for 10 minutes at maximum speed. 7. Remove supernatant and transfer to a fresh microcentrifuge tube.

Enzyme assay and limonene extraction
Investigators: Andrea, Lara
Aim: Test functionality of purified enzyme.
Enzyme assay
All reactions and extractions were done in glass containers because limonene is very non-polar.
Enzyme assay was carried out in a total volume of 500 µl containing buffer (25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 % glycerol, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with cofactors (10 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA).
stock solutions were prepared:
1. 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.5 + 10 % glycerol
2. 1 M MgCl2
50 µM substrate (geranyl pyrophosphate, dissolved in DMSO) and 10 µg purified recombinant enzyme (extracted limonene synthase, after dialysis) were added.

The mixture was overlaid with 500 µl pentane (carefully, phases should not mix) and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. The reaction was stopped by vigorous mixing and centrifugation (5 min) to separate phases. The upper phase (solvent phase) was taken and put into a pasteur pipette which contained glass wool with Na2SO4 (to dry the solvent phase). Since the amount of pentane seemed to be insufficient (no solvent reached the GC glass container), the next two extractions were done with 1 ml of pentane each. Afterwards the combined extracts were reduced to approximately 300 µl under a stream of nitrogen.
3 replicates of negative control (reaction batch without enzyme) and enzymatic reaction batch were done.
The pentane extracts were analyzed with gas chromatography- mass spectrometry to identify the enzymatically formed products. An aliquot of each sample (0.5 µl) was injected into "5890 Series II GC" coupled to a "Finnigan Mat 55 S MS".
Preparation of yeast cultures for large scale expression (1l) 1
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the preparation of three 30ml yeast cultures (in selective SC-U 2% glucose medium), based on yeast clones transformed with pTUM104 vectors, each containing one of the three genes CaXMT1, CaMXMT1 and CaDXMT1 for having enough crude extract for further analysis.
Operational sequence:
If possible, a single colony which had grown on selective SC-U 2%glucose agar plates was used for inoculation of the 30ml liquid medium. If the density of the colonies was to high, a small amount (pipett dip) was taken.  The generated cell suspensions were incubated at 30°C over night.

High scale yeast expression: Induction
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the induction of the expression of the following three genes: CaXMT1, CMXMT1 and CaDXMT1. Previous attempts to do a high scale expression with these genes had failled, because the transformed yeast cells showed no growth after transferring them into 2% galactose containing induction medium.
Operational sequence:
As previously described, the OD600 of the over night cultures (in SC-U medium with 2% glucose) was determined. 1l of SC-U 2% galactose medium were inoculated with a calculated amount of pelleted over night cultures (to get an OD600 of ca. 0,4). The cultures were incubated at 30°C for 20 hours and then stored in the cooling room (4°C) until cell lysis.
Determined OD600 20h after induction:
CaXMT1: 5,5
CaMXMT1: 5,0
CaDXMT1: 4,9
In vitro reconstruction of the caffeine biosynthesis pathway: Enzyme assay
Investigator: Roman, Saskia
Aim of the experiments:
Aim of the experiment was the proof of enzyme function by reconstruction of the caffeine biosynthesis pathway.
Operational sequence:
The enzyme assay was performed as described in the paper of Hiroshi Sano et al., 2003. 100µl reaction volumes were prepared as follows:
50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0)

In vitro reconstruction of caffeine biosynthesis pathway: chloroform extraction
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the extraction of potential reaction products, to be able to start a LCMS analysis in order to detect the synthesized caffeine.
Operational sequence:
We added 1 ml of chloroform to the 100µl reaction batches, mixed a few seconds and stored the tubes for about 30 min at room temperature, to get a proper phase- separation. Afterwards, the lower phase (chloroform) was pipetted in tubes (glass tubes would have been better than plastic tubes) (1ml) and incubated for about 60 min at 60°C (=drying) until total chloroform removal.
The tubes were then stored at -80°C over night until further usage (LCMS)

In vitro reconstruction of caffeine biosynthesis pathway: LCMS analysis of extracted compounds
Investigator: Roman
Aim of the experiment:
Aim of the experiment was the detection of the chemical compounds, having been extracted of the reaction batch of our enzyme assay. We hoped to detect the metabolits 7- methylxanthine, theobromine (3,7- dimethylxanthine) and caffeine (1,3,7- trimethylxanthine).
Operational sequence:
First of all, the dried extract was solved in 200 µl of 70% methanol, mixed and than transferred into small glass tubes (LCMS tubes) and applied to the LCMS machine.
Results:
There were indeed two signals for theobromine and caffeine, howerver, these signals appeared in all samples, suggesting that it is not specific and belongs to the "background". A reason could be that the applied substrate xanthosine was not totally clean and contained small amounts of caffeine. If the enzymes had worked probably, we would have expected more significant signals. A reason could be that we had stored the enzymes for mor than two weeks at -80°C after the cell lyses and before using them for the enzyme assay. Maybe the experiment should be repeated with fresh isolated enzymes.
Analysis of yeasts' genome integration
Investigators: Martin
Aim: Study of genome integration Procedure: The clones of the experiment before were incubated in an over night culture, diluted to OD600 = 0.4 and put on a plate with G418 again to study the perseverance of antibiotics tolerance
Results: Of an overall number of 36 clones the experiment started with, 5 were already lost after the over night incubation (probably because of pipetting mistakes during the inoculation procedure on the 96-well plate). Of the 31 remaining plates, 21 were empty. The cfu of the positive plates were:
3
8
49
68
282
>1000
>10 000
>10 000
The plan is to PCR at least two of the clones to gain knowledge why there's been such drastic differences in the integration efficiency and endurance.

Transformation of P955+P963 (GAL4 based LSPS + reporter) and P959+P968 (LexA based LSPS + reporter) in Y190 S. cerevisiae with S. c. EasyComp Transformation Kit
Investigator: Jeff, Ingmar
Aim of the experiment: Transformation of P955+P963 (GAL4 based LSPS + reporter) and P959+P968 (LexA based LSPS + reporter) in Y190 S. cerevisiae with S. c. EasyComp Transformation Kit.
Procedure:
Co-transformation of P955+P963 (GAL4 based LSPS + reporter) and P959+P968 (LexA based LSPS + reporter) into Y190 S. cerevisiae cells was performed with the S. c. EasyComp Transformation Kit from Invitrogen after manufacturer's protocoll.
For each transformation we used 5 µg of DNA in total.
Transformation was performed after protocol with the only difference in the last step that we did't plated the transformated cell-suspension, but in liquid SC medium without LEU and URA (auxotrophic markers of plasmid with the light-switchable promoter systems and plasmid with the reporter constructs).
We did not add phycocyanobilin in the preculture here.
Also a negativ control (transformation without plasmids) was prepared.
The transformated cell suspension were incubated for 2 days in a 30 °C shaker at 200 rpm.
Addendum from October, 25th: only in the negativ control the cell suspension was still clear, the rest of the transformated cells were blurred. --> Succesfull co-transformation of both light-switchable systems and reporter constructs

Induction of the light-switchable promoter systems in Y190 S. cerevisiae with red light
Investigator: Jeff, Ingmar
Aim of the experiment: Induction of the light-switchable promoter systems in Y190 S. cerevisiae with red light. The induced light-switchable promoter system will hopefully switch on the gene expresesion of the reporter Renilla luciferase.
Procedure:
The 2 days old transformated Y190 yeast cell suspension were diluted until it reach an OD600 of ~0.5-0.6.
Phycocyanobilin (PCB), which we extracted moths ago, was added after steril-filtration into the medium (cend(PCB)=25 µM).
3 samples of each system were induced with full red light intensity, 2 samples of each system with 1/10 intensity and 2 samples of each system remain non-induced.
Every sample contains 3 ml cell suspension and was pipetted in a 4 ml cuvette.
Before start of the experiment, we took one sample for luciferase assay and OD600 measurement for getting the start value. (PCB was added, but we defined this sample as without PCB because PCB needs about 30 min to get into the cells)
The induction red-light-box was set up as following: Every 5 min there was a 10 s lasting red-light pulse with intensities as described.
Induction was performed overnight (15 h) at 30 °C in a 200 rpm shaker.

Aim of the experiment was the detection of the chemical compounds, having been extracted of the reaction batch of our enzyme assay. We hoped to detect the metabolits 7- methylxanthine, theobromine (3,7- dimethylxanthine) and caffeine (1,3,7- trimethylxanthine).
Operational sequence:
First of all, the dried extract was solved in 200 µl of 70% methanol, mixed and than transferred into small glass tubes (LCMS tubes) and applied to the LCMS machine.

Measurement of Renilla luciferase reporter activity of GAL4 and LexA based light-switchable promoter systems
Investigator: Jeff, Daniela
Aim of the experiment:: Measurement of Renilla luciferase reporter activity of GAL4 and LexA based light-switchable promoter systems.
Procedure:
Renilla luciferase reporter activity assay was performed with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System from Promega after manufacturer's protocol.
All values has been normalized to OD600 and dilution factors.
Theobromine Assay: chloroform extraction
Investigator: Saskia
Aim of the experiment:
Proof of caffeine synthase function by adding theobromine and SAM to S. cerevisiae culture transformed with pTUMcaffeine_expression_cassette.
Operational sequence:
We added 1 ml of chloroform to the 100µl reaction batches, mixed a few seconds and stored the tubes for about 30 min at room temperature, to get a proper phase- separation. Afterwards, the lower phase (chloroform) was pipetted in tubes (glass tubes would have been better than plastic tubes) (1ml) and incubated for about 60 min at 60°C (=drying) until total chloroform removal.
The tubes were then stored at -80°C over night until further usage (LCMS)

Headspace GC-MS of limonene
Investigator: Andrea
Aim: Check whether limonene is detectable in the brewed beer. Since extraction is time-consuming, SPME was done.
The SPME needle was injected into the headspace. Incubation for 30 min at 45 °C.
Injection into the GC (starting temperature: 40 °C)
