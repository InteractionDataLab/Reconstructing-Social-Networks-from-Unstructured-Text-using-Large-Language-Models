Participants of TU München iGEM 2012 survey auf einer größeren Karte anzeigen
The survey was sent to all contact addresses of iGEM Teams from this year.
Question 1:
Which iGEM Team do you belong to?
Question 2:
Do you use BioBricks from the registry for your project?
Question 3:
How would you describe the average quality of the part descriptions that you dealt with?
Question 4:
Do you think a standardization of the part descriptions could increase the usability of BioBricks in the future?
Question 5:
We propose to use a standardized form for the part descriptions of BioBricks in the Parts Registry similar to the following: [1] .
Would you like to use such a standardized template providing a structure in the source code that just needs to be completed?
Question 6:
Do you have suggestions what kind of additional information should be included in the standardized part descriptions? So far the following information are included: * keywords, abbreviations, other versions of the BioBrick, RFC standard, deleted restriction sites, truncations of the nucleotidesequence - if coding for proteins * amino acid replacements, posttranslational modifications, enzymatic activities, cytotoxicity, source of the construct, originating organism, codonoptimization, literature references, sequence references, structure references.
Question7:
Do you have any other suggestions how the usability of BioBricks could be increased by better describing them?
