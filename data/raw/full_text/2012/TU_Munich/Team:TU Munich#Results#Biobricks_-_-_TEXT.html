Experiences with existing BioBricks
Rating working BioBricks: BBa_K300007
Yeast Integration Vector BBa_K300007 (Partly showed functionality)
Identification of incorrect BioBricks: BBa_K268000
Forbidden restriction sites in pSB6A0 (BBa_K268000g)
Improvement of an existing BioBrick: BBa_K801100
In 2012 the Registry of Standard Biological Parts defined <partinfo>BBa_J04450</partinfo> as the standard shipping part that is required for submission of backbones, creating the need for a RFC25 compatible standard shipping part.
We extended the standard compability of the RFP coding device (<partinfo>BBa_J04450</partinfo>) to RFC10 and RFC25 by adding the NgoMIV and AgeI restriction sites into the prefix and suffix of this part. Additionally two AgeI restriction sites that were present in the generator itself were deleted.
This part may be used as a standard insert for RFC10 as well as RFC25 backbones. This improvement became necessary because insertion of <partinfo>BBa_J04450</partinfo> into a RFC25 compatible backbone leads to the deletion of the desired RFC25 restriction sites that are needed for protein fusions.
