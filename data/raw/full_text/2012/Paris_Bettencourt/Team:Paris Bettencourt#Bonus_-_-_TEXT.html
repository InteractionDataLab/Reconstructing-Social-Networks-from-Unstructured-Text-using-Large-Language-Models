Adaptation of Robert Frost`s The road not taken by Julianne Rieders
Two gradients diverged on a bacteria lawn
And sorry I could not swim towards both
But be one bacteria amongst many spawn
And feeling with out glucose tired and drawn
I looked at the path that would foster my growth
Then took the other one, just as fair
And having perhaps the better claim
For it was nutrient rich and wanted wear
Though as for that, the colonizing there
Had worn them really about the same
And both that morning equally lay
In LBA no contaminants had debased
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way
I doubt my steps I will retrace
I shall be telling this with a ligand
Somewhere minutes and minutes hence,
Two gradients in a lawn did bend
And I, I sought the one that would amend
And that has made all the difference
Adaptation of Robert Frosts` Fire and Ice by Julianne Rieders
In bioremediation iGEMMERS feel the need is dire
For a robust biological containment device
And we agree with those who desire
Quantification, and require
Understanding of the benefits and the price
Through public discussion and debate
To improve our biological containment device
And generate
Containment systems that will suffice
