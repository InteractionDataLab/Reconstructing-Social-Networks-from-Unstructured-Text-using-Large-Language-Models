For the Laboratory's facilities, we are kindly hosted by the CRI/INSERM U1001 that lends us benches, microscopes and others facilities as well as their expertise and their cheerfulness! Also, we would like to thank Chantal Lotton who is the lab manager for her advices on the bench and who ensures we worked safely, Aleksandra Nivina, Antoine Decrulle, Babak Nichabouri, Yifan Yang and Edwin Wintermute, our advisors who made themselves available at any time.
We would also like to thank Laura Ciriani, who leads the Association SCIRE that took good care of our money, as well as Céline Garrigues and Véronique Waquet, the secretary staff of the CRI for their help and advice in the administrative tasks and commercial relations every team has to face.
