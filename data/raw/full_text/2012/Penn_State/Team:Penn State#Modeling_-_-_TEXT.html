Main Results
Included here are the pooled results of each project. All results are measurements of fluorescence performed by a TECANM1000 instrument. For detailed discussion, please see the individual project pages .
BiDirectional Promoter Project Data
Here we can see some of the data collected for the Bidirectional Promoter Project. The data shows the fluorescence of GFP and RFP from different promoters collected by the TCAN.
GFP Data for all of the samples tested and the average of those samples for a given construct. The promoters tested so far are BBa_J23102 , and three custom palindromic promoters.
Multiple Start Codon Project Data
Here is some of the preliminary data for the MSC Project. The graph depicts the fluorescence measured by expression from each individual start codon.
Codon Optimization
Here is some of the preliminary data for the Codon Optimization Project. The graph depicts the fluorescence measured in each threonine codon 6-repeat sequence.
