The light parts for our project (TULIPs) were obtained from the Glotzer Lab at the University of Chicago through Addgene. The Boeke Lab at the Johns Hopkins Medical School provided lab materials and space for benchwork.  Dr. Karen Zeller helped advise and instruct our Yeast Golden Gate Parts course. The iGEM team members performed all the work involved in this project unless otherwise indicated.
