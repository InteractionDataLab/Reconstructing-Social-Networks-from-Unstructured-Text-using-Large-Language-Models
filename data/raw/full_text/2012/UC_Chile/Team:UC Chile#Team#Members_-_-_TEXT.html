Attribution
We would like to start by saying that many people helped throughout this project, many of whom are not mentioned in the Wiki (but we had to at the end of the day for political reasons). Any attempt of acknowledging them (them=other team members) falls short of reality...
It is impossible to express the amount of gratitute that really all the people that were involved in the realization of the project deserve. Your counsel, moral support, financing, help in many different ways were fundamental for the realization of the project... Eternal thanks.
