The following entry was written by: Simón
Competent cells were transformed with the following BBs from the 2012 distribution kit
Plasmid resistance in bold
C K515105 = constitutive promoter + rbs + sfGFP
A E0422 = rbs + CFP.lva.tag + term
A K145015 = GFP.lva.tag
A J04630 = GFP + double.term
A E0432 = rbs + YFP.lva.tag + double.term
A I763020 = rbs + GFP.lva.tag + doulbe.term
C K325902 = rbs + luxC + rbs + luxD
C K325903 = rbs + luxE + RBS + luxG
Transformations with K325902 & K325903 weren´t succesful.
