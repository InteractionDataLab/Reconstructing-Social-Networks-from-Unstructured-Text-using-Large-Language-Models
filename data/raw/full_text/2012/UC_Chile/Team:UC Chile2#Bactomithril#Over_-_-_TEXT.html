Attribution
Spider dragline silk is an exceptionally strong and elastic fiber and is an ideal material for numerous biomedical and industrial applications. In this secondary project we developed a novel secretion system that allows to export proteins to the extracellular medium and added the first spider-silk biobrick to the Registry. This biobrick contains the synthetic silk gene ADF-3 from the orb weaving spider Araneus diadematus.
