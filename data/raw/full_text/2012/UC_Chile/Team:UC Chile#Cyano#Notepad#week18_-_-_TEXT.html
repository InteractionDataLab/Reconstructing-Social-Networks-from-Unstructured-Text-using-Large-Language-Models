July 2 - July 8
Monday: DAY OFF!! Some sort of catholic holiday I belive... our university takes those very seriously.
Ok. Simon and Carla will not be around this week because you know... they thought they had such great grades and could skip the exam... the thing is they didn't have great grades so... ouch. Simon is coming back on wednesday and carla on friday.
Friday: it's been an extremely cold day. Winter is finally upon us and you could feel it. Carla came back after a 4 hour exam and is exhausted.
