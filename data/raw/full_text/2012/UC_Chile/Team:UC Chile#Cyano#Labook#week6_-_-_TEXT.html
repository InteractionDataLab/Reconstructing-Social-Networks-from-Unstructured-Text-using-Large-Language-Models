April 9 - April 15
Monday
PCR for C1 parts.
Tuesday
PCR for C1. Problematic parts: KanR.
Wednesday
Started growth curve for our culture of Synechocystis PCC6803.
Gel purification of previous PCR run.
Friday
PCR for C1 parts.
Some conclusions: PCR and gel electrophoresis -> DNA from synechocystis used as template is not good enough. Genomic amplicons are not coming out right. As many PCR's have had bad results, we will use old PCR DNA as template and not genomic nor plasmid DNA.
