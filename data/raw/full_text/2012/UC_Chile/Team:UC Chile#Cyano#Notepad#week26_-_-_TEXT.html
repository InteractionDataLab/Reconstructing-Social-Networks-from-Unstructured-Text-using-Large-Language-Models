August 27 - September 2
Wednesday Oh. We realize we have our first deadlines for the next week u.u So a meeting was arranged on today to divide tasks and plan the last month of work. Apart from being a typical late pizza meeting that finished by 11 pm the most interesting event was that Carla broke Pollak's google mug (crazyengineer believes that Pollak has loved that mug more than any other girl in his life). Yeah, you probably could think it was payback for the broken watch and the coffee but still, maybe breaking the mug was a little hmmm... over the edge?
Dr. Gutiérrez left us to go to Spain to a congress, but still is watching closely over us with his lab cam I-Phone application (well... this application does not really exist...yet). He wants us to send all of the wiki writings by next Friday.
Saturday Carla went over to Simon's place to write the first abstract draft.
