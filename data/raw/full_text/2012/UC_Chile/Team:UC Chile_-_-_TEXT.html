Luxilla Biolamp takes advantage of one the most fascinating natural phenomena: bioluminescence.
We chose for the chassis the cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC 6803, because it is a photoautotroph and is regulated by circadian rhythms.
Using the lux operon and circadian promoters, we designed two plasmids: the Luciferase generator is to produce bioluminiscence, and the substrate generator recovers substainably the substrates necessary for the reactions.
We achieved to transform Synechocystis with the luciferase generator plasmid, and verificated light emission in a luminometer.
Al being lit by bioluminescent bacteria!
