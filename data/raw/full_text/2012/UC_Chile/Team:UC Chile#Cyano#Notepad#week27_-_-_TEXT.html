September 3 - September 9
We have deadlines coming up by Friday u.u (damn... remember the Friday song... again u.u)
Tasks were divided to make work more efficient. Tama and Isaac are in charge of the biosafety questions. Track selection was already chosen and the first abstract of the project was written by Simon and Carla last Saturday. Pollak is in the correction stage and Carla is getting the signed approval of the Bioethics and Biosafety Board of the university (she is psychopathically stalking the board members outside their offices). The final roster is uploadead and the fee... well, we are waiting for our university to pay!
Friday
First deadline requirements completed! Great Work Beerdragons! Tama came up with an interesting model to ensure the biosafety of our systems, but is so awesome we won't talk about it.
Spend most of the afternoon choosing a name for the project (crazyengineer is still upset by the rejection of the name "Beerdragon" which thinks is the most suitable and most representative word to define the project). After about three hours of thinking about names (yeah... Friday night, seven months of work, classes to attend, you could feed a baby with my brain right now... ideas were clearly not coming up) we made our choice: LUXILLA. It has light (lux) and oscillates in time = LUXILLA (hmmm... maybe the phonetics made more sense in Spanish).
And all the wiki info was successfully compiled and sent to Dr. Gutiérrez's mail :)
