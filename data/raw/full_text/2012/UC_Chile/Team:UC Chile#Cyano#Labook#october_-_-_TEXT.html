Synechocystis PCC 6803 cells were transformed with BBa_K743018 and BBa_K73010.  Positive colonies appeared in both plates.
A Gibson assembly and a transformation were done to modify construct BBa_K743015. The promoter pta (short) was exchanged for pta (length= 1 kb). This construct was validated by PCR and digestion.

Bioluminiscence of Synechocystis cells transformed with BBa_K743014 and BBa_K743015 was measured in a High-sensitive camera.
