Overview
Spider dragline silk is an exceptionally strong and elastic fiber and is an ideal material for numerous biomedical and industrial applications. In this secondary project we developed a novel secretion system that allows to export proteins to the extracellular medium and tried to add the first spider-silk biobrick to the Registry. This biobrick would have the synthetic silk gene ADF-3 from the orb weaving spider Araneus diadematus. Nevertheless, due to the repetitive nature of the spider silk monomer we could not finish this biobrick for the Regional Jamboree (despite several attempts and strategies).

Introduction
Spider dragline silk is an exceptionally strong and elastic biomaterial and one of the strongest natural fibers known. It is five times stronger by weight than steel and three times tougher than the top quality man-made fiber Kevlar [1]. That is why it is referred to as “biosteel”. Furthermore, this material is biocompatible, biodegradable and has potential for processing in aqueous solution under ambient conditions.
These properties make the spider silk an ideal material for numerous industrial applications such as bullet-proof vests, parachutes, seat belts and composite materials in aircraft, and a promising substance for biomedical applications such as drug delivery systems and scaffolds for tissue engineering.
The excellent mechanical properties and low immunogenicity of spider webs have fascinated the man for thousands of years, but unfortunately large scale farming of spiders is not convenient because of the highly territorial and aggressive character of these arthropods. Synthetic spider silk production is a promising way to make use of this exceptional biomaterial.
Construct: a novel secretion system
Working Plasmid ( BBa_K43011 )
This is an intermediate plasmid that we used to build the GFP Reporter Plasmid an the Protease Producer Plasmid.
GFP Reporter Plasmid ( BBa_K43012 )
The description of the mechanism of this construct is explained in the animation below.
Protease Producer Plasmid ( BBa_K43013 )
This construct induces the expression of the HIV protease.

In this section you will find the complete description of our work in this project.
Results
You can see detailed informarion of our results in this section . Nevertheless, we can briefly summarize the following: we know that sfGFP expresses in our e. coli, but we don’t know if it is attached to the external side of the membrane, or if the HIV-1 protease works as expected. As this secretion system seems to be failing, we chose to try other alternatives.
Future Prospects: The construction of the first spider silk biobrick
We tried with a lot of patience (in SEVERAL attempts with many different strategies) to make a biobrick with the spider silk monomer ADF-3 or the sequence of DNA corresponding to ADF-3 and tags necessary to identify and export the protein with the Type 3 Secretion System of Salmonella (SPI 2). The original sequences are described in

This sequence was kindly sent by Dr. Christopher Voigt to us.
A detailed description of this work is in the notebook section . After tons of hours of hard work, when we finally obtained PCR amplified bands of the correct size, the digestion tests were positive, colony PCR were succesful and Gibson Assemblies seemed to work, we sent our final construct for sequencing and the results did not match with our designs. Probably this is due to the hihgly repetitive nature of the spider silk monomers.
