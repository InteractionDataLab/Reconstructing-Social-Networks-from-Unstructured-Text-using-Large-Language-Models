Monthly Summary
We are waiting for Gibson enzymes to arrive. So there is no much wet lab work this month.
PCR runs
While waiting for enzymes, all parts for future assemblies are being prepared.
Problematic parts: Kanr, P1003, B0014.
Tried with different DMSO concentrations. Best result at 5%.
Comments: we realized that our current primers work for P1003+B0015. Right primers were now ordered.
After arrival, no amplification for Kanr. Tried once more with an old Kanr purification: success.
New batch of competent cells prepared: Competence: 3.5x10^7 (not quite sure)
Gibson enzymes arrived late June.
