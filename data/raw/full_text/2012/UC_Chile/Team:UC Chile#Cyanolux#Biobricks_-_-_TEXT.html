Plasmid backbones
pSB1C3_IntK (BBa_K743006)
Neutral recombination plasmid backbone. Kanamycin resistance as a selectable marker for integration. EcoRI restriction site in RS2. Plasmid backbone designed for Gibson Assembly.
pSB1C3_IntS (BBa_K743010)
Suceptibility generating plasmid backbone. Spectinomycin resistance as a selectable marker for integration. mRFP1 under constitutive promoter in E.coli for negative selection of standard assembly.
Biobricks and Constructs
BBa_K743000
First recombination site of IntK plasmid backbone.
BBa_K743001
Second recombination site of IntK plasmid backbone. Illegal EcoRI restriction site present. As it always is used as a downstream part, illegal site does not interfere with Standard Assembly.
BBa_K743002
Synechocystis PCC. 6803 Citocrome C promoter.
BBa_K743009
pSB1C3_IntK(BBa_K743006) with mRFP1 under Synechocystis PpsaAB promoter.
BBa_K743016
pSB1C3_IntK(BBa_K743006) with mRFP1 under Synechocystis PpsbA2 promoter.
BBa_K743014
pSB1C3_IntK(BBa_K743006) with LuxAB genes from Photorhabdus luminescent under Synechocystis Transaldolase promoter.
BBa_K743015
pSB1C3_IntK(BBa_K743006) with LuxAB genes from Vibrio fisherii under Synechocystis Transaldolase promoter.
BBa_K743018
pSB1C3_IntK(BBa_K743006) with sfGFP gene with rapid degradation tag under Synechocystis Transaldolase promoter.
