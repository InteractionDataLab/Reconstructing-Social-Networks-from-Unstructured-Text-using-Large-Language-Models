LuxBrick Characterization - (BBa_K325909)
As a part of our project, we set out to investigate the conditions which affect the output of the LuxBrick. As we are using various elements from this Biobrick, we believe that is cornersome to know how we may increase its output by modifying the conditions that affect its behaviour.
We set out to understand diverse factors that could be influencing the total bioluminescence yield of the brick. Some of them have direct relation with some of the aspects of our project. These factors are:
Glucose concentration
Growth state at time of induction
Cell mass
Temperature
Here you'll find detailed the characterization methods we used in this experiment.
Glucose concentration in media
HERE THERE SHOULD BE SOME TEXT SUPPORTING THE EXPERIMENT HOPEFULLY WITH CITATION. FOR EXAMPLE: Glucose is most important energy source of bacteria. As glucose is catabolized into pyrovate ...
Growth state at-time-of-induction
HERE THERE SHOULD BE SOME TEXT SUPPORTING THE EXPERIMENT HOPEFULLY WITH CITATION. It has been know for some time that general bacterial metabolism is principally determined its growth state. Growth states involve the expression of different sigma factors according to the metabolic status of the bacteria. The transcription of certain sequences directly depend on this, as some promoters are only read by the RNA polymerase when sigma70 is present in the cell. (TO BE CONTINUED)

Photons, cells. Impedance?
