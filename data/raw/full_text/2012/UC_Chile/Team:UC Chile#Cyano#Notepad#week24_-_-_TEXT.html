After last week's declaration, crazyengineer decided to quit forever and dedicate the rest of his/her life to sow the fields and cultivate apples. Well...not yet, but if life continues to go on like this I'll probably will. I'm wondering why I entered engineering school in the first place... oh, I remember: I'm a masochist.
Now, as I haven't been around in the lab much (stupid engineering tests) I'm going to make you lose the Game. The following extract is taken from Wikipedia:
"The Game is a mental game where the objective is to avoid thinking about The Game itself. Thinking about The Game constitutes a loss, which, according to the rules of The Game, must be announced each time it occurs. It is impossible to win most versions of The Game; players can only attempt to avoid losing for as long as they possibly can. The Game has been variously described as pointless and infuriating, or as challenging and fun to play. As of 2010, The Game is played by millions worldwide, although in theory, the whole world is playing it.
Rules
There are three commonly reported rules to The Game: Everyone in the world is playing The Game. (Sometimes narrowed to: "Everybody in the world who knows about The Game is playing The Game", or alternatively, "You are always playing The Game.") A person cannot not play The Game; it does not require consent to play and one can never stop playing. Whenever one thinks about The Game, one loses. Losses must be announced to at least one person (either by using a statement such as "I lost The Game" or by alternative means)." (end of extract).
