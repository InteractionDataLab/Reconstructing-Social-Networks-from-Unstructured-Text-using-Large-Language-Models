August 20 - August 26
Thursday A while back Carla thought about doing an activity with Penta UC kids. Penta UC is a program of our university that gives opportunities to kids with a socially disadvantageous background by enrolling them in different classes (according to their age of course). So today we found out that the teacher in charge of the biology class actually works in the lab next door and can give us space in his class... this Saturday and this Saturday alone. So here we are, preparing like a 100 LB plates by Saturday.  We'd like to thank Clarita for making the contact!!! She's the one that bore with our crazyness during January when we were working in the lab in the first floor. Thanks again! Saturday Today was an awesome day! We spend the morning teaching 12 year old's about biology and RFP. And they BEHAVE! Beautiful. Check Human Practices for more details.
