ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.......... ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh............. ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.............
This is my last entry to the wiki. It's been awesome to write what's been going on in the last pfff... seven months! although I must confese it was really tedious at times.
Bernardo, Tama and Isaac have not slept since Sunday running the last experiments, so we are all trying to keep them on earth.
Right now, we are just finishing uploading everything.
I hope to see you at the Regional Jamboree in Colombia.
Long life to the beerdragon!Peace, out.
