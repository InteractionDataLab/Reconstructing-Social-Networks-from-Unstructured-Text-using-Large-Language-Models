Synechocystis PCC 6803 growth curve
When we started working on the project we realized that although we could manage to acquire an inoculum of Synechocystis PCC 6803 from a laboratory in our faculty, no protocols were standardized in that lab for using Synechocystis for research. That meant obtaining protocols and trying them out. Also, it meant we had to set the conditions for growing them to do all the experiments in due time. Actually, we started out using the conditions set for the growth of many other cyanobacteria, but after a couple of failed transformations we decided to build our own Synechocysistis incubator (you can find a DIY guide over here ).
Here we show our growth curve for Synechocystis PCC 6803 using the conditions set in our shaking incubator (40uE/s²/m²), 90 RPM, 30°C.
