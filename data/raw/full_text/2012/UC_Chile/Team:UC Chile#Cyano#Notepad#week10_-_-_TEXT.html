Well... we believe we have just found the root of all evil: our Gibson master mix. Its efficiency is way lower compared to the master mix used during the introductory course. So, we made new master mix, new competent colis (we ran out of them), tried gibson with new mix and transformed. Hope it works this time!!!!!!
Tuesday
NEW PRIMERS IN DA HOUSE!!!! Made PCR runs for the parts of the new constructs we are going to assemble (with the new primers). Also, digested pPMQAK1 to get rid of the incorporated toxin. We plan to transform coli with new constructs, pPMQAK1 and digested pPMQAK1.
Had another pizza orgy!!! Started making plans to buy our own mountain (apparently you can do that in this country u.u).
Finished last PCR run at 23.00 (new record).
Wednesday
Tried protocol to ged rid of gremlins in the lab.
AHHHHHH POR QUÉ? NOOOOOO MALDITOS GELES (poem by B. Pollak) (Translation: AHHHHHH WHY? NOOOOO DAMN GELS)
Thursday
Reinoculated synechocystis. Getting our bacteria ready for tomorrow's transformation :) Minipreped lux brick, digested pPMQAK1 and pPMQAK1. Transformed future useful parts from the registry. We have not yet transformed tuesday's PCR u.u Also, compared (again) old master mixes, failed master mix and fresh master mix with a Gibson assembly for sfGFP.
Finished with a measurement of competence for our E. colis using pSB1C3.
