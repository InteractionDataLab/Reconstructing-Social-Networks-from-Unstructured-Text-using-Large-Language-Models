Tuesday
We purified parts for Construct 1 and then assembled them by Gibson. Hope everythings works out. Simon was wearing his Gibson Les Paul T-shirt so we kinda hope that the power of rock leads us through the good side of the force.
Also, have you ever seen a centrifuge dance? It's pretty funny actually.In one step of the purification, the protocol stated "centrifuge with lid open"
So we did...and it danced...

Conclusion: absolutely nothing is more powerful than rock!

Seven a.m., waking up in the morning. Gotta be fresh, gotta go downstairs...

Started preparing parts for Construct 2 by PCR.
Here is Simon heroically diminishing his life span for the success of Construct2.
Although he actually seems to be enjoying it...
To do:
Assemble C2.1 and C2.2. Characterization of psAB and psbA2 promoters.
