1) First Secretion System
Working Plasmid
This is an intermediate plasmid that we used to build the GFP Reporter Plasmid an the Protease Producer Plasmid.
GFP Reporter Plasmid
The description of the mechanism of this construct is explained in the animation below.
Protease Producer Plasmid
This construct induces the expression of the HIV protease.
