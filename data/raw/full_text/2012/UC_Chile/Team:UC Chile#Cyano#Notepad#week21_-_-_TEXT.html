July 23 - July 29
Monday: Bands corresponding to Lux CD and Lux EG were purified. An electrophoresis gel was run for RS2 colony PCR product (with no extra restriction site) and Lux CDEG.
Correct size plasmid was extracted from respective colonies and then digested. Size was checked again by a gel electrophoresis run. Finally it was ligated to B0014 and B0015.
Crazyengineer also left today. Needed more days to found his/herself, some say actually left to find the beerdragon... who knows? Be back next week.
All things going ok in the lab.
