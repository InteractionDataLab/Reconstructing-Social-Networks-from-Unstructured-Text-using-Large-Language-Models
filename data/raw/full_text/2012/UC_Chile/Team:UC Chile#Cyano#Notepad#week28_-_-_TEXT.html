September 10 - September 16
While the whole country is celebrating independece day (actually Chilean independence was signed in February, but that's another story) we are here at the lab, trying to wrap up the last seven months of work. The barbecue odor reaches our lab which is in a seventh floor (¬¬ not nice). We are managing to build up the biosafety construct, designing our biolamp (should be ready by the first week of October) and styling the wiki.
