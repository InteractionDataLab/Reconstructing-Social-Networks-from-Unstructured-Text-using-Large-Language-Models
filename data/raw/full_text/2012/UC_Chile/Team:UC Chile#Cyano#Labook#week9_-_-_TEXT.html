April 30 - May 6
Monday
Electrophoresis for constructs C1.1 and C1.2 assembled through Gibson. Wrong size.
PCR run of parts C1.1 and C1.2 for new Gibson.
Tuesday
KanR + double terminator has strange results. An analytic digestion will be done to check insertion.
As Gibson assembly is not working, we still need to try if pPMQAK1 works in synechocystis. We'll take out the toxic by standard assembly and transform Synechocystis afterwards.
Negative control of competent cells with pPMQAK1 was positive. Possible contamination.
There are colonies in Gibson negative controls.
Wednesday
Gibson assembly for C1.1, C 1/2 and positive control.
Friday
Colony PCR for C1 and C1/2.
New competent cells prepared.
