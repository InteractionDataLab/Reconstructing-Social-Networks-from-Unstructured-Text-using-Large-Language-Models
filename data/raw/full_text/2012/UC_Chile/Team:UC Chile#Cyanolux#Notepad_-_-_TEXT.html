Here you'll find our lab book containing our week to week progress in the wet lab and our notebook (or quest to destroy the ring) containing our thoughts, mishappenings, failures, successes and our experience in general during the last months. Our notebook is intented to be a funny way to document what has happened to us so don't take it too seriously!
Here you can find out what did in December. (e.g. the course on Synthetic Biology)
