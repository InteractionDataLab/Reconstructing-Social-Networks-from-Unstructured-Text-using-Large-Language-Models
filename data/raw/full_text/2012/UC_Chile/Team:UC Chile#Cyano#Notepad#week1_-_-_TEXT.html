Writing... here... Getting used to university and lab again. Had our first meetings to do labour division. Basically we decided to work in two teams: Cyanolight and Bactomithril. People cyano: Carla (group chief-beerdragon major), Simón, Tama, Isaac and Seba. People bactomithril: Max (group chief), Bryon, Emilia, Claudia and Ulises. Rolando will be our official cheerleader. Pollak will be all over the place.
There are no more entries until week 6!
