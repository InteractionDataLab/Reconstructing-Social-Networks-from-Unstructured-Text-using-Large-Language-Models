Utah 2010 iGEM team
As part of our Synechocystis transformation strategies we devised using psb1C3_IntC plasmid developed by 2010 iGEM Utah team. We sent them an e-mail asking for DNA which they sent to us. Thanks guys!!!
Peter Lindblad - Uppsala University
Dr. Lindblad is the head of a research group that has published about molecular tools for synthetic biology in cyanobacteria.
When we were planning transformation strategies for Synechocystis we found literature about pPMQAK1 plasmid developed by his team.
By February we contacted Dr. Lindblad and asked him for pPMQAK1 DNA which he kindly sent to us.
Chris Voigt - MIT
At the end of March we sent an e-mail to professor Voigt asking him for spider silk monomers ADF-1,2,3 that his team used in the paper: "Engineering the Salmonella type III secretion system to export spider silk monomers". We planned to use those sequences to build spider silk biobricks and to engineer E. coli to secrete these monomers.
TU_Munich 2012 iGEM team
Munich team sent us this badge with a quaint fat and alcoholic German guy as a present for having answered their survey about IP rights.
Valencia and Copenhagen 2012 iGEM teams
As these teams are working in a project similar to ours we contacted them with a collaboration in mind. We exchanged a few e-mails and had a couple of Skype meetings. We suggested to exchange constructs, however, they had nothing ready by the time.
