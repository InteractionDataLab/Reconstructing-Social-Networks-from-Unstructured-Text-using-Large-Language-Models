April 23 - April 29
Tuesday
Did a restriction digest of construct 1 to check if it is really what we wanted to assemble. We believe it's not.  We are strongly considering to start work from scratch. (Order primers again and so on).
Simon confessed that he didn't like classic rock, Bernardo tried to fix his headphones with a soldering gun and Carla quit Proba.
Getting ready for Ingenia fair at engineering faculty tomorrow!!!
Wednesday
Spent the morning talking about our project at engineering faculty. At least 30 people are interested in  participating next year. For details check out our human practices section.
Today is Carla's birthday. In the spirit of celebration, we ordered pizza-cake and she could blow out her candles. Happy 20 years!
Finally, run 42 PCR's to check if the parts assembled by gibson were correct. We included the digested contructs. Waiting for tomorrow's results.
Thursday
Weird things are happening. The desired parts have wrong weights so clearly they are not what we want. The constructs don't have all the parts. Some have two or three and none is complete.
Second day at Ingenia fair.
Had a few  gourmet drinks to cheer up the team!
Friday
Did one last PCR run with parts that correctly assembled. We are going to build our desired construct from the good parts of the former ones. Frankenson is on! (Frankenstein Gibson).
First rainny day of the season! Brace yourselves, winter is coming.
Saturday
Checked the PCR results and they are not what we expected. Parts that supposedly were together are not in the right weight. Still, we did the corresponding Frankenson.
