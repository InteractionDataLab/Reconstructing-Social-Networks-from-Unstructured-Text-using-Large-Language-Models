April 30 - May 6
Monday
Did a massive PCR run. We amplified every part of Construct 1 using as template old PCR purifications and PCR products. We'll build C1 from scratch. Hoping everything works out well this time.
As an inspirational motif:
Muchos años después, al frente del pelotón de fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano Buendía había de recordar aquella remota tarde en que su padre lo llevó a conocer el hielo.
These are the first lines of A hundred years of solitude by G.G. Márquez :)
Tuesday
We decided to transform e. coli with the expression plasmid pPMQAK1. Also, as the mentioned plasmid contains ccdb toxin, we took it out by a digestion/ligation procedure and transformed again.  Transformed e. coli with GFP coding device.
During the afternoon, we checked yesterday's PCR's under UV light. Luckily, all parts amplified except for KanR u.u Did a PCR run for KanR alone. We tried with different master mix combinations, some containing GC buffer and some with DMSO.
Existential Question: WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU HAVE A GREMLIN PLAGUE IN THE LABORATORY??
Got it!! Use a protocol!
Need to adapt one ;)
Wednesday
Talked with one of our advisors today. He gave us interesting input on our failed PCR's.
Checked PCR runs. KanR didn't have the strenght we'd have liked, but still we used it. All parts were assembled by Gibson. Also, every part has its neg. control. After Gibson, we transformed coli in kan, chlor and both resistance plates.
Friday
Happy Star Wars day!!!! May the fourth be with you :)
