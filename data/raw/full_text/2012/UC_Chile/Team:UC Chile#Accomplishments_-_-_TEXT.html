Judging Criteria
We believe our team deserves the following medal:  ☐Bronze ☐Silver ✓Gold
Because we met the following criteria
Bronze:
✓ Team registration
✓ Complete Judging form
✓ Team Wiki
☐ Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree (Well, we are going to so next week!)
✓ At least one new submitted and well-characterized standard BioBrick Part or Device. A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts.
We submitted parts BBa_K743000 and BBa_K743001 which were verified by digestion and sequencing. The functioning of these parts was extensively proved by our successful transformation of synechocystis that is well documented in our results . We also characterized the functioning of KanR resistance genes P1003 and P1007 in Synechocystis PCC6803. Lastly, we quantitatively characterized the Luxbrick in different temperature, O.D, glucose concentration and growth fase conditions.
Regarding to failed parts characterization, we made a luciferase bioluminescence assay for BBa_K743014 and for BBa_K743015 , what proved wrong the Pta promoter . A luciferase bioluminescence assay was also made to test the Bacterial Lux reporter CDEG pλ AB BBa_K325905 .
Silver:
In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements...
✓ Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected
Parts BBa_K743000 and BBa_K743001 worked as expected in Synechocystis double homologous recombination transformations. Part BBa_K743017 showed inducible expression as planned. Device BBa_K743006 showed the right results, i.e was useful for transformation and selection in Synechocystis.
✓Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
Device BBa_K743006 undergoes double homologous recombination in Synechocystis PCC6803 and confers kanamycin resistance. Other sequences can be added to it and its effectiveness remains as shown in BBa_K743005
Gold:
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, any one or more of the following:
☐ Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year) and enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), and don't forget to create a new registry page for the improved part.
☐ Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
✓Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
We proposed a new and simple biosafety strategy designed to be easily adopted in all biobricks. It will need minimal imputs. For more information please check our biosafety section. Furthermore, we organized a Synthetic Biology workshop with worldwide renown investigators in the field as lecturers. This will be the first occasion of its kind in Chile and we are sure its going to be a milestone in the history of SynBio in our country.
