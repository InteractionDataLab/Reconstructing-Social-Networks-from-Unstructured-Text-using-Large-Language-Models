Batch full of competent cells. OD: 0.495
Ligation
LuxCD +LuxEG in pSB4K5 (L1) and pSB1K3 (L2).
Gibson: sfGFP in pSB4K5. Assembly made to test new competent cells
Transformation
Plates
L1: Ligated LuxCD +LuxEG in pSB4K5 at 1:1 and 1:10 L2: Ligated LuxCD +LuxEG in pSB1K3 at 1:1 and 1:10 G+: Gibson sfGFP in pSB4K5 PUC19 (AMP) x3: to test our new competent cells, 20µL of transformed bacteria were plated.
Tuesday
Transformation results
PUC19-1: 148 colonies PUC19-2: 177 colonies PUC19-3: 155 colonies L1 and L2 with colonies. Colony PCR will be done. G+ Positive results. Several colonies. Probably due to: the problem with the Gibson assembly could be the use of E. cloni instead of TOP10.
Colony PCR for LuxCDEG in pSB1K3: Negative. PCR will be tried.
Colony PCR for LuxCDEG in pSB4K5 was not done due to all colonies that grew were red. It was assumed LUXCDEG did not integrate.
PCR for RS1-Kan-B0015-RS2 (chloramphenicol resistance) and electrophoresis: primers form dimers. PCR will be repeated at higher Tm.
PCR run:

2 KAN B0015 RS2                      F8         F2         3760
Notes
It was a touch-Down PCR
1 and 2 amplified and had right size. Only 1 will be purified because is more useful than 2.

Bands 6 and 8 were really faint but had the right size.

Band purification
Name PCR                              Concentration [ng/µl]
1 pBAD-ADF-3 9.7     6 LuxCDEG (sigEP)              5.6     8 LuxCDEG (pcaa3)              4.1     10 pcaa3 LuxCDEG - VB IntC 14.8     11 psigEP LuxCDEG – VB IntC 33.2     13 LuxAB (Xenor..lumins..)      6.1
Notes Parts 6 and 8 (LuxCDEG) will be used for a new PCR because they were very faint.
Gibson Isothermal Buffer
A new buffer was made because we realized the old one was prepared with wrong concentrations. New concentrations: MgCL2 2M, DTT 1M.
Gibson and transformation
C1.1: C4-Open+pSBAB+mRFP  (CK) C1.2: C4-Open+pSBA2+mRFP  (CK) Pcaa3 BB:  Pcaa3 BB + VB_Pcaa3  (C) ADF 3: ADF3 + (pBAD) VB_ADF3 (C)
Error:  mRFP was used for C1.2 instead of RFP (C1.2 is designed to work with RFP).
C4 Open: RS1+KAN+B0015+RS2
Colony PCR
C1.1 and C1.2 (assembly date 08.01): 20 colonies were selected from each plate. Right sized colonies: 5,6,7,8 and eleven from C1.1 and 11 from C1.2. Maybe colony 27 from C1.2. This Gibson assembly was repeated anyway. Colony 6 did not grow.
