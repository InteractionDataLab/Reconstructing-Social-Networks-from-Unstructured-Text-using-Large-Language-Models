Judging Criteria
We believe our team deserves the following medal:  ☐Bronze ☐Silver ☐Gold
Because we met the following criteria
Bronze:
✓ Team registration
☐ Complete Judging form
✓ Team Wiki
☐ Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
✓ At least one new submitted and well-characterized standard BioBrick Part or Device. A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts.
Silver:
In addition to the Bronze Medal requirements...
☐ Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected
☐ Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
Gold:
In addition to the Bronze and Silver Medal requirements, any one or more of the following:
☐ Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year) and enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), and don't forget to create a new registry page for the improved part.
☐ Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
☐ Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
