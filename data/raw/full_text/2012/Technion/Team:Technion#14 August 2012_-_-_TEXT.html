Ilya
- Gradient PCR of I0462 from F2620 failed. I need to design a different primer.
- Glycerol stock of pSB3C5. Freezer position is 4C.
- Minipreped the pSB3C5 and R0062+Fus1. Got very high concentrations of pSB3C5 in comparison to pSB1A2. This is not logical because pSB1A2 is a high copy plasmid and pSB3C5 is a low-medium copy plasmid. I wanted to change the backbone to a low copy plasmid Roee has in his lab, but Orna told me to continue with this backbone. I bet we will get bad results in the plate reader eventually again.
- Set restriction digest with XbaI and PstI of: pSB1C3+Fus2 (to get both, backbone and insert), R0062+Fus1 in pSB1A2 (to get the insert) and pSB3C5 (to get the backbone). After I got home, I realized that I should have digested with EcoRI and PstI instead of XbaI and PstI.

Cut xyIE insert with Xmal and XhoI ??

I had done digestion and purification of pPROLar again, in final step I had used mbH20 and not elution buffer provided with the kit. Also I had used a smaller volume of elution liquid in final step of purification - 25 ul and not 50 ul, like previous day. After purification I had got a slightly better concentration of the digested plasmid, about 13 ng/ul. I'll continue to work with it.
