During the past two days I was getting familiar with Vector NTI. I learned how to use the Vector NTI explorer and started adding parts to our library. Apparently the parts registry lets you download a GenBank file of each BioBrick. Once you open the file in Vector NTI you can save it to your database. I imported a few BioBricks this way. I also configured the database to be saved in our Dropbox. This way we can all use the same database.
While adding parts to our database I realized that I don't know which are the exact fluorescent proteins we chose. After doing some reading and recalling what Roee mentioned, I think we are going to use mCherry, mCitrine and Cerulean. Unfortunately, not all of these are available as BioBricks with an RBS and terminators. We will probably have to assemble these parts ourselves.
I also did some research about riboswitches. Apparently, another theophyllin riboswitch was created using directed evolution. The new riboswitch by Gallivan and Lynch has a 96 fold increase in translation once theophyllin is added to the system. If we get this effect in our system, it will be gre
