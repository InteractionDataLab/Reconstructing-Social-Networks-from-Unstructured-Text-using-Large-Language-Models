Ilya
Today we met and presented our review of the chose project. I had a long list of remarks which covered most of the problems. The devil is in the details and the devil and I are apparently good friends. Following our discussion we came up with a list of things that need to be done soon: 1) We need the genes for the three RNA polymerases: T7, T3 and SP6. 2) We need to find the exact lambda phage we want to order and its genome sequence (and restriction site map if available). It should be a strain that has minimal genome size while still capable of being lytic. 3) We need to choose an E. coli strain that can be shipped to us. The chosen E. coli should be responsive to the 3 sugars or we should use different 3 inputs. 4) I also suggested that we look into which genes we can replace in the lambda phage. Check the literature for the genes it needs in order to assemble except for the capsid genes.
Also, Hila and I volunteered to update the proposal with the different corrections that we discussed during the meeting.
