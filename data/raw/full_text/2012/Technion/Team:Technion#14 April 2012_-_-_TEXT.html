Ilya
I looked for biotech companies that might be interested in sponsoring our iGEM project. I contacted a lot of companies and they all told me to send them an email with details about our team. I hoped that at least one of them will send us an answer in a week or two but I was disappointed. Inbal, Noa, Hila and Rachel had more luck on their funding efforts. Also, Lior and Hila got us some money from a start up company in exchange for our commitment to use their software for our project.
