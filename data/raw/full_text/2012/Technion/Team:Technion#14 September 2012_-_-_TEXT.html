Ilya

-Coloeny PCR for 8 random picked colonies from In1 plates- but this time, I chenged the primers!, and surprise: I got 3 positive clones!!!
- I did a glycerol stock for native T3 RNAP with CM resistance.
-Miniprep for eT7+pSB1AK3: 509.5, 369 ng/ul.
-Miniprep for native T3+pSB1C3: 447.5, 363 ng/ul.
-Digestion of eT7+pSB1AK3 with EcoRI for 15 minutes at 37C- for verifing the clone for sure. After running the product on an agarose gel, I noticed an estimated 7Kb band- which is the expected one!
-Cip reaction for BBa_B015 at 37C for 1 hour. After the reaction, I noticed that the dry bath wasn't ON, so I trashed the sample. :[
- Restriction of T3 RNAP with XbaI and SpeI for 2 hours at 37C, but after running the products on a gel- I didn't get any suitable bands (the 2700bp band was missing!).
Asaf
Hila
- Additional PCR for fragments 1C and 6C, and for fragments F4, F4*, and F5.
- Gel purification for all of yesterday's PCR's (F4, F4*, F4', F5, 4C, 6C and 7C).
