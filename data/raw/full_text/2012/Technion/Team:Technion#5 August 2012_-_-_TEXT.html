- Minipreped clones R0062+RS+mCh+I0462 #1, #4, #8 and #12.
- Sent BBa_I0462 for sequencing (because the colony PCR gave negative results for all the clones.
- Restriction digest with HindIII to check if I0462 is really in there. Digested I0462 as a positive control and R0062+RS+mCh as a negative control.
- Ran the products on a gel but forgot to load the uncut plasmids. The results are worthless. Although, it seems that the I0462 which was supposed to be cut, wasn't cut. The day after tomorrow we will receive the sequence and know what's going on. I will repeat the restriction check tomorrow.
- We met today and dividing the different tasks up ahead between us. I will finish the clone with I0462 and do plate reader assays for the tac+RS+mCh and the R0062+RS+mCh+I0462 once I finish it.
