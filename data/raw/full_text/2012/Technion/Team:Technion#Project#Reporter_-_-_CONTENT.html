Before we can test  them together, we have to make sure that our parts work individually. For that  purpose, we allocated two team members to create assays that can test the  function of our <EM>E. coli</EM> parts, the inducible RNA polymerases, and  characterize them. 
The  cassettes that are used in the plasmids are shown in <STRONG><EM>Figure 1.</EM></STRONG></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Work_plan">Work plan</SPAN></H2><P>We intend to  create two colored assays that can indicate and quantify the expression of the  different polymerases from our plasmids. Each assay gene will be cloned after  each of the RNA polymerase promoters, so that the expression of the polymerases  will be linked to the color developed. Before using them with the designated  RNA polymerase plasmid, we intend to characterize them by using different  inducer concentrations and measuring the absorbance.
  Main Parts:</P><OL><LI><STRONG>Alkaline Phosphatase Assay</STRONG>: In <EM>E.  coli</EM>, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is encoded by the <EM>phoA</EM> gene. The wild  type <EM>phoA</EM> gene from Citrobacter has a signal sequence directing export  of alkaline phosphatase into the periplasm, where it is active. In this  protocol, the colorless substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) is hydrolyzed  by ALP, producing nitrophenol, a yellow color product, which is quantified by  an assay at a maximum absorbance 420 nm.</LI><LI><STRONG><EM>xylE</EM></STRONG><STRONG> Assay:</STRONG> The xylE  gene from <EM>Pseudomonas putida</EM> TOL  pWW0. This gene encodes the enzyme catechol-2,3-dioxygenase  (metapyrocatechase), which converts catechol to the bright yellow product  2-hydroxy-cis,cis-muconic semialdehyde. This is a useful reporter gene;  colonies or broths expressing active XylE, in the presence of oxygen, will  rapidly convert catechol, a cheap colorless substrate, to a bright yellow compound  with an absorbance maximum around 380 nm. </LI><LI><STRONG>Promoters: </STRONG>In order to  check as many different polymerases to see with which set of enzymes we achieve  minimum cross-reactivity, we worked with 5 polymerases. Both the polymerases  and their matching promoters were acquired from Christopher A. Voigt1.  He sent us the four RNA polymerases promoters: pT7*,p T3, pK1F, and pN4 with a  T7 terminator at the end.These four plasmids will also function as our  backbone plasmids, and to them we'll clone the assay genes along with their  RBS. The Sp6 promoter was added via PCR over the T7 promoter.</LI><LI><STRONG>Controls: </STRONG></LI><OL><LI><U>Positive</U>- In order to see whether our assay's genes, <EM>phoA</EM> and <EM>xylE</EM>, work properly and generate a colored output, we created a  positive control. The positive control will consist of a Tetracycline  repressible promoter (pTetO) before each of the assay's genes. In the absence of an inducer, TetR binds to tetO  and prevents transcription. It can be turned on when an inducer, such as  tetracycline, binds to TetR and causes a conformation change that prevents TetR  from remaining bound to the operator. <DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><STRONG><EM>Figure 2: </EM></STRONG><EM>an illustration of the pET system as designed originally [A] and our own  pET as used in our experiment [B]</EM></DIV></DIV></DIV>
When the operator site is not bound, the  activity of the promoter is restored. Unfortunately,  we don't have a bacterium strain with the repressor we plan to use the pTetO as  a constitutive promoter.</LI><LI><U>Negative</U>: We have two kinds of negative controls: The  first one is to see whether we get any absorbance without the presence of the  assay parts, promoter + assay gene. The second one is to measure the leakage of  the polymerase promoters. For that reason, we will measure the absorbance of  the promoter plasmids without the polymerase genes. </LI></OL><LI><STRONG>pET Expression System: </STRONG>In order to  characterize our assay, we intend to use the pET expression system. The host  cell for the pET expression system is a bacteria which has been genetically  engineered to incorporate the gene for T7 RNA polymerase, the lac promoter and  the lac operator in its genome (BL21 strain). When lactose or a molecule  similar to lactose is present inside the cell, transcription of the T7 RNA  polymerase is activated.Therefore, we have a similar system to the T7  RNA polymerase plasmid that we intended to create in the first place. By  transformation of our pT7 test plasmid to the engineered bacteria with the  endogenous T7 polymerase gene, we can characterize our pT7 test plasmid. By adding  rising concentrations of the inducer, IPTG, and measuring the absorbance for  each one, we can deduce whether we have a rising concentration of our assay  genes, <EM>phoA</EM> and <EM>xylE</EM>. However, this only works in bulk or culture  assay and not single cell assays, since in single cells the lac system is  on/off. Meaning that at low concentrations of IPTG some cells will turn on,  while the rest will be off. An illustration of the normal pET system and our  &quot;made&quot; system is shown in <STRONG><EM>Figure 2</EM></STRONG>.</LI></OL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Results">Results</SPAN></H2><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_Assay_Genes">The Assay Genes</SPAN></H3><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:252px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><STRONG><EM>Figure 3</EM></STRONG><EM>: gel electrophoresis for the PCR results of all the promoter backbone  plasmids.

We added XhoI and XmaI restriction sites in  both ends of the parts via PCR, for the <EM>phoA</EM> gene we also added an RBS  (BBa_B0064).

In order to have a fifth plasmid with  the SP6 promoter2 we performed another PCR, only with different  primers: we engineered primers that had the Sp6 promoter in them while the  template was an pT7 plasmid. This way, the T7 promoter was replaced with the  Sp6 promoter. In all of the reactions described above, we added XhoI and XmaI  restriction sites in both ends of the plasmids. 
  As  shown in <STRONG><EM>Figure 3</EM></STRONG> we managed to get all the backbones in the  right size.

In terms of the Trojan Phage,  that can create a situation that even if there are no activators present in the  cell, the leakage of the polymerase promoters can create enough polymerases to  translate the phage's proteins and cause lysis. </LI><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Best_BioBrick_Measurement_Approach:">Best BioBrick Measurement Approach:</SPAN></H2><P>We have developed an assay that can be used to test the activity of the T7 polymerase, or any polymerase, by using any of the similar plasmids that we have made or by simply replacing the promoter using Xbal and XhoI restriction enzymes. 
However, it can also act as a reporter system for the production of any part by a simple cloning step: first extracting the RBS+xylE / RBS+ALP part via XhoI and XmaI and inserting it into any plasmid that holds a desired gene. By performing the assay, one can measure the amount of the part translated according to the intensity of the color. It can be used instead of a fluorescent gene or as an addition to one. 

Moreover, combined with the pET system, or one of our polymerase plasmids, the systems can be used as an inducible production systems for any Biobrick, that can also measure  the amount produced. In order to use it in this manner, one has to insert the required part with an RBS after the T7 promoter via XhoI, transfer it to a bacteria with the standard pET system, and add the desired amount of inducer, IPTG, according to the graph presented in the experience part in the registry. The result is an inducible system in which the user can choose the production amount of any chosen Biobrick and verify it by the colored assay.

If by simply adding another measurement option, as an alternative to fluorescent genes, or by creating an inducible measurable production system, we have created an important, easy- to- use Biobricks  that can be used as measurement systems in a wide range of applications.
