- This morning I came up with a few improvements for our strategy for dividing the phage into workable fragments. I presented them to Hila, who also did some research and we presented everything to Roee. Looks like this idea might actually work.
- We had a group meeting, in which we all presented what we are planing to do.
- I did some preparation for the plate reader experiment tomorrow. Prepared BA and theiphylline stocks. Planned the dilutions and the detailed protocol.
- Put a 5ml starter of pSB1C3+Fus2 for the plate reader tomorrow.
- Put a 10ml starter of pSB1A2+F2620 for minipreps tomorrow.

I have started on the project of fusing the RiboSwitch with the different RNA polymerases.
Today I have made a starter of Puc19 12.1 with the Riboswitch from the glycerol stock.

- yea! the bacteria containing the biobrick grew on the LB+Amp plate and today i have taken 5 ml for the starters.
- after consulting with Roee me and Noa decided that we need one more approach for the test plasmids: using xyIE reporter gene from the distribution kit so i did transformation to TopTenRB compotent cells and plated 100 and 200 ul on an Amp plate.
