Ilya
Today I measured the concentrations of the miniprep of pSB1A2+R0062 (the pLux promoter). I minipreped two starters and at the end, I repeated the elution stage into a new ependorf for each sample. The concentrations and volumes we have now are: 1a: 130.5 ng/ul in 28 ul 1b: 137.0 ng/ul in 26 ul 2a: 70.0 ng/ul in 28 ul 2b: 69.5 ng/ul in 28 ul I also took some of the stuff sigma sent us from Sharon. We also got our new set of primers. I diluted them and ran the first set of PCR reactions to generate the two fragments for the fusion PCR. I used Tm=65 and elongation time of 30 secs. I will continue working on the fusion on Monday after my first exam. Finally, I demonstrated to the group how to document their work on the wiki during our weekly meeting.
