Ilya
Today we began working on the first set of PCR reactions. It includes amplifying the gene for mCherry and the riboswitch with primers that will create an overlapping segment between the two. We diluted the primers, planned the PCR program, calculated the volume of the reaction contents, diluted the template and set up the PCR reactions. Eventually we left the PCR to work and tomorrow the resulting solution will be moved to the freezer. On Sunday we will hopefully run a gel to verify that we have the correct amplification products. The size of the mCherry gene is 737bp (including the riboswitch overlap). The size of the segment which includes the riboswitch is 549 bp (including the mCherry overlap). After the gel we will clean our PCR products, measure their concentration and plan the fusion PCR reaction.
On another note, I am responsible on making the stock solutions for next week. We decided to have a weekly duty on replacing stock solutions and I volunteered to go first.
We also decided to print our protocols in detail and have them in the lab. I wrote the protocol for diluting the primers and will work on the protocol for setting up the PCR reactions.
