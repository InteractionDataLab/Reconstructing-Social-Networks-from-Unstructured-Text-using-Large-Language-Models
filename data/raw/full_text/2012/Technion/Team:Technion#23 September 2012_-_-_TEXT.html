There are colonies in the plates! YU HU!
I stored the plates at 4C.
- colont PCR for the colonies which contain "pTetO+mCherry within pSB1C3"- I found a positive colony and did to it a starter for sending the plasmid to the registry!
- the other plates (those with pTetO+mCherry+T7* RNAP and pTetO+mCherry+T3 RNAP within pSB1AK3 plasmids) were stored at 4C..  on Thursday I will scan the plates for positives clones!

-I did a colony PCR for 6 clones of each transformed Psb1c3+prefix+RS+differnt polymerase+suffix (total 24).
-I also did a streap plate for each of the clones.
-After several hours I also made starters from each streap in the streap plate.

Gibson assembly first attempt for more than two fragments.
I tried to reassemble F4+F5+F6, F5+F6+F7, and F4+F5+F6+F7. The results show the reassemble of two fragments, and low efficiency of three and four fragments reassembly.
This reaction will be tested again tomorrow using three fragments only.

tried to amplify parts fragments 1, 2, 3 & 8.
part 3 did not work at all. part one - still a very low concentration.  parts 2 & 8 are with high concentration, and can be used for gibson assmbely.
