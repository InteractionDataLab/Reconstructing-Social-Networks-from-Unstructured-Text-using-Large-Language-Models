They consist of a short mRNA sequence that can  fold to create a structure. This structure can be changed in the presence of a  specific ligand. The regulatory function is achieved if the mRNA structural  change can determine if a gene will be translated. In bacteria this can be done  by placing the riboswitch before a RBS and ensuring that it will block the ribosome  from the RBS, and that after the ligand is added the structural change will  allow the ribosome access to the RBS. It is important to note that the function of the  RS can be affected by the coding region downstream to it {1,2}.

This  technique allows fusing together any two DNA pieces in a precise way, and  without having to rely on restriction sites. This is accomplished by careful  planning of primes so that for each DNA piece there are 2 primers: in the fused  area the primer has a complementary area for the DNA piece and also a  complementary area for the second DNA piece; normal primer for the non-fused  end {3}.
The first step is to elongate each of the DNA pieces so that each will contain  a complementary region for the other DNA piece. This is done by normal PCR {3}.</P><P align="left">The second step is to elongate both DNA  pieces in the same PCR reaction using only the outer primers. This way the  overlapping region of the DNA pieces will act as a third primer, resulting in  fused product that contains both DNA pieces {3}. </P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="General_design">General design</SPAN></H2><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><STRONG><EM>Figure 3:</EM></STRONG><EM>summary of our  fusion PCR strategy.</EM></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>We used a synthetic theophylline riboswitch,  clone 12.1, that was created by S.A Lynch and J.P Gallivan{1}.
  We chose to use this kind of regulatory  element for the following reasons:</P><OL><LI>In  our project we are using several different regulatory elements and we need them  to work together with little or none crosstalk. Most of the regulatory elements  are inducible promoters. We had a hard time finding more inducible promoters  that are well defined and don’t crosstalk with the rest of our promoters. So we  looked for another kind of regulatory element.</LI><LI>Riboswitches  were discovered only in 2002, and the synthetic ones were created not long  after.</LI><LI>Riboswitches  can be useful to future iGEM teams and the rest of the synthetic biology  community as an additional and unique regulatory element. </LI></OL><DIV class="thumb tleft"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><STRONG><EM>Figure 2:</EM></STRONG><EM> Riboswitch  with RNA polymerase or mCherry cassette.</EM></DIV></DIV></DIV><P align="left">In our project we use Riboswitches with a reporter  gene (mCherry) and RNA polymerases: T7, T7*, SP6, T7*(T3),T7*( K1F), T7*(N4)  (later notated as T3, K1F and N4){4}. 
In order to combine the riboswitch with the  different genes we use fusion PCR. We use it because in order for the  riboswitch to work the start codon of the gene should be adjacent and  downstream to the RBS. This is due to the start codon part in the specific  riboswitch structure. 
The  cassettes that are used in the plasmids are shown in <STRONG><EM>Figure 2.</EM></STRONG></P><P>The  Riboswitch is very short (74 bp including the RBS) and it could be a problem  with PCR, so we’ve extracted it with 430 bp upstream (part of the pUC19  plasmid) and the long Riboswitch is then 504 bp long. Moreover, the added part  from pUC19 contains an MCS (which contains an EcoRI site) and a tac promoter.  By adding a PstI site to the end of the RNAP polymerases or mCherry (by carefully  planning the primer) we could clone the fusion product into pSB1C3. 
The summary  of our fusion PCR strategy is presented in <STRONG><EM>Figure 3</EM></STRONG>.

The resulting construct was used in a plate  reader assay to measure the level of fluorescence as a function of theophylline  concentration. After consulting with Dennis Mishler from the Gallivan lab, we learned  that full induction of translation should occur at 2mM of theophylline. Thus,  we planned a dose response experiment with concentration ranging from 0-8mM  theophylline. Several experiments were done, as described in the results  section of this page.
During the second set of experiments, a  negative and a positive control were introduced. The negative control is pSB1C3  with an MCS insert. The positive control is a plasmid in which the RS was  deleted and replaced with a spacer region with the RBS from the riboswitch.
  All plate reader experiments were done in <EM>E.  coli </EM>TOP10 strain. Briefly, starters were grown over night, diluted 1:100,  grown to ~O.D 0.6 and divided into 48 well plates. IPTG was added (to 1mM  concentration) to induce the tac promoter and different concentrations of  theophylline were added. Controls without IPTG and without theophylline were  prepared as well. The samples were incubated at 37 degrees for ~3-4.5 hours  before measuring fluorescence in the plate reader.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_positive_control">The positive control</SPAN></H3><P>The positive control was constructed by doing  a PCR reaction to amplify a plasmid with MCS+tac+RS+mCherry without the RS  part. The primers were designed with tails which created a spacer region and a  PacI restriction site upstream to the RBS from the RS. The PCR products were  digested with PacI and self ligated to produce the positive control plasmids.  This process was done on several constructs in parallel in order to save time.  Some of the constructs contained mutations in the spacer region which should be  affecting the RBS strength. Thus, we disregard those differences in the spacer  region when looking at our results.
The spacer region was planned using <A href="http://www.nupack.org/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">NUPACK</A>to create minimal secondary structures  around the RBS. Moreover, NUPACK was used in order to compare secondary  structures of the RS in fusion to different proteins.

The intermediate conclusion at this stage was  that the mCherry might be accumulating in the cell due to the high copy number  of the plasmid. Since the TOP10 strain has only low level of lacI, the  transcription from the tac promoter occurs continuously. Therefore, the basal  translation level is enough for the mCherry to accumulate.</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Second_set_of_experiments">Second set of experiments</SPAN></H4><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><STRONG><EM>Figure 5:</EM></STRONG><EM>mCherry fluorescence divided by culture  O.D as a function of theophylline concentration after induction by IPTG.

However, the positive control in pSB1C3 gives ~1.5  lower result than the RS results. It should be noted that there is a slight  difference in the sequence of the positive controls in the spacer region, due to  mutations during the cloning process.
While working with the pSB3C5 backbone we  noticed that it gave higher miniprep results than pSB1C3 which made us suspect  that it is not low copy. Therefore, we decided to repeat the experiment in a  verified low copy backbone from Roee, which was notated pCP.</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Third_set_of_experimetns">Third set of experimetns</SPAN></H4><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><STRONG><EM>Figure 6:</EM></STRONG><EM>mCherry fluorescence divided by culture  O.D as a function of theophylline concentration after induction by IPTG.

Firstly, the riboswitch does not respond to changes in theophylline concentration. Secondly, high levels of fluorescence indicate that translation occurs in the absence of theophylline. Thirdly, the positive control seems to malfunction, giving lower results than the riboswitch (except for the experiment in pSB3C5). On the other hand, there might be some effect of the surrounding sequences on the RBS strength. Finally, the plasmid copy number did not have a significant effect on the results.</P><P>Taking all of the above observations into account, we believe that the main reason for the riboswitch failure is due to an effect of the coding region of mCherry on the riboswitch function. A modeling effort has been made to support this assumption using <A href="http://www.nupack.org/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">NUPACK</A> secondary structure prediction and the <A href="https://salis.psu.edu/software/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Salis lab RBS calculator</A>.

<UL><LI>To  make sure that our experimental setup is correct, we could repeat the  experiment done by Lynch and Gallivan {1} with the  riboswitch fused to IS10+lacZ (IS10 is a coding region upstream to lacZ). </LI><LI>If the  experimental setup is good, we can attempt fusing the RS to a variety of  different fluorescent proteins. Moreover, we could fuse the fluorescent  proteins to the IS10 coding region instead of to the RS. This way the mRNA in  close proximity downstream to the riboswitch will be identical to a system that  has already been shown to work. </LI><LI>We could fuse the  RS to fluorescent proteins with degradation tags, thus eliminating the  possibility of accumulation of the fluorescent protein. </LI><LI>We could repeat  the experiment in an <EM>E. coli</EM> strain with high levels of lacI, thus ensuring  that there is no transcription before the induction of the system. </LI></UL></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="RS_with_polymerases">RS with polymerases</SPAN></H3><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><STRONG><EM>Figure 7:</EM></STRONG><EM>gel </EM><EM>electrophoresis</EM><EM> for the fusion PCR between Riboswitch and different polymerases.</EM></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>We have been trying to fuse the Riboswitch  with different RNA polymerases (2775bp). We started with the polymerases: T7,  T7* (different from T7), T3, N4, K1F, SP6. After a lot of work on SP6 Inbal  found out that we have not been working with the SP6, so we’ve dropped it from  a lack of time.
After several failed fusion PCR attempts we  figured out that the right Tm was 55-56°C for all  but K1F whose Tm was 55-57°C.
