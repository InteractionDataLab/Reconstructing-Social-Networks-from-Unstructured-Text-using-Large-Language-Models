- Made glycerol stock from the starters. Fus1_#1 is in 3B, Fus2_#7 is in 4B, Fus2_#11 is in 5B.
- Minipreped the rest of the starter. Each starter was divided into two miniperep reactions. The final concentrations were (in ng/μl): 1a - 196.5, 1b - 155.5, 7a - 132, 7b - 148, 11a - 135, 11b - 155.
- Samples 1B, 7a and 11a were prepared for sequencing with primers upstream and downstream to the insert. They will be sent tomorrow.
- Restriction digest of R0062 and J23119 with SpeI and PstI. Restriction digest of pSB1C3+Fus1 with XbaI and PstI to obtain Fus1 for cloning downstream to R0062 and J23119. Restriction digest of pSB1C3+Fus1 with EcoRi and PstI to obtain the pSB1C3 backbone for future cloning reactions. The restriction reactions were left in the dry bath with a program for 2 hours restrction at 37 degrees, 20 mins heat inactivation at 80 degrees and hold at 4 degrees.
