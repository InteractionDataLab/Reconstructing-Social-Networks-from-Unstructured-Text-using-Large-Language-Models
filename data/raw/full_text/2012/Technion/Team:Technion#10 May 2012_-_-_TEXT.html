Ilya
During the past week we were planing all of our cloning steps. We decided on the order of the cloning steps, designed primers, learned about 3A assembly, designed the fusion PCR primers and planned some of the controls we will need. Yesterday we all met to talk about each group's progress. We did all of our tasks but we didn't prepare a good way of presenting our accomplishments to the rest of the group. Eventually we managed to explain the main steps of our plan. Note to self - when in doubt, always prepare a presentation! During the meeting we also discussed a problem regarding the registry standards. One of our genes has 4 EcoRI sites and an SpeI site. All the BioBricks that we will create with that gene won't be compatible with any standard.
