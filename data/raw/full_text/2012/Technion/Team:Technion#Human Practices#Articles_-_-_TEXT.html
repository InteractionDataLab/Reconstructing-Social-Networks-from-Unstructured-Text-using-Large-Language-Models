From Factor
"Factor" is a local magazine distributed inside the Technion. During the interview we had told the journalists about synthetic biology, iGEM competition and our project. We hope that such publication can raise awareness about synthetic biology and iGEM among the students, so next year more students will join this unique experience.
Sadly the article itself in Hebrew, so it pretty much limits the audience that can understand it outside Israel...
