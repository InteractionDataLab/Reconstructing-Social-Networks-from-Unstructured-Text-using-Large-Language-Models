In 2006, he moved to Caltech, where he specialized in Synthetic Biology working as a post-doctoral scholar in collaboration with Prof. Scott Fraser, Frances Arnold, and Rob Phillips. In 2011, Dr Amit returned to Israel with a Senior Lecturer (Assistant Professor) appointment to start the Technion's first Synthetic Biology research lab. Dr Amit's group is focused on constructing &quot;Synthetic Enhancer Circuits&quot; for a variety of applications and research objectives. The group's primary purpose is to decipher basic enhancer design principles using a variety of microscopy, molecular engineering, and theoretical approaches, including new synthetic biology tools developed in the lab.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD style="border: 2px outset orange;"><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Dr. Orna Attar</B></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD><TD style="border: 2px inset orange;"><P>Orna Atar is the lab manager in the synthetic biology laboratory of Prof. Roee Amit at the department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering, Technion, Haifa, Israel.</P><P>Orna received her Bachelor’s degree (1999) in life sciences from Tel Aviv University and her Master’s degree (2005) in the Interdisciplinary Program for Biotechnology in the Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering from the Technion, Haifa.

Like Ilya I've heard about synthetic biology as part of a lecture in a molecular biotechnology course. I was thrilled about the possibilities that synthetic biology openes before researches and when I had a chance to participate in such a research myself as a part of iGEM experience, I said &quot;yes&quot; without hesitation.</P><P> By participating in iGEM competition I see a chance to gain valuable experience in the field that can help me a lot during my M. Sc. studies in the future. Though I don't have much experience in research, I hope to help our team as much as I can and become valuable team member.</P><P> On my spare time I like read books, watch movies and play video games.

I'm in the end of my third year in the faculty of Biotechnology and Food engineering. I was first introduced to synthetic biology by my friend Hila, who is also on the team. She suggested I join the iGEM competition and take a part in a unique experience - of course I was enthusiastic. During the last semester, I've learnt synthetic biology profoundly - and loved it. I was inspired by it and thought about different issues we encounter during our lives and how synthetic biology could be a great solution for them.</P><P>In my spare time, I love spending time with my boyfriend, friends and family. My hobbies are riding the bicycle and watching comedy shows like Friends, The big bang theory, How I met your mother etc.</P><P>During this adventure I hope to obtain laboratory skills and understand synthetic biology, but mainly have fun and a great time.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD style="border: 2px outset #68DEFF;"><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:202px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Noa Katz</B></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD><TD style="border: 2px inset #68DEFF;"><P>I am a third year student at the Faculty of Biotechonology and Food Engineering in the Technion. The first time I had heard about Synthetic Biology was when I received an invitation to participate in the competition. I believe that a field that combines the enormous knowledge we have gained in the field of molecular biology with the approach and technicality that the field of Engineering has to offer, allows us to obtain much greater achievements than with those two fields studied separately.</P><P> iGEM had appealed to me greatly since both the research idea and its execution is made by us - first degree students. I thank iGEM for the opportunity to be a part of something that is so close to the real world, in terms of research, lab work and problem solving.</P><P>Apart from my educational interests, I like to play chess, meet with friends, and play computer games.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD style="border: 2px outset #2B60FF;"><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:101px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Rachel Lev</B></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD><TD style="border: 2px inset #2B60FF;"><P> I'm a senior year student in the Faculty of Biotechnology &amp; Food Engineering in the Technion.</P><P>I first heard about synthetic biology during molecular biology course.
