Ilya
At first, the group suggested buying the lambda phage from Sigma. However, after I took a look at their catalog, I found that they don't have the phage we need. So I began searching for a lambda phage with a minimal genome size which maintains the lytic cycle. We needed a strain that will be available commercially and will be easy to work with. I eventually found a lecture discussing different vectors which also included lambda vectors. In the lecture, the lambda fix cloning vector was mentioned. From there, it was easy to find the actual product. It seems that Lambda FIX II from Agilent Technologies will be able to answer our needs. As a bonus, the full kit comes with a manual which includes some of the protocols we will probably need. Here is the link: http://www.chem.agilent.com/en-US/Search/Library/_layouts/Agilent/PublicationSummary.aspx?whid=72697&liid=6482
