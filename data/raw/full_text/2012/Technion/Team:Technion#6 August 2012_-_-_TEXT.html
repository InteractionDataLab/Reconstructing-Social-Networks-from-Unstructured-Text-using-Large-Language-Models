Ilya
- Repeated restriction digest with HindIII for R0062+RS+mCh+I0462 #1, #4, #8 and #12 clones. Digested I0462 as a positive control and R0062+RS+mCh as a negative control. Ran all products on a gel and didn't forget to load the uncut plasmids this time. All the samples were uncut. Seems like the original I0462 BioBrick is not what we think it is. The sequencing results tomorrow will tell us more.
- Since I expect that I0462 is not really what we expect it to be, I did transformation of BBa F2620. This BioBrick is a composite part which includes I0462. It was sequence verified by the registry (unlike I0462) and shown to work. If the sequencing results confirm that I0462 is not what we think it is, we will order primers to PCR I0462 from F2620.
- Began preparing for the plate reader assay which I will run on Wednesday.
- Came up with an idea for how to manipulate the phage genome. I presented it to Hila and we both presented it to Roee, who said it's a good idea. The idea is to break down the phage genome into defined fragments using PCR and clone them into plasmids. In the plasmids, we can manipulate them using PCR and standard cloning methods. To assemble the complete phage genome after the manipulations, we will use Gibson assembly.
