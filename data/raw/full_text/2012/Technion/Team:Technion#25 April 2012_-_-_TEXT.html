Ilya
Inbal, Asaf and I met with Roee today to talk about our sub-project. We presented to him the idea of combining the pLux promoter with a theophyllin riboswitch to reduce the basal levels. We discussed the system design and figured out that during the next two weeks we will plan all the cloning stages in detail, to construct our complete plasmid. The final insert should include a pLux promoter, riboswitch with rbs, fluorescent protein, riboswitch with rbs, T3 RNA polymerase, rbs, luxR and terminators. Since the riboswitch and rbs need to be fused to the genes that follow them without a ligation scar, we will need to use PCR to assemble the riboswitch-rbs-gene parts. During the next few days we will learn how to use Vector NTI to plan our cloning steps. We will need to design the primers, restriction sites and sequence of cloning steps. Good luck to us!
