Consequentially, a fluorescent protein and an <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Technion/Project/RNAPs" class="external text" rel="nofollow">RNA polymerase</A> are produced. The general scheme of a YES gate is presented in <STRONG><EM>Figure 1.</EM></STRONG></P><P>When planing a complex system, there is no way of knowing which combination of promoter and <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Technion/Project/RNAPs" class="external text" rel="nofollow">RNAP</A> will work well. Therefore, we planned to attempt the cloning of different <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Technion/Project/RNAPs" class="external text" rel="nofollow">RNAPs</A> under the various promoters.
The choice of FPs to follow each promoter was not random. The different considerations will be described below.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="YES_gate_.231">YES gate #1</SPAN></H2><P>The first YES gate consists of a P<SUB>TetO</SUB> promoter which is repressed by <I>Tet</I>R. The expression is induced by anhydrotetracycline (aTc). At first, we attempted the cloning of mCitrine downstream to P<SUB>TetO</SUB> in plasmids we got from Roee. These showed no fluorescence when tested in the plate reader. Therefore, we turned to the registry for alternatives. We found <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I13522" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_I13522</A> and <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I13600" class="external text" rel="nofollow">I13600</A> which express P<SUB>TetO</SUB>+GFP and P<SUB>TetO</SUB>+CFP respectively. Restriction analysis of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I13522" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_I13522</A> gave us some weird results, so we decided not to use it. Eventually, we decided to use a P<SUB>TetO</SUB>+mCherry from Roee, which he is working with regularly.
The next step was cloning the different RNAPs downstream to mCherry. Unfortunately, we didn't get a working clone with any of the RNAPs in time for the BioBrick submission deadline.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="YES_gate_.232">YES gate #2</SPAN></H2><P>The second YES gate consists of P<SUB>Lac/Ara</SUB> promoter which is induced by IPTG and arabinose in the presence of <I>Lac</I>R and AraC respectively. We got this promoter from Roee followed by the Cerulean gene. This plasmid was used as the starting point for the assembly of YES gate #2. The first step was the addition of a <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_B0015" class="external text" rel="nofollow">terminator BioBrick</A> along with additional restriction sites for the cloning of different RNAPs. However, this cloning step kept failing in several attempts and was abandoned due to lack of time.
</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:602px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><I><B>Figure 2.</B></I><I>A schematic represantation of YES gates #1 and #2</I></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="YES_gate_.233">YES gate #3</SPAN></H2><P>The third YES gate consists of the P<SUB>Lux</SUB> promoter and a <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Technion/Project/RS" class="external text" rel="nofollow">theophylline induced riboswitch (RS)</A>. In this YES gate, there is actually a two step regulation. The transcription from the P<SUB>Lux</SUB> promoter is induced by <A href="http://partsregistry.org/3OC6HSL" class="external text" rel="nofollow">3OC<SUB>6</SUB>HSL</A>. The translation is regulated by the RS and is induced by theophylline.
The RS was originally developed in fusion to DsRed Express {1}, which is a red FP from which mCherry was engineered {2}. Since the coding region has effect on the RS function, we thought mCherry (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J06504" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_J06504</A>) would be a good candidate. However, the well that was supposed to contain <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J06504" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_J06504</A> contained some other DNA. As a result, we used PCR to get mCherry from <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J06702" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_J06702</A>. Unfortunately, using mCherry turned out to be a bad choice, since the regulation by the riboswitch failed. The chronicles of the cloning and experimentation with the RS are described in the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Technion/Project/RS" class="external text" rel="nofollow">RS</A> section.
Since the RS regulates the translation of a protein that is fused downstream to it, it had to be fused not only to the FP but also to the RNAPs. This step was completed successfully for several RNAPs as described in the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Technion/Project/RS" class="external text" rel="nofollow">RS</A> section. However, due to lack of time, we didn't manage to clone the RNAPs downstream to the mCherry in the composite part.
Finally, for this YES gate to work, the P<SUB>Lux</SUB> promoter requires the presence of the LuxR protein. We planned to clone <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I0462" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_I0462</A> which includes an RBS, the <I>LuxR</I> gene and a terminator downstream to our RNAP (or downstream to mCherry for intermediate testing) as the final part in the assembled YES gate. However, in the 2012 distribution kit, <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I0462" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_I0462</A> turned out to contain DNA that does not match the expected sequence (wasting valuable time for us). Consequentially, we tried to amplify <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I0462" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_I0462</A> from [partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_F2620 BBa_F2620]. The PCR failed since the primer tail contained the BioBrick RFC10 suffix, resulting in a primer that annealed to the suffix in the plasmid instead of the end of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_I0462" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_I0462</A>. Eventually, due to lack of time, we dropped the attempts of assembling the complete YES gate and focused on characterizing the RS as described in the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Technion/Project/RS" class="external text" rel="nofollow">RS</A> section.
