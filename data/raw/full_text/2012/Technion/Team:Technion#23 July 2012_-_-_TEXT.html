Ilya
- The ligations and transformations worked. The yield was very small but we still got a few colonies on the plates that were plated with the rest of the cells (after centrifugation).
- Did colony PCR reactions on 3 colonies from Fus1 HF, 3 colonies from Fus1 GC and 6 colonies of Fus2.
- Only 1 colony of Fus1 gave positive results (#1) and 4 colonies of Fus2 gave positive results (#7, #9, #10, #11).
- Put starters 10 ml each of the only positive colony of Fus1 and two positive colonies of Fus2 (#7 and #11). I also left the plate with the isolated colonies in the 37 incubator to grow some more. Hopefully, tomorrow we can miniprep the plasmids and send them for sequencing.
