Ilya
- Worked a bit more on the wiki design.
- Worked on the RBS calculator results for the riboswitch.
Inbal
Today I made 6 starters: 3 of them is the whole part (In1) and the rest is T3 RNAP (within pSB1C3) from our glycerol stock.
I also cleaned by a kit the cip reaction from the Sep 15. The concentration is 66ng/ul.
Asaf
I ran the restriction fragments I got from cutting the differnet inserts on gel.
I got the 3 kb band I expected and cut it from the gel and cleaned it.
Hila
- PCR for F3 with 400bp overlap, this fragment will use in the three fragments Gibson assembly.
Lior
Noa
Evgeni
Shahar
Rachel
Transformation after ligation of K1F+ter, T3+ter, N4+ter (within pSB1AK3 plasmid) and control (plasmid after cip treatment)to the TOP10 component cells on AMP antibiotics plates.
