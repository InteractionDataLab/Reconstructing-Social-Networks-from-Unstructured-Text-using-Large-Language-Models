Ilya
Today I ran the PCR products of the fragments for the fusion on a gel. They seemed mostly clean but since Roee suspected they weren't he told me to gel purify them. I ran the full volume of the PCR products on a fresh gel and then it was visible how many byproducts there were. I cut out the relevant bands and will purify them from the gel tomorrow. I also stumbled on an article that might be useful. It describes the synthesis of four orthogonal RNA polymerases. It also shows that the phage polymerases needed to be manipulated to reduce toxicity. I think we should consider asking the authors for the genes and promoters used in their work.
