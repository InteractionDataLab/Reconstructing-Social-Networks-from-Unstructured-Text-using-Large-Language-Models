The idea is to replace one phage protein location in the genome, under a new  regulatory promoter. This will allow the phage lytic cycle only in inducible  conditions, controlled by the engineered plasmids that express RNA-polymerases. 
This  project included planning the genetic manipulation of the phage genome. This  includes:</P><UL><LI>Phage deviation into fragments that will ease  the genetic manipulation, and re-factoring of the phages genome, after cutting  it into fragments.</LI><LI>Planning of the Q gene deletion and  re-insertion under the desirable regulation, the RNA-polymerase promoter.</LI><LI>The design of the antibiotic resistance gene  insertion into the phage genome, in order to create additional selection to  bacteria that contain the phage lysogenic genome.</LI></UL><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_chosen_phage_lambda_strain">The  chosen phage lambda strain</SPAN></H2><P>The phage that was chosen as our working tool  was phage lambda heat – inducible <EM>cI857s7</EM>. The phage genome contains  four mutations:</P><UL><LI>Addition of HindIII restriction site at 37,589  (C -&gt; T)  [ind1].</LI><LI>Mutated S gene at 45,352 (G -&gt; A),  which leads to accumulation of infectious bacteriophage in the <EM>E. coli</EM> cells, the phage concentration increase when released from the cell [Sam7]. </LI><LI>Temperature sensitive mutation that converts  the CI gene into a thermo sensitive protein. This allows inducing the lysogenic  phage cycle in 37˚C, and lysis induction in 42˚C, this mutation is  created at 37,742 (C -&gt; T)  [cI857].</LI><LI>Additional point mutation at 43,082 (G -&gt; A).</LI></UL><P dir="ltr">The  phage genome sequence was taken from <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_001416.1" class="external text" rel="nofollow">NCBI</A>

  We chose  to work with this phage mainly because of the temperature sensitivity, and the  ability to induce lysis in controlled conditions. Moreover, the phage  concentration will be higher when the bacterial cell undergoes lysis, due to  the Sam7 mutation. </P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_division_into_fragments">The division into fragments</SPAN></H2><P>When thinking on how to manipulate the phage genome and insert one or  more genes under desire regulation (like RNA-pol promoters in our study), the  first problem is how to manipulate a 48kb genome.
Our solution for this problem is to divide the phage genome into eight  fragments. <STRONG><I>Figure 1</I></STRONG> shows the whole  phage genome as divided into fragments.</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:952px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><STRONG><EM>Figure 1:</EM></STRONG><EM><STRONG>A</STRONG>– phage  lambda genome with notations to the regulatory sequences (promoters and  operators), regulatory proteins, functional proteins and structural elements.

  The main challenge with the phages genome division is to avoid putting  regulatory elements with their regulated sequences. By doing so, we can prevent  the expression of harmful and lytic associated proteins to the host bacteria.  For example, all the lytic associated  proteins are located together in fragment 8 (F8), without any promoter  (PR) or activating protein (Q). 
  Moreover, due to the genome organization we can create function  correlated sequences, each containing several proteins with a specific purpose. For example, the phage head proteins are  located together in F1, and all the regulatory sequences are located in F6.</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Results">Results</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="pSB1C3.2BMCS">pSB1C3+MCS</SPAN></H4><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:402px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><STRONG><EM>Figure 2: </EM></STRONG><EM>pSB1C3+MCS digested  with various unique restriction enzymes.

The hybridized product was cloned into pSB1C3 using the XbaI and  PstI1 sites. The MCS contains the following unique restriction sites: EcoRI, XbaI, BglII, HindIII, PacI,  BamHI, SpeI and PstI.
To test the MCS, we digested 500ng of  plasmid with each of the restriction enzymes. The restriction products were ran  on a gel along with an uncut plasmid. The results are presented in <STRONG><EM>Figure  2</EM></STRONG>.</P><P>It can be noticed that all the enzymes cut efficiently except for XbaI.  After looking again at the sequence of the MCS it was found that the  combination of the overlapping XbaI and BglII sites created a GATC methylation  site. XbaI digestion is affected by this methylation. Therefore, to achieve  highest restriction efficiency with XbaI in this construct the plasmid should  be propagated in <EM>dam-</EM><EM>E. coli</EM> strains. A future improvement to  this MCS would be restoring the original BioBrick prefix by inserting a G downstream  to the XbaI site. This will destroy the BglII site but it will also destroy the  GATC sequence, therefore, restoring the XbaI restriction site to a non  methylated state.</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Phage_fragments">Phage fragments</SPAN></H4><P>Each fragment was amplified using PCR reaction, with the phage lambda's  genome as a template (The physical DNA was obtained from <A href="http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/products/productn3011.asp" class="external text" rel="nofollow">NEB</A>). This procedure needed a fine tuning, because  the amplification template was the phage's 48kb genome (which means more than  one band for most fragments…). The primers for this  reaction contained PacI and SpeI recognition sequences (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2012/e/ee/Phage_primers_for_wiki.xls" class="external text" rel="nofollow">see the primers sequences file</A>).

The ligation products were transformed into competent <EM>Top10-Rb</EM> (or <EM>Top10-Ca</EM>) bacteria, and were tested for the insert using colony PCR.

  Our  first step was to assemble two fragments, while using different lengths of  fragments' overlap and different concentrations of T5 exonuclease. We used  100bp, 250bp and 400bp overlap between F4 (8080bp) and F5 (6150bp). 
  The  fragments with the different overlap length were amplified using PCR reaction, with the phage lambda genome as a template. The sense primers were  identical to all the fragments, and the anti-sense primers were moved along the  phage genome, in order to create the different overlaps (<A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2012/e/ee/Phage_primers_for_wiki.xls" class="external text" rel="nofollow">see the primers sequences file</A>).

Therefore, we expect not to see any plaques on the growth plate in the phage with the deleted Q gene. 
Our next goal is to delete the Q gene from fragment 7 (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K784021" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K784021</A>) using deletion PCR, and re-insert it into a different position in the phage genome.

This is the region between the early left operon (sequence transcription starts with the P<SUB>L</SUB> promoter and regulated by N gene) and the late operon (sequence transcription starts from the P<SUB>R</SUB> and regulated by Q gene). The two operons are in opposite notations.
