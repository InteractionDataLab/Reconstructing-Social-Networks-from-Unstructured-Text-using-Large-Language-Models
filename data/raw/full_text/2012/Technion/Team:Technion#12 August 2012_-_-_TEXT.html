The sliced bands of SP6 gene from yesterday were purified by the gene elute extraction kit, the pured DNA concentration was 18 ng/ul.  I digest this sample (SP6) with the enzymes: XbaI-HF and PstI in NEBuffer 4+BSA. Also I digest pSB1C3 from the biobrick kit with XbaI-HF and PstI (same conditions).
After that, I ran in a agarose gel the SP6 gene and pSB1C3- sliced the bands and purified the samples by gene elute extraction kit. the concentration were 8.7 ng/ul for the pSB1C3, and 20.6 ng/ul for the SP6. I ligated those by T4 ligase overnight in 16C, the conditions of the ligation were: 6 ul from the plasmid, 9 ul from the SP6, 2ul liagse buffer, 2ul MB water and 1ul ligase (total volume was 20ul).
