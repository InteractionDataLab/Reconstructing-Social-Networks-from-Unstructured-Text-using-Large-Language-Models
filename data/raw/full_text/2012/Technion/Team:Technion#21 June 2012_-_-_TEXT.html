Eventually we only tried the PCR program Roee suggested. After running the results on the gel we still got a strong unexpected band at ~600 and a weak band at ~1200. After talking to Roee, we decided to redesign the primers. We will make them longer and with a longer overlap region for the fusion. Hopefully we will order them Sunday morning and receive them Tuesday. Maybe until we get the primers, we will clone the plux promoter from pSB1A2 into pSB1C3 so it will be ready for assembly of the other parts.
