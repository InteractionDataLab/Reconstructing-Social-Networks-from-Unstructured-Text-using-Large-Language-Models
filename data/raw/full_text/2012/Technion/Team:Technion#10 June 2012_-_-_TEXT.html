Ilya
Today we ran our PCR products on a gel. In the test lanes we got the expected bands at ~500bp and ~700 bp for the riboswitch and mCherry respectively. In the control lane (which didn't have a template) we got a band at ~500bp which means that we contaminated something. Hopefully, we only contaminated the control PCR reaction and not one of the ingredients. Tomorrow we will purify the PCR products, measure their concentration and set up the fusion PCR reaction.
This week is my duty to take care of the stuff we all need. I got us bottles, stands for ependorfs, stands for tubes and stands for pcr tubes. I also marked our boxes of tips, prepared SOB and autoclaved DDW.
