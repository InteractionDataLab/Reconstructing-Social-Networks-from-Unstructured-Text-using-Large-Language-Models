Ilya
- CIP for pSB1C3 and pSB3C5 cut with EcoRI and PstI.
- Cleaned pSB1C3 and pSB3C5 cut with EcoRI and PstI after CIP. Concentrations: pSB3C5-140 ng/ul, pSB1C3 - 11.8 ng/ul. The pSB3C5 is not logical. I took half a ul for ligation anyway.
- Ligation of pSB3C5+Fus2, pSB3C5+R0062+Fus1 and of pSB1C3+R0062+Fus1.
- Transformation of ligation products into Top10Rb.
Inbal
I did a starter from one colony that has grown on the LB+Amp plate (a colony with the plasmid pSB1A2+pTetO+GFP+ 2 terminators). Also I glycerol-stocked the TOP10 bacteria (with the plasmid pSB1C3 with SP6 RNAP gene+terminator)- It stored at -80C.
Later that day, I mini preped the starter with pSB1A2+pTetO+GFP+ 2 terminators and stored the sample in -20C.
Asaf
I minipreped another batch of Chris polymerase genes.

Noa
PCR for xyIE and ALP.
Running on gel of xyIE and ALP- xyIE good 4 bands, ALP no band at all.
Evgeni
Preparation of glycerol stock from the strains that were transformed with the plasmids we had got from Chris Voight.
