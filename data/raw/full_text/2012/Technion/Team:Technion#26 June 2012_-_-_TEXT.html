Ilya
Today I minipreped the two starters of pSB1A2+R0062 (the pLux promoter). However, I was late to class and didn't have time to measure the concentration so I don't know how much we have yet. I think we shouldn't try cutting the promoter out again. It will require starting with a lot of plasmid and we probably won't have enough for ligation at the end anyway. I think we should focus on the fusion PCR and once we get the RS+mCherry we can clone that next to the promoter. Then we will have a big enough insert to move into pSB1C3. We don't need the promoter by itself in pSB1C3 anyway. I hope the primers will arrive tomorrow so we can start the PCR.
