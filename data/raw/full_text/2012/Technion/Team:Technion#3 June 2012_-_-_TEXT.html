Ilya
Today we planned to do the transformations but the competent cells that were prepared last week turned out bad. We managed to get some competent cells from another lab. The cells were DH5-alpha competent for electroporation. I did the transformations of the pUC19+12.1-luciferase (1ul), BBa_R0062 (2 ul) and BBa_J06702 (2ul). The cells recovered in SOB (instead of SOC which was suggested by the lab we took the cells from) for an hour. Then they were plated on LB+Amp plates. For each transformation, 1 and 10 ul of transformed cells was diluted in 50 ul of LB and plated. The cells were incubated at 37 degrees overnight. Tomorrow we will check the transformation results.
