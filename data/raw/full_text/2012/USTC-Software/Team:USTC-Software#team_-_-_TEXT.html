Everything is yours!
Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.Making excellence a habit.
写给未来——我的Mr right
我不知道你会在什么时间 什么地点 什么场合­出现可是 我想你遇到我的时候可以一眼就把我认出来,就像我一直坚信我会在见到你的第一眼就认出你一样。
Mr right
Olympic-2012
舍不得你离开，但是不得不离开。这不是无奈，这是竞技体育的残酷。英雄般的倒下让我更加难过，但是很欣慰，哎哟喂，太矛盾了。精彩的比赛，我却不敢看上一遍，只怕。。。”

About Me
I feel very lucky that I could study at University of Science and Technology of China for one full year, and that's the reason I have the chance to become one number of USTC-Software team, I made so many best friends learned so much in the iGEM lab. My main work is for our team's wiki designing, so I hope you could love it.
Motto: Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.
