Kai Kang
Kai Kang, the team leader, is a senior undergraduate majoring in Optics at USTC. As the team leader, he participates in every major part of the project, from software programming to GUI design, from wiki development to human practice.
At school, he works at Key Laboratory of Quantum Information, CAS doing student researching. His researching interests include Optics and Optical sciences, Applied Physics, Computer vision and image processing. For more information, please visit kang-kai.com .
Kaifeng Chen
Kaifeng Chen is a senior undergraduate from the School of the Gifted Young(SGY) in USTC, and ranks No.1 among those who major in Physics in SGY. As a member of USTC-Software, he participates in software development and together with Chao Xu, builds Regulon Lib, an Clotho app for finding possible regulatory relations in Regulon DB.
At school, he works at Key Laboratory of Basic Plasma Physics, CAS & USTC, doing researches about classical SH model and Fokker-Planck equation. For more information, visit his home page .
Chao Xu
Chao Xu is a sophomore undergraduate in USTC. When he joined the USTC-Software last winter, he was only a freshmen, but immediately showed his ability and talents in coding and software development. He participates in software development, and builds a Clotho app with Kaifeng Chen. He is also good at image and video editing, and helps edit videos and photos.
Although only a sophomore, he has decided to join the Kay Laboratory of Quantum Information, CAS to do some researches. The road ahead is hard and long, but he is following his dreams.
Litong Jiang
A junior student in USTC, Litong Jiang majors in theoretical physics. She participated in wiki development and, together with Yunlong Zheng, did significant work in human practice. She enjoys working with her teammates and learns a lot form them. All these experiences will help her in the future study and researches.
Unlike many girls, Litong chose theoretical physics as her major, and hopes to have some contribution in the area.
Kaishuai Yang
Kaishuai Yang is now a second-year postgraduate in the Institute of Solid State Physics, CAS and studied in USTC for his first year. Kaishuai is a really hard-working guy and spent significant time learning web development. He spent the whole summer in USTC helping the team build the wiki site, and the final wiki site is built largely upon his work.
At present, he is studying in the Research Laboratory for Computational Materials Sciences ,  and doing computational materials research there. For more information, just visit his home page .
Sen Jiang
Sen Jiang, also know as JayXon, is a senior student in USTC. He is in charge of the GUI development of the project. In his spare time, he enjoys coding and has written many open-source softwares. With his experience of software development, the USTC-Software team is confident to build software with both performance and beauty.
He is running a website to share some of his softwares. Definitely check this out.
Qi Hu
Qi Hu is a second-year postgraduate student in USTC. He is good at image and video editing and works in the promotion part of the team. He edited the human practice video and helped design posters, wiki and T-shirts.
He majors in Automation and now works under the guidance of Dr. Meishen Xue . His research interests are in the wireless sensors network design, optimization of control and neural network. Go to his website for more information.
