Major steps of our project
Time-course or steady states data to input
Generating ODEs
Concerned about chemical reaction
Reaction network
GRN
Genetic circuits
Plasmid
Further evolution
8 steps' challenges
Data input: the number of time courses within
Generating ODEs: complexity & computing expenses(as we know, a software, at least, should be time-saving, then we discuss about the noise in the data, and the solution to deal with it, gaining a perfect curve without noise, which can fully represent the system.
Writing down the chemical reaction
Chemical reaction network, and optimize it. GRN graph should not be concerned about in isolation, in fact we should considerate GRN graph and chemical reaction comprehensively
Genetic circuit contain more than we thought, it contains promoter for example. Genetic circuit is needed in the competition. Some genetic circuits cannot realize in actual world. Filter the database, achieving a more reliable database that could contain the parameter we could use in the algorithm.
Plasmid
Extension connecting with other software. To gain this goal, interfaces of the database and output are must be considered.
Stress
scoring function is needed in the report; Stability's definition; How to measure it.; How to quantify the stability.
comprehensively considering the chemical reaction and the gene circuit. If could,, we can infer some of the chemical substances from the chemical reaction, for example.
