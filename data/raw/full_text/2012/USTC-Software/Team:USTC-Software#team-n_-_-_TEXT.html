About Me
I feel very lucky that I could study at University of Science and Technology of China for one full year, and that's the reason I have the chance to become one number of USTC-Software team, I made so many best friends learned so much in the iGEM lab. My main work is for our team's wiki designing, so I hope you could love it.
Motto: Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.
