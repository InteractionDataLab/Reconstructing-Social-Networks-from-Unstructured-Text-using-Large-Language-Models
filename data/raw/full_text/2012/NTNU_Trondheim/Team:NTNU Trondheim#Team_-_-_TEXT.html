Gunvor Røkke
Interests outside academia:
Mainly playing the violin. I have been playing since I was five years old, and I am currently leading one of the three folk music orchestras in Trondheim. I also like to swim, or to gab with my friends.
Areas of responsibility:

Team representative: In case of interested journalists, Gunvor will talk to them. Rolf will be her manager and Nina her stylist!
Team dietitian: One of Gunvor's less serious responsibility areas is to make sure that all team members get their daily dose of carbohydrates (as we all agree that lowcarb is nonsense).

Fun fact:
I'm able to whistle and hum in two part harmony with myself. And no, I'm not mutated.
