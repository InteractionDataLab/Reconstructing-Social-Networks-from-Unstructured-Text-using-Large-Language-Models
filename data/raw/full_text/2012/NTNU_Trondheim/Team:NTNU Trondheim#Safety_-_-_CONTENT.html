In these courses the participants have learnt about use of safety equipment, first aid, fire extinguishing, proper dispose of waste, and reading and understanding of safety data sheets of the substances in use. Use of different kinds of equipment and methods used have been taught, as well as writing scientific reports. The labs in use in this project are all approved for working with gene modified organisms (GMOs). 
</P><P>Lab coats, safety glasses and disposable gloves are used when necessary and when required by the HSE guidelines and rules. Materials such as restriction enzymes, buffers, PCR and Gel Purification kits are all bought from biotechnology companies. There are none additional safety precautions to be made than the ones already described. When making solutions of antibiotics, gloves and a fume hood are used, in addition to lab coat and glasses.
</P><P>When the lab’s not in use, it is locked with all of the equipment and materials/organisms safely stored away. A person that doesn’t belong there will not be able to enter. There are also security personel at the school at all times.
</P><P>Since these bacteria have plasmids with antibiotic resistance genes for selection, these can be harmful if released into the environment. To be sure, never bring GMOs outside of the lab and all of the materials and equipment contaminated by the GMOs, will be kept in special containers to be autoclaved. It any of the organisms were released to the environment, the biggest problem would be if the antibiotics resistance genes were transferred to other organisms. The natural occurring organisms can then influence humans, plants and animals. As long as the rules and regulations mentioned above (and also the rules and regulations give by the government, university and institute) are followed, this will not be an issue. The rules and regulations of the government, university and institute are given in the answer to question 3.

</P><UL><LI>	Did you document these issues in the Registry?
</LI><LI>	How did you manage to handle the safety issue?
</LI><LI>	How could other teams learn from your experience?
</LI></UL><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Answer_2">Answer</SPAN></H4><P>In this project the goal is to get<I>E. coli</I> to react to specific environmental factors that are found around cancer cells, such as high lactate and low oxygen concentrations. These qualities are not connected to the toxicity, infectivity or pathogenicity of the organism and are therefore considered not harmful. The strain of <I>E. coli</I> used is also not pathogenic (the DH5ɑ strain). 
</P><P>There is also one gene expressed under a constitutive promoter. The protein expressed named Colicin is a bacteriocin, a toxic for bacteria, and is produced by <I>E. coli</I>. Because it's produced in <I>E. coli</I>, it's a toxin humans are exposed all the time, through their intestines. It is then not considered harmful. Some scientists even consider using it as an anti-<I>Listerial</I> agent in meat products.

</LI><LI>	If no, which specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in your country?
</LI></UL><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Answer_3">Answer</SPAN></H4><P>The Health, Security and Environment (HSE) group at the university has certain rules and regulations used in all laboratories. These are rules of work environment and safety, information about these can be found here: <A href="http://www.ntnu.edu/hse" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.ntnu.edu/hse</A>. Lab work regulations can be found in the HSE handbook: <A href="http://www.ntnu.edu/hse/labhandbook" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.ntnu.edu/hse/labhandbook</A>. All of the rules and regulations are according to the rules set by the Norwegian government and the Norwegian Biotechnology Advisory Board (<A href="http://www.bion.no/english/norwegian-regulation" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.bion.no/english/norwegian-regulation</A>). The project is not in conflict with any of the rules and regulations from the government, university and institute. 
</P><P>Recombinant gene technology is also regulated in Norway by <A href="http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-19930402-038.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><I>Lov om framstilling og bruk av genmodifiserte organismer m.m.

Of particular importance at the Department of Biotechnology is the section on chemical and biological hazards (§4-5). Other governmental regulations also apply.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Question_4">Question 4</SPAN></H3><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Question_4">Question</SPAN></H4><P>Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Answer_4">Answer</SPAN></H4><P>In synthetic biology today, antibiotics are used as means for selecting the cells with the right plasmid. But, as mentioned, this can be a risk to other organisms if released into the wild. It it would be possible to select the GMOs with the right plasmid on basis of something else, it could make the risks of GMOs lower. 
</P><P>If it is possible, a good thing would be to make the organisms used in the lab unable to live in the wild. If they need very specific conditions to survive, the probability of them surviving in the wild or doing any other damage, will be lower.
