Team registration
The team has been registered. See our official team profile .
Complete Judging form
We have completed the judging form .
Team Wiki
We have set up a team wiki .
Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
We have prepared a poster and a presentation for the European jamboree.
At least one new submitted and well-characterized standard BioBrick Part or Device. A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts.
We have submitted and characterized a colicin E1 + immunoprotein device.
We have submitted and characterized a constitutive YFP generator .
We have submitted the lldPRD operon promoter + RBS from Escherichia coli. .
We have submitted the ldhA promoter + RBS from Corynebacterium glutamicum .
We have submitted a LacI generator .
Silver
Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected
We have demonstrated that two of our BioBrick parts work as expected, the colicin E1 + immunoprotein part and the constitutive YFP generator . We have characterized them and entered the information in the Parts Registry. Please take a look at our Experiments and results section.
Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
Gold
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year) and enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), and don't forget to create a new registry page for the improved part.
We have improved the Strong RBS + LacI repressor + double terminator part and entered the information of the corrected part, the LacI generator , into a new registry page. We sequenced the original BioBrick part, showing that it was not correct, reassembled it and confirmed that the sequence of the improved part was correct.
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
We have collaborated with the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology iGEM team . We constructed a stochastic model of their system and they helped us with the characterization of one of our lactate activated promoters, the pLLD promoter from Escherichia coli.
Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
We have created an online tool for facilitating collaboration between iGEM teams. We have called it the iGEM Matchmaker
Designed and built with MediaWiki , jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap .
