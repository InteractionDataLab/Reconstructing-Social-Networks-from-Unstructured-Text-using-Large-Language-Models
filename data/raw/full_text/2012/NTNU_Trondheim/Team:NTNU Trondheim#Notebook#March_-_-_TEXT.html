Friday 30.03.12
We kept discussing possible projects, and we now have several projects that would be interresting to work with. Here are the topics we have discussed so far:
Fatty acid synthesis in E.coli (EDA and DHA production)
Using cells in water purification
Using bacteria to remove hormones from wastewater
Using bacteria to remove sucralose from wastewater
Be able to control pili production in order to control electron transfer between cells
Biosensor detecting cancer cells, starting synthesis of chemoterapeutic drugs when cancer cells are detected
Biosensor detecting harmful bacteria
Making bacteria destroy oil spill
Digitalize a signal from an environmental stimulus
Biomining (using microorganisms to extract metals
Friday 16.03.12
We had a meeting, where we started discussing ideas for this year's iGEM project. We also decided to eat lunch together once a week, to get to know one another. For the outreach part of the project, Gunvor suggested that we could collaborate with Studentersamfundet to make a "lørdagsmøte" about synthetic biology.
