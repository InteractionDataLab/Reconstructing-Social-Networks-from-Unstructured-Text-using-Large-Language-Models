Present a poster and a talk at the iGEM Jamboree
Make poster and prepare talk
6.10 (Amsterdam) Also make project abstract (deadline: 03.09)
At least one new submitted and well-characterized standard BioBrick Part or Device. A new application of and outstanding documentation (quantitative data showing the Part’s/ Device’s function) of a previously existing BioBrick part in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry also counts.
lld promoter, quick and dirty characterization, and characterization by RHIT. Characterization of interaction between Plld and LldR by optical tweezers. Lysis-characterization of Plld from Corynebacterium glutamicum.

Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected

Characterize the operation of at least one new BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the “Main Page” section of that Part’s/Device’s Registry entry.
Plld either from E.coli or from C.glutamicum.

Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device (created by another team or your own institution in a previous year) and enter this information in the Registry (in the “Experience” section of that BioBrick’s Registry entry), and don't forget to create a new registry page for the improved part.
Nina is on it!
The growth of the Registry depends on having a broad base of reliable parts. This is why the improvement of an existing part is just as important as the creation and documentation of a new part. An "improvement" is anything that improves the functionality and ease-of-use of a part, so that it is more likely to be used by the community. For instance: strengthening the expression of a part by mutating the DNA sequence; modifying one or a few parts in construct (Device) so that it performs its intended job better; improving a cloning or expression vector that can be easily used by the entire community; and of course, troubleshooting and fixing a part reported to be non-functional. Data from an experimental comparison between the original and improved part/ device is strongly recommended.
Help another iGEM team by, for example, characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system.
Modell parts of RHiTs system stochastically.

Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
