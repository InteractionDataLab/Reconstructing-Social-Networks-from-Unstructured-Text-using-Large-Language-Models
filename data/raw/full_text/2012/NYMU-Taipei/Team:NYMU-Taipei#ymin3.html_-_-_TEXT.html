NosZ-NorCB
In Pseudomonas  aeruginosa PAO1, NorCB is found as two sub-units – nitric oxide reductase  subunit C and B. As a matter of fact, these two subunits are adjacent genes.  And thus we cloned them together to produce a functional reductase.

NosZ is the structure gene of nitrous  reductase. Very few microorganisms process similar enzyme, and many of them are  homologs according to NCBI database. Furthermore, it performs the last  procedure of bio-denitrification – nitrous oxides to nitrogen – in our model.
Obviously, the reason we cloned NorCB and  NosZ on the same plasmid is to connect the continuous denitrifying procedures  together.

NirN-NirS
Nitrite reductase  is composed of several different subunits. Together, it can reduce nitrite to  nitric oxide. We clone all these subunits together on the same plasmid in order  to grant cyanobacteria a functional protein.

Nap( Nitrate->Nitrite reductase)
Nap is periplasmic nitrate reductase, which  is known for the ability to reduce nitrate into nitrite. In microorganisms,  similar reductases are often observed. For instance, even E. coli has its own  nitrate reductase and can use nitrate as final electron acceptor. Moreover, we  acquire the Nap gene from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774.

Since Nir and Nap complex together would  link the reducing reaction from Nitrate to nitric oxide, we ligated these two  gene together and expressed them on Synechococcus  elongatus PCC 7942.
