Reprogramming of Somatic Cells into Stem (iPS) Cells
Induced  pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells )are stem cell-like cells derived from  reprogrammed somatic cells. iPS cells reprogramming is achieved by  simultaneously expressing 2-4 ES cell specific transcriptional factors  including Oct4, Sox2, Myc and Klf4/Lin28 using viral vectors (lentivirus or  retrovirus). The reprogramming process takes 15-30 days. First, somatic cells  such as fibroblast cells are infected with a mixture of viral particles  expressing the 2-4 stem cell factors. The infected cells are then seeded on  mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells and cultured in ES cell medium.  After 10-15 days, ES like colonies of cells will appear, can be picked and  expanded. Reprogramming can also be done without using MEF feeder cells. The  above materials are obtained from Dr. Chiou’s laboratory.
Separation of iPS Cells from MEF
Note:  All solutions and equipment that come in contact with the cells are sterile and  work is done in a laminar flow hood.
Materials:
Culture  medium :10% FBS-DMEM
Dissociation  reagent: trypsin
Remove  and discard the spent cell culture media from the culture vessel (10cm dish).
Wash  cells using balanced salt solution 1x PBS( Phosphate  buffered saline ) and rock the vessel back and forth several times.
Remove  and discard PBS from the culture vessel.
Add  pre-warmed trypsin 1 ml for a 15 cm-dish  cells to dissociate cells from the culture dish. Gently rock the container to  get complete coverage of the cell layer, and incubate the culture vessel at 37。C incubator for approximately 1  minute.
Observe  the cells under the microscope for detachment.
When  ≥ 90% of the cells have detached, add 7 to 8 ml of pre-warmed culture medium  and disperse it by pipetting over the cell layer surface several times.
Transfer  the cells to a 15-mL tube, then seed them back to the original dish and  incubate the culture vessel at 37。C incubator for 25 to 30 minutes. Note that the actual  incubation time and actual volume of medium vary with the sedimentation condition of iPS cells and MEF.
After 30 minutes, collect the supernatant filled  with non-sedimented iPS cells some for cell number counting and retain most of  the supernatant for further use.
Formation of Embryonic Body (EB) from iPS Cells
Formation  of embryonic body(EB) is achieved by static suspension culture in a Petri-dish  because the culture systems maintain a balance between iPS cell aggregation  essential for EB formation and prevention of EB agglomeration. The desired cell  concentration is 3*10^6 per 15 cm  dish. Add prepared iPS cells to a Petri-dish for the formation of EB.
Culturing of iPS Cells
Coating  0.1% gelatin on the culture dish and incubate for 30 minutes.
Add  medium into culture dish and incubate for 10 minutes.
Add  20ul embryonic body(EB) in 2ml medium.
Culture  EB cells until they attach on the plate with gelatin.
Do  the coculture experiment!
