Gene Cloning of Cys I Sulfite Reductase
Firstly, we get the whole gene sequence of Cys I  from NCBI web ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/878581 ). Cys I contain endogenous EcoRI and PstI site, so we can’t clone into  PSB1C3 directly.As a result, We create a noval cassette- new pSB1C3( Mfe  I-Xba I -pSB1C3-Sbf I-Spe I) for easily cloning. Taking advantage of MfeI and EcoRI are  compatible, also SbfI and XbaI, we can easily clone Cys I gene into pSB1C3  standard biobrick. Enzyme check by XbaI  and SbfI, we can get ~1700bp band, which means our gene constraction is  correct!!
Enzyme check of our plasmid shows that gene construction is correct
In order to establish stable expression cyanobacteria  system, we need to subclone our Cys I into stable expressing plasmid, pTrc-kan plasmid (constructed  by Prof. Chang). pSB1C3-Cys I cut with MfeI and SPeI. pTrc-kan cut with EcoRI  and XbaI. Finally we can get ~7100bp plasmid, pTrc-kan-Cys I gene. Enzyme check  by SpeI and get ~2100bp and ~3000bp bands.

Gene Cloning of Dsr Sulfite Reductase
As same as Cys I gene, we get the whole gene  sequence of Dsr I and Dsr II gene
from NCBI web  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/CAC09931.1). DsrI and DsrII also contain  endogenous EcoRI and PstI site, so we clone them into noval cassette- new pSB1C3( Mfe  I-Xba I -pSB1C3-Sbf I-Spe I). We create a BamH I site inside of DsrI and  DsrII, in order to combine them into a whole part, “Dsr”. Enzyme  check by XbaI and Spe I , we can get ~5800 bp, which means our gene  constraction is correct!! Subclone our Dsr into stable expressing plasmid, pTrc-kan plasmid  (constructed by Prof. Chang). pSB1C3-Dsr cut with MfeI and SPeI, pTrc-kan cut  with EcoRI and XbaI. Finally we can get ~9800bp plasmid, pTrc-kan-Dsr gene.  Enzyme check by BamHI, we can ~1200bp.
