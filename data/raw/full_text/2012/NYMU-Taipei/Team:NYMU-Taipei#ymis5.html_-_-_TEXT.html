Practical Application in Industrial Waste Detection
To  further practical use, we believe our artificial creatures have high ability to  digest H2S from industrial waste and keep our environment clean. Also, it’s a  good way to evaluate whether these sulfite reductase gene have high potential  to expressed on cyanobacteria or not. We cooperate with Chung Hwa Pulp  Corporation and get some industrial waste water and gas. By Co-culture with our  Cys I and Dsr expressing E.coli for 24hr and 48 hr, we predict that the  concentration of H2S will decrease dramatically. Both gas phase and water phase  of each group are analysed by Microvolume  turbidimetry method (mentioned above). Finally, the results are as the same as  we imagined. In other word, the H2S concentration decrease in both gas phase and water phase. We verify that our gene, Cys  I and Dsr work again!!
Using our artificial cyanobacteria and E.coli can clean the industrial waste produced by Chung Hwa Pulp Corporation
By simply co-culturing the waste gas and water with our modified cyanobacteria and E.coli, we can clean the pollution
In waste gas removal experiment, our pTrc-kan-Cys I and pTrc-kan-Dsr transformed E.coli have powerful ability to convert sulfite gas waste into H2S in both water and gas layer, compared to blank control pTrc-kan transformed E.coli
In waste water removal experiment, our pTrc-kan-Cys I and pTrc-kan-Dsr transformed E.coli also can convert sulfite water waste into H2S in both water and gas layer, compared to blank control pTrc-kan
