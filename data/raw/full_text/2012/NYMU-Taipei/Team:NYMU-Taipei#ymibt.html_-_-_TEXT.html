NYMU Bioenergy Team developed Enhanced CO2 Capturing Microalgae
A bioenergy research team led by Dr.  Chuan-Hsiung Chang, an associate professor at the Center for Systems and  Synthetic Biology in National Yang-Ming University (NYMU), has designed and  engineered a synthetic microalgal genome for enhancing carbon dioxide capture.  This research result has been published in the August issue of the world-class  top journal"Energy & Environmental Science"and is subjected to a  patent application.
Dr. Chang is leading a research team  working on genome analysis, design and engineering and currently engaging in  National Science Technology Program (NSTP) - Energy Project for Carbon Capture  and Storage (CCS) in Taiwan. The NYMU research team has developed a platform  for both Computer Aided Whole Genome Analysis (GenomeCAA) and Computer Aided  Whole Genome Design (GenomeCAD) based on the integration of Systems Biology and  Synthetic Biology. Through this integrated platform, Dr. Chang's genome team  was able to design a gene regulation system in microalgae cell for producing  and secreting carbonic anhydrase (CA), which was proved to increase CO2  absorption and to enhance the efficiency of microalgal CO2 bio-mitigation. This  excellent achievement has been invited to be presented in the International  Conference on Next Generation Technologies for Bioenergy and Biomass  Utilisation hold in Singapore in August this year (2012). Dr. Charles Harper of  MIT Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship in United States has  also expressed his interests in this report and has consulted about the detail  of this research result.
Dr. Chang's team has been using the  innovative platform of GenomeCAA and GenomeCAD to design and model the dynamic  interaction networks in engineered microbial cells. Through this computational  simulation of microbial biorobots, the target genes for engineering become easily  predictable and designable, and the achievements in biotechnology and  biomedicine could be greatly improved. Through this excellent achievement in  National Energy Program, the NYMU team not only builds up the relationship in  international cooperation in scientific research but also enhances Taiwan's  international competitiveness in genome-based green energy biotechnology. Dr.  Pei-Hong Chen, a team member as well as the first author of the publication in  Energy & Environmental Science journal, stated that,"CO2 Solutions  Inc. in Canada has commercialized the technology of CO2 capture by carbonic  anhydrase and performed several pilot trials in coal-fired industry. With the  technology of engineering cyanobacteria developed by Dr. Chang's team, the CA gene  can be integrated into the genome of cyanobacteria. The engineered CA-producing  cyanobacteria can replicate in nature so as to produce a large amount of CA  enzymes to capture CO2 in the air. This will greatly lower the cost of CO2  removal in the future."
The genome design and engineering  research team in NYMU led by Dr. Chang has patent applications supported by  National Science Council (NSC) National Program Office for GenomeCAA and  GenomeCAD. Based on the maturity of the technology platform of genome analysis,  design and engineering, Dr. Chang is actively seeking collaborations with  biotechnology and biomedicine industries. His team has already applied  GenomeCAA and GenomeCAD to valuable product research and development. And  through this integral technology platform, the time to market would be greatly  shortened and the effectiveness could be substantially improved.
