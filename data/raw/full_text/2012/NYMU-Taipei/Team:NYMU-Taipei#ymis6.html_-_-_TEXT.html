1. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans is a kind of  anaerobe bacteria, so it’s important to modify suitable environment for them.
In wrong way to culture Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, the mediun turn red
 
2. Bioinformation tools are convenient, by using  them, we can save lots of time, even though they are not totally right.
NCBI blast is a kind of powerful bioinformation tool ( http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ )
3. Standard plasmid-pSB1C3 is a unified biobrick. However, if target gene  with endogenous ECoRI, PstI, XbaI and SpeI site, we have to modify pSB1C3 and  create several new cloning site.
4. According to our experiment data compared to the standard  curve, we logical predict our Cys I sulfite reductase can remove at least 30uM  H2S in 48hr, which is quite big amount!! That is, our artificial cyanobacteria  can perform bioremediation.
5. Chemical microvolume turbidimetry method is a cheap,  easy H2S detection way. But, we still need to analyze H2S with GS/MS or HPLC to  increase specificity.
6. Due to H2S will dissolve into water, when analyzing  H2S with DPDA solution, we had better detect both water layer and gas layer.
