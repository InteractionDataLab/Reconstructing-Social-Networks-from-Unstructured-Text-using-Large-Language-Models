Into the cell
We construct a plasmid that contains LLO, invasin, and mRFP. Then  add the transgenic E.coli (absorbance of  0.5 at OD600, 1ml ) into the medium of amoeba (10ml) and  let stand for 1,4, 8, 12, 24 hours.
Then we observe the amoeba with fluorescent  microscope to see if there is any E.coli inside of amoeba. We also compared the  fluorescent between amoeba cell that were co-cultured with the cell. To make  sure the E.coli really stay INSIDE of amoeba. We use centrifugation to confirm  our observation. Dictystelium discoideum in ML-5 medium should be settled with  1000 x g for 4 min and E.coli should not be settled beneath 2000 x g for 5min.  We will test this statement. If it is true, then we will spin down the liquid  medium containing amoeba and E.coli at 1000 x g for 4 min. Two types of E.coli  will be tested. One can express LLO, invasin, and GFP; the other express GFP only.  Discard the supernatant after centrifugation and wash the  pellet with ML-5 medium. Repeat  three times. Then we can use the spectrometer to compare the fluorescence in  the pellet.
Kill-switch of  amoeba
We cloned and tested  the function of zinTp. The transgenic E.coli contains zinTp+GFP, which should fluoresce  when Cd2+ exist. We added different concentration of cadmium ion into LB medium  and compared the fluorescence level of E.coli which contain zinTp+GFP,  pTetR+GFP, and wildtype E.coli.
Tolerance to cadmium ions
We compared the tolerance level  between non-transgenic E.coli and transgenic E.coli. We tested the growth curve  of E.coli with different cadmium concentration.
