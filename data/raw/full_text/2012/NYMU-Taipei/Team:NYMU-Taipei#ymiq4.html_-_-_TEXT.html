Sulfide concentration and the growth of sqr expressing strain Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942
The  horizontal axis stands for day passed, while the vertical axis is the  absorbance of an OD 730nm. According to the graph, sqr expressing strain grew  much better than wild type strain when sulfide was added into the medium. This  result suggests that sqr is not only expressed but functional in the  cyanobacteria.
Standard curve
We  established a H2S standard curve to quantify H2S concentration inside our  experiments.
Lab Incubation with Escherichia coli
(1) Different Concentration under 24HR
We used different H2S concentration challenge ptrc-sqr transformed E.coli and tested H2S consumption in 24hrs. The result shows that ptrc-sqr transformed E.coli consumed much more H2S compred to the blank control, ptrc-str transformed E.coli. In other words, we believe our sqr gene works!!
(2)     Different  Concentration under 48HR
We followed the experiments in 48hrs and analyzed the H2S consumption in different groups. As the same as our expected, in 48hrs, our ptrc-sqr transformed E.coli depleted much more H2S than 24hrs timepoint.
Differences Between 24 HR and 48 HR under Same Concentration of H2S
(1) 500mM H2S
If  we analyze two group in the same H2S concentration, it’s easier to find out  that our ptrc-sqr transformed E.coli consumed H2S dramatically.
(2) 250mM H2S
The  experiment result are the same as previous group, ptrc-sqr transformed E.coli  can consume much more H2S.
(2) 125mM H2S
This  diagram illustrates that even at a concentration of 125mM of sodium sulfide,  the difference of consumption rate is obvious between sqr expressing strain and  wild type one.
