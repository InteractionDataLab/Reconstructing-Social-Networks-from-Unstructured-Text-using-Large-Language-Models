J774 Macrophage Cell Culturing
J774 cell line, a murine macrophages cell line established from a tumor that arose in a female BALB/c mouse, were provided by Prof. Yi-Hsuan Lee from National Yang Ming University.
View cultures using a microscopy and after the cultures was  full of the dish, remove the spent medium.
Wash the cell  monolayer with PBS and remove it.
Add medium(1ml  per 25 cm2 of surface area) and scrape cells down.
Ensure cells were  detached by a microscopy.
Centrifuge under  2000 rpm, 5minutes, 25°C.
Remove the supernatant  and add 5 ml medium to suspend cells.
Count the cells  by Bright Line Counting Chamber. Subject the cell diversity to 104/ml.
Seed the cells  for 104/well, 1ml/well in the 24-well plate.
Until cells grow  full of each well, do the coculturing experiment.
