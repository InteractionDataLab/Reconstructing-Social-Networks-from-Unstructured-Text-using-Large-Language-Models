Practical Application
Moreover, our  project has been put into practice thanks to the cooperation with Chung Hwa  Pulp Corporation. The wastewater generated by Pulp factories contains enormous  sulfide compounds and nitrate, which bring the annoying odors as well as the  contamination to the local environment. Fortunately, our project seems to be  the solution to their problem. This also demonstrates the potential and  possibility of commercialized our project. On top of that, the engineered  cyanobacteria can become the third endosymbiosis organelles with the help of  division inhibitor, gene for invasion. After installing our designation into  plants or even human cells as artificial organelles, we grant eukaryotes the  ability to survive in extreme environments as horrible as Venus in case the  space immigration is necessary on day.
