Overview
Are there Venusian? Is it possible that  there are creatures living on the Venus? Dreams will come true by the symbiosis  of cyanobacteria and eukaryotes.
Cyanobacteria obtain  their energy by photosynthesis. Sulfide-dependent photosynthesis cyanobacteria  could resist the harmful environment and do the electron transport by sulfide quinine  reductase(SQR), which we cloned previously. Additionally, references revealedwhen  engineered with invasin(inv) from Yersiniapestis and  listeriolysin O(llo) from Listeria monocytogenes, S. elongates was  able to invade cultured mammalian cells.
The symbiosis possibility of induced pluripotent stem cells from mice  and J774 mouse macrophage cell line were evaluated. Results  showed that invasin(inv,from Yersiniapestis) and listeriolysin O(llo, from Listeria monocytogenes) transformation would raise the entry speed and escape rate in J774 mouse macrophage cell line, and would increase the recruitment of  cyanobacteria on induced pluripotent stem cells.
