Function of Sulfite in E.coli
Sulfite reductase stable expressing cyanobacteria cost longer time and a  lot of money to set up. To check the function of constructed gene in advance,  we perform a chemical nephelometry assay to analyze the  function. We follow a paper done by Prof. I. Lavilla (Microvolume  turbidimetry for rapid and sensitive determination of the acid labile sulfide  fraction in waters after headspace single-drop microextraction with in situ generation of volatile hydrogen  sulfide, Analytica Chimica Acta 647 (2009) 112–116) to detect H2S. Due to our pTrc-kan-Cys I and pTrc-kan-Dsr  gene can turn on in E.coli, we transform these gene into DH5 alpha E.coli and  incubate in HSO3- contained LB medium. After 24hr and 48hr, we check  the medium and detect H2S concentration.
Using Microvolume turbidimetry method can detect micro amount H2S
Instead of using complex machine and expensive  HPLC, we use Zn(NH3)4·(OH)2  to absorp H2S, wich can form complex salt,〔Zn(OH3)6〕S. And then, add N,N–dimethy1-1,4-phenylenediammoniumdichloride(DPDA  solution) and ferrite chloride to form methyl blue. Finally, by analyzing  O.D.670, we can easily get H2S concentration. The  reaction fomula are as followed:
H2S＋Zn(NH3)4·(OH)2→〔Zn(OH3)6〕S＋2H2O
〔Zn(OH3)6〕S＋DADP/FeCl3→turbid/dark green-black(O.D.670nm)
(The same method used  in Environmental Protection Administration  Executive Yuan, Taiwan    http://www.niea.gov.tw/niea/AIR/A40671A.htm )
The picture shows DPDA structure and DPDA solution. When H2S exist, DPDA solution turn turbid
H2S serial dilution and standard curve detection
The curve is H2S standard serial diluted detected by O.D. 670nm
