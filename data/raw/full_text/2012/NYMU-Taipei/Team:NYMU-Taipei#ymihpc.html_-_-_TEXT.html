Meeting with NTU-Taida
National Taiwan University which is the best and  most historic college in Taiwan joins the iGEMcompetition first time. Both NTU and NYMU located in Taipei.  As a result, this meeting was easily held on June 1st without any  difficulty. Besides, some participants were friends or classmates during senior  high school.
Unlike the traditional meeting, we, NYMU-Taipei  iGEM Team, treated the friends from NTU and made the meeting like party. So,  we, NYMU-Taipei team, prepared some drink and delicious food.
NTU-Taida team showed their team-work ability. I was surprised that they have good project-design, perfect bio-circuit and models. I couldn’t believe that NTU-Taida just participated in iGEM this year. Compared to National Taiwan University, National Yang Ming University is just a biomedical school which is lack of departments like economic, politics, electronic, etc. Owing to it, our report might not be more abundant than them. But I thought our team had more creative idea than them. Also, our team presentation was great.
Both NTU and NYMU classmates weren’t afraid of  asking questions to the reporters. The members of two iGEM teams shared their  interest in Synthetic biology and learning. The questions from classmates let  us have more experience and learn more. It is a good activity for iGEMers to  devote themselves into. I hope we can have a meetup next time as soon as  possible.
