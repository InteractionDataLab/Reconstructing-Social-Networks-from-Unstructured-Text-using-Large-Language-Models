Result & Discussion
There  were three different types of cells we chose to do the coculture experiment. Part  1 revealed that J774 macrophage cell line enabled the entry of cyanobacteria by  phagocytosis. Part2 and part3 were both mouse induced pluripotent stem cells but in different stage of stem cells.  Secondly was non-EB iPS cells, separated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and subcultured on culture  dish. Thirdly was iPS cells in the Embryoid body (EB) stage. Later experiments showed  three parts of results, J774 macrophage cell line(figure 2), non-EB iPS cells(figure  3), and iPS cells at the EB  stage(figure 4). Red pots were S. elongates PCC7942 under fluorescence microscope  530-550 nm excitation filter. Under the transmitted light, transparent one was cells.
Part 1
Figure 2 revealed coculturing results of  J774 macrophage cell lines and S. elongatus PCC 7942(wildtype/inv-llo). After  24-hour coculturing and 24-hour cell culture under gentamycin 100 ug/ml, same  concentration of wildtype and inv-llo transformed type(both were OD 0.05) both entered  into J774 macrophage cell line by phagocytosis and the help of inv-llo.

Figure    2. Red pots were S. elongates    PCC7942.  Round and transparent one was    J774 macrophage cell line. By phagocytosis, wildtype and inv-llo type entered    into cells.
In  figure 2,(B)(D) were the images under the fluorescence microscope 530-550 nm excitation filter. Red pots were S.  elongates PCC7942. Under the transmitted light, round and transparent one was  J774 macrophage cell line. (A)(C) were the merged images of bright fields and  fluorescence. Compared inv-llo transformed type to wildtype, red pots of  inv-llo transformed type were less bright than those of wildtype. Additionally,  inv-llo transformed type numbers in cells were less than wildtype numbers. It  might suggest that inv-llo gene could raise the entry speed and the escape  rate.
Part 2
Figure  3 showed the coculture results of non-EB iPS cells. Cells and S.elongatus  PCC7942(wildtype/inv-llo). Images(A)(B)(E)(F)(G)(H) were inv-llo strain and  non-EB iPS cells coculturing results (A,B: under fluorescence microscope E~H:  under confocal laser microscope.) Cells and cyanobacteria at the separate focus  revealed the negative symbiosis. However, inv-llo plasmid showed that inv-llo would  recruit cyanobacteria to cells. 3D image under the confocal laser microscope(image  H) revealed the recruitment of cyanobacteria.

Figure    3. Red pots were S. elongates    PCC7942 under fluorescence microscope.     Transparent one was non-EB iPS cells. Both wildtype and inv-llo type could    not enter into cells but inv-llo type could trigger itself recruitment to    cells.
Part 3
Figure  4 revealed the coculture results of S.elongatus PCC 7942 (wt/inv-llo strain)and  iPS cells at EB stage.

Figure    4.
Red pots were S. elongates PCC7942 under    fluorescence microscope. Gray one was iPS cells at the EB stage. Results    showed that not many inv-llo PCC 7942 could enter into cells.
There  were similar and relative results of the iPS cells at EB stage and non-EB iPS  cells. Both inv-llo type of S.elongatus PCC7942 didn’t enter into stem cells  but triggered the recruitment to cells. Because embryoid body contained not  only one cell, the entry for cyanobacteria would be more difficult but the  recruitment provided a potential for invading mammalian cells. Future study  will focus on different coculturing condition and after invasion into stem  cells, differentiation could render Venusian.
