Modeling
Objective
Before designing  our experiment, we would like to do a simple simulation to estimate the  efficiency and productivity of nitrogen for our modified bacteria.
Description
In order to  produce nitrogen from nitrate, we needed to use Michaelis-Menten’s equation to  help us simulate the substrate concentration in a single cell.
Where v=reaction  rate, [P]=product concentration, Vmax=max reaction rate, [S]=substrate  concentration, Km= equilibrium  constant of enzyme, Kcat=turnover number.
Our pathway  looked like this
Reaction 2, 3, 4  were already in the E.coli before we engineered the bacteria. Reaction 1, 5, 6,  7 are the new pathways that we engineered.
For reaction 2,  3, 4, we used the equation
. 
As for the rest, we used
 instead.
To determine the  enzyme concentration for our new pathways, we needed another two equations.
Where nplasmid= plasmid copy number in E.coli, P=promoter strength, NA= Avogadaros' Number, VEcoli= cell volume of E.coli, deltamrna=degradation  rate of mRNA, alpha= translation rate of mRNA, gammaEnzyme=degradation  rate or Enzyme
Combined  the two equations, we got the relationship between enzyme concentration and  time.
Then we combined  the equation above with Michaelis-Menten’s equation.
