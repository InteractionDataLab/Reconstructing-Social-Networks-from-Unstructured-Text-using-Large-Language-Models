iGEM Demonstration in NYMU Club Exibition
In the middle of September, National Yang Ming University  will hold an orientation for the freshmen about two days. In the afternoon of  second day, September 13th , there will be an exhibition for many clubs to  introduce themselves to the freshmen from 14:00 to 19:30.
Our iGEM team got a booth to show our poster and let people  extract the plasmid of E. coli in person according to our lab’s protocol we  will also spread our project’s propaganda material to attract people from our  freshman, other students, and the masses to come to our stall. Just like the  northern welcome party for the freshmen of medical department, we want to  attract more potential enthusiasts to join iGEM and synthetic biology!
