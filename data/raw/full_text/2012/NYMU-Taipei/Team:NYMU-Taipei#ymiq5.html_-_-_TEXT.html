Sulfite quinine reductase, SQR use  hydrogen sulfide, H2S as electron resource to perform photosynthesis
In previous experiment, we’ve demonstrated that Sulfide-Quinone Reductase (sqr) expressed in Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 enhanced the growth of the unicellular cyanobacteria. Nevertheless, most of our observations were based on the difference of optical density between wild type and sqr expressing strain. Though it is quite common to estimate the growth of cyanobacteria by measuring the optical density under certain wavelength, such measurement only provides an approximate data for comparison, and various factors can influence the observation accuracy, With regard to that, we conduct another series of experiments via flow cytometer and plate count method to examine the exact cell concentration.
Cyanobacteria contain different of cytochrome. We can detect them by different wavelength fluorescent light.

Cyanobacteria Culture
Both wild type and sqr stain of Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 were  cultivated in BG-11 medium (Allen M.M. 1968) [1]. The initial cell  concentration was adjusted to an OD730 of 0.2. The experiment was initialized  after the addition of unicellular blue-green algae, and the six-well plates  were placed on a 100 r.p.m. shaker.
We culture Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 wildtype and sqr transformed one in BG-11 medium with suitable shaker.
DCMU blocking assay
Freshly made sodium sulfide containing  medium was added into the experiment group. The concentration of sodium sulfide  was 2.5 mM, and additional 2.5mM of sodium sulfide was added every 24 hours. 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea  (DCMU) [2], a chemical which can block photosystem II was also added into both  experiment and control group. A positive control group was established by  simply cultivated cyanobacteria in fresh medium. As followed, we analyze by  flow cytometry analysis, 730 nm absorption assay and plating of bacteria.

Flow cytometry analysis
We use flow cytometry with multiple wavelength fluorescent light to find out the differences between two groups.
The automation of viability analysis method  via flow cytometer was reported in previous research [3]. In our experiment, cells  were analyzed using a flow cytometer FACSCanto. The chlorophyll fluorescence  filter set (excitation: 435/40 nm; beam splitter: 510 nm; emission: 515 nm  long-pass) were used [3]. By using the automated counting function of FACSCanto,  we examined the accurate number of cell. The green fluorescence of the cell  area was constrained at an intensity value of 50 to differentiate between red  (viable) and green (non-viable) cells [3]. The percentage of red and green  cells and the exact cell concentration was calculated.

Results & Discussion
We kill wildtype cyanobacteria  with 4oC environment for 2 weeks
We find out that when adding  Na2S to our DCMU blocked SQR bacteria, they show more fluorescent light(higher  photosynthesis ability, live better)
We find out that when bacteria are  challenged with DCMU, SQR group can live better than Wldtype group, which means  SQR gene help cyanobacteria survive in the adversity(DCMU, Na2S)
It’s very interesting when we  compare data:
When DCMU challenge bacteria,  SQR transformed croup can produce more fluorescent light(higher photosynthesis  ability, live better)
In SQR group, we use DCMU to challenge bacteria. Adding Na2S bacteria produce more fluorescent light.
We survey several papers and hypothesize that the fluorescent comes from cytochrome b6f, which is an important role in the downstream of photosynthesis system II and the electron transport chain.  (Erwin J. G. Peterman,Stephan-Olav Wenk et al, Fluorescence and Absorption Spectroscopy of the Weakly Fluorescent Chlorophyll a in Cytochrome b6f of Synechocystis PCC6803, Biophysical Journal Volume 75 July 1998 389–398)
730 nm absorption
Based on the  flow cytometry result, we double check our bacteria amount by 730nm absorption:
When challenge  bacteria with DCMU, SQR transformed cyanobacteria live better than wildtype(higher photosynthesis, better adversity resistance)
It’s very  interesting that when add Na2S into two kinds of bacteria, it might produce  more difficulty for living(maybe the Na2S concentration is wrong? HS-  binds to Fe and generate worse environment for bacteria)
Plating of bacteria
Viable cell concentrations were also  determined by spreading 0.1 mL of culturing cyanobacteria on BG-11 agar plates.  Colony counts were conducted after these plates were incubated for 7 days at  room temperature. The plating was performed in duplicates for every sample.
We culture bacteria into solid plate. After incubation for about 10 days, we will count the colonies and compare each group.
CO2 consumption analysis
We culture two group bacteria with stable lamina CO2 input and compare the CO2 for each group.
It’s very interesting that when adding Na2S  to both two bacteria group, we get the similar result. We hypothesize that Na2S  might generate adversity to bacteria. Thus, It’s very important to analyze CO2  consumption. CO2 concentration and analysis were examined by the  infrared CO2 analyzer and FL22 Algal CO2 Package respectively  [4]. Cyanobacteria samples were cultured for 24 hours following CO2 analysis.  CO2 fixation rates were calculated in terms of CO2  exchange rate as the following equation:
The HCO3 concentration in the  culture medium was also measured with Carbon Dioxide Enzymatic Assay of BQ Kits  (Bio-Quant, USA).
We will analyze CO2 consumption for SQR grop and wildtype cyanobacteria to find out the activity of them. Finally, We will use DCMU to challenge two groups of bacteria and perform this assay again ( http://www.quora.com/Carbon-Dioxide )
