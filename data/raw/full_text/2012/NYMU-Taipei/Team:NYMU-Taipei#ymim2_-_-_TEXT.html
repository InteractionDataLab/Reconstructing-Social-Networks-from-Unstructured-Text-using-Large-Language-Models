Results
In the figure  above, it showed that most nitrates were converted into ammonia. And the  productivity of nitrogen was quite low.
After 1440 min(1  day), only 10-12 mM of nitrogen were produced by an E.coli. But if  we combined the cell growth of E.coli with the equation, the result would be  different.
This figure  showed us the relationship between different enzyme concentration and time.
Conclusion
Even though the  concentration of nitrogen we produced was low, but the toxicity of ammonia was  much lower than the NOx produced by the industrial factories. It might still be  a good way to apply our pathway to eliminate the toxic NOx compounds.
