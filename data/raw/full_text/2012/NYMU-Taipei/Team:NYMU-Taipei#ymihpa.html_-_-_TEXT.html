2012 Taiwan iGEMer Fest
Synthetic biology is a new research area which has been  developing at an amazing speed in recent years. One of the important events  that contribute to its development is the International Genetically Engineered  Machine (iGEM) competition. Students that participate in iGEM share their ideas  with top students all around the world by building their own biological systems  using standard, interchangeable parts.
Students from Taiwan began to participate in this event from  2007. The number of teams from Taiwan has increased to 4 from only 1 at the  beginning. Considering that Taiwan is a small island on the Earth and lack of source  to let all students do their best on international event, a platform for  communication and cooperation between students from Taiwan are really needed.  So, a  meeting for Taiwan iGEMers -- 2012 Taiwan  iGEMer fest -- held at National Yang Ming University  (NYMU) on August 15th (Wed).
The  theme of this meeting is “iGEM – let the crazy idea come true". During the meeting, students made subjective  reports and reviews. iGEM teams display the current progress of their projects,  and share their experiences with meeting participants.
The meeting will open to all undergraduates, graduate  students and researchers who are interested in iGEM and synthetic biology. We  encourage the participants to interact with each participant during this time  meetup. The meetup is supported by Institute of Biomedical informatics, NYMU.
Feedback
I’m so  glad to have the opportunity to  participate in the 2012 Taiwan iGEMer fest because this is the first time that  iGEM teams from Taiwan got together to share our interest in Synthetic biology  and iGEM. As a freshman in NYMU-Taipei iGEM team and just coming to NYMU nearly  a year ago, the happy in my mind cannot be described with words.
At the beginning  of the fest, the leaders of three teams introduced each team members to  everyone. Although we had probably communicate with each other before on the  facebook where offers the client a way to  build up clubs, I  made a lot of friends who study in NTU or NCTU.
The teachers who participated in  the meetup paid attention to each team’s report and gave a lot of good advice  to immediately after the report. In this meetup, each team had 30 minutes to  answer the questions from teachers or other two teams. I thought it’s a good  program to help us get more experience and learn.
Besides,  when the guys made a discussion on the cooperation issue, we shared a lot of  new ideas with each and enjoyed funs. We planned a lot of new ways of human  practice and prepared to implement.
