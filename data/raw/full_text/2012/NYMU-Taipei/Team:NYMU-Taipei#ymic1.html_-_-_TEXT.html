Overview
We’ve  built the endosymbiotic system to clean up cadmium  contamination. The engineered organism can collect cadmium ion in the soil and can be easily gather together;  moreover, the device won’t become another pollution source to our environment.
Cadmium contamination is a serious  problem in many countries; cadmium can cause respiratory  system damage, renal failure, bones softening, and, maybe the most infamous  case in Asia, Itai-itai disease. The rice absorbed the cadmium in the soil and  the cadmium accumulated in the people eating contaminated rice. The aim of our  project is to build up a system that can collect Cadmium ion in the soil and  can be easily gather together; besides, we don’t want our device become another  pollution source to our environment. We found that the endosymbiotic system  between the soil-living amoeba Dictyostelium  discoideum and E.coli would be  our favorite solution.
Cadmium ions were absorbed by amoeba then  accumulated inside of E.coli
Why Dictyostelium discoideum
Dictyostelium discoideum is a soil-living amoeba, so it is a good choice to  collect cadmium ion in soil. In addition, the amoeba naturally has endosymbiont  inside the cell. The E.coli living in amoeba accumulates cadmium ions, just  like an organelle, the E.coli acts as a compartment preventing its host from  cadmium poisoning. Furthermore, keeping the E.coli inside the amoeba avoid unexpectedly  gene exchange between engineered E.coli and other wild types bacteria.  Moreover, Dictyostelium discoideum chemotaxis is well-studied and can be easily  gather by adding cAMP.
Single cell amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum gathered  when cAMP was added.
