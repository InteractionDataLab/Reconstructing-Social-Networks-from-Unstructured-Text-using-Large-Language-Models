Welcome Party for Freshmen in National Yang Ming University
By the end of August, the newborn list of all departments of the  National Yang Ming University will be announced. Sophomores of those  departments will hold welcome parties in the northern, central, southern area  of Taiwan respectively to introduce the events, environment, curriculums, and  all kinds of clubs of the National Yang Ming University to the freshmen and let  our freshmen to be familiar with each other.
In Saturday afternoon, August 25th, in the northern welcome party of  medical department, the attendance was up to 100 people, and we got a chance  introduce what is iGEM, how about the development of synthetic biology, and  what our iGEM team of National Yang Ming University had done from 2007 t0 2012.
After the party, many freshmen of the medical department asked lots of  interesting questions and wanted to know how to participate in iGEM team of  NYMU next year by our team members and our discussing platform on facebook.
These results not only indicated that we have successfully achieved our  goal of spreading the idea of iGEM and synthetic biology and attracting the  interest of our freshmen! It senses that we will make more people to take  attention and join the field of synthetic biology!
