Collaboration with NTU
Since  long ago, We’ve  had close relationship with NTU-Taida  iGEMers. By inviting them for a iGEMers fest, meeting with each other,  technique assistance and having FUN together, we elevate the quality of our  projects. As a result, we, NMYU-Taipei team collaborated with NTU-Taida again!!
In similar, both NMYU-Taipei and NTU-Taida team did bacteria engineering. In our projects, we utilized  cyanobacteria to remove several pollutants inside our environment. Moreover, we  try to achieve Venusian goals. Fortunately, NTU-Taida had a powerful promoter,  a thermosensitive promoter, phs, which is suitable for gene expression on Venus  (high temperature environment). So NTU-Taida help us to create two new plasmid,  phs-CysI and phs-SQR.
 
 
In NTU-Taida’s project, they  want to create a impotent E.coli which help people to lost weight. The gene  express function is quite important in their artificial E.coli. That’s the  reason why we help NTU-Taida to quality control their bacteria. To test the  plasmid removal rate of bacteria the incubated three plasmid transformed  E.coli, IR, tnpR, SmBC and diluted in to 10-7, 10-8, 10-9  three different concentration. Then we incubated E.cloi in LB solid agar  plate and calculated the colonies of each group. We found out that the same  result we got as NTU-Taida did. That is to say, they got a reliable data, also  we successfully quality controlled of their E.coli.
 
The result indicates that tnpR, SmBC transformed  E.coli have much more E.coli colonies, compared to the IR tansformed E.coli. In  other words, IR have higher removal rate that is the same as our expected.
