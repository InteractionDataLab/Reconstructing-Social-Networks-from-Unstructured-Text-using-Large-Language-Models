Data for Our Favourite New Parts
Main Page  - SQR(sulfide       quinone reductase), BBa_K896000: Sulfide-dependent anoxygenic       photosynthesis, driven by photosystem I (PS/I) alone, among cyanobacteria       was first described for Oscillatoria limnetica from Solar Lake. Later       photosynthetic sulfide oxidation in O. limnetica led to the discovery of       sulfide-quinone reductase (SQR; E.C.1.8.5.), a novel enzyme that transfers       electrons from sulfide into the quinone pool.
Main Page  - CysI       (surfite reductase), BBa_K896001: We have successfully expressed and photoconverted       this protein in E. coli cells. It reduces (HSO3)-       to H2S using the embedded electron transfer system in E.coli
Main Page  - DsrI-DsrII(surfite       reductase), BBa_K896002: There are two sulfite reductase operon, DsrI       and DsrII, inside Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. They might be membrane form       Dsr operon and free form Dsr operon. The Dsr gene’s construction in       E.coli, cyanobacteria and used bacteria to remove SO2 in our environment       has been accomplished by us.
Parts We Have Improved
Experience  - Part: BBa_K896012: When engineered with       invasin(inv) from Yersinia pestis and listeriolysin O(llo) from Listeria       monocytogenes, new S. elongatus was able to invade into cultured mammalian       cells and was capable of symbiosis with eukaryotic cells. The symbiosis       possibility of induced pluripotent stem cells from mice and J774 mouse       macrophage cell line were evaluated. We had also accomplished the       symbiosis experiment.
We've Also Created and Characterised the Following Parts
Main Page  - Sulfide       quinone reductase(SQR) on neutral site 2 vector, BBa_K896003: SQR could transfer electrons from sulfide into the       quinone pool and trigger the sulfide-dependent photosynthesis, which is only based on photosystem I and shuttle the photosystem II down. The neutral site 2 vector(4538 bp) consists of       trc promoter(1718-1963 bp), multiple cloning site(1965-2014 bp), and       Streptomycin resistence gene(2555-3343 bp).
Main Page  – NosZ+NorCB,       BBa_K896004: NorCB is composed of two sub-unit – nitric oxide       reductase subunit C and B. In fact, these two subunits are adjacent genes.       And thus we cloned them together to produce a functional reductase. And       NosZ is the structure gene of nitrous reductase. Furthermore, it performs       the last procedure of bio-denitrification in our model. Obviously, the       reason we cloned NorCB and NosZ on the same plasmid is to connect the       continuous denitrifying procedures together.( We clone NosZ and NorCB and ligate them together.       However, since there are PstI enzyme cutting site inside the NorCB, so we       clone a new pSB1C3 backbone which contain EcoRI.XbaI.SpeI.SbfI enzyme       cutting site.)
Main Page  - NorCB,       BBa_K896005: NorCB(Nitric oxide reductase subunit C and B)can transfer nitric       oxide into nitrous oxide. We receive this part from the genomic DNA of       Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.
Main Page  - NirN-NirS       (Nitrite->Nitric oxide reductase), BBa_K896006: Nitrite reductase       is composed of several different subunits. Together, it can reduce nitrite       to nitric oxide. We clone all these subunits together on the same plasmid       in order to grant cyanobacteria a functional protein
Main Page  - Nap(       Nitrate->Nitrite reductase), BBa_K896007: Nap is periplasmic       nitrate reductase, which is known for the ability to reduce nitrate into       nitrite. In microorganisms, similar reductases are often observed. Even E.       coli has its own nitrate reductase and can use nitrate as final electron       acceptor.
Main Page  - pYodA       (Cd2+ sensing promoter), BBa_K896008: ZinTp       (pYodA) is a promoter which expresses the downstream gene in the presence       of cadmium ion. The activity of this promoter is specific affect by       cadmium ion and won’t be induced by other ions like zinc, copper, cobalt,       and nickel.
Main Page  - pYodA+GFP(       Cd2+ biosensor ), BBa_K896009: Combine       with GFP to prove the expression of pYodA(BBa_K896008).
Main Page  - smtA (       Cd2+ absorbing protein), BBa_K896010: Metallothionein       (MT) is a family of cysteine-rich, low molecular weight (MW ranging from       500 to 14000 Da) proteins. MTs have the capacity to bind both       physiological (such as zinc, copper, selenium) and xenobiotic (such as       cadmium, mercury, silver, arsenic) heavy metals through the thiol group of       its cysteine residues .
