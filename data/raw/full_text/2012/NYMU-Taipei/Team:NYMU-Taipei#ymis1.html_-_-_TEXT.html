Overview
Sulfur Oxides (SOX, SO2) is the main precursors of air pollution  which is a deteriorating problem nowadays. Producing acid rain and acidified  soils, Sulfur Oxides not  only result in breathing problems such as asthma, pneumonia, but destroy farm crops,  buildings and environment, causing millions in lost each year.
Sulfur dioxide is the main reason of acid rain. We transform bacteria with sulfide reductase and take advantage of them to solve the problem.
In order to achieve bioremediation,  we choose cyanobacteria as our target organ. However, there is no rose without thorn. Due to lost sulfur  metabolism functions, We use synthetic biology and gene cloning technique to complete  sulfur metabolism pathway inside cyanobacteria.

Sulfur metabolism pathway in KEGG shows that cyanobacteria don’t have ability to reduce sulfur dioxide. So, we engineer bacteria with sulfide reductase.
