Paper Survey and Bioinformatic Searching
In order to realize whole sulfur metabolism pathway, we use several  bioinformation web site such as KEGG(http://www.genome.jp/kegg) and  NCBI(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) . We can find out several important  enzyme to reach our goal- digest SOX and produce H2S for further metabolism  pathway in our artificial creatures. According to a research done by Prof. Werner  Badziong (Growth Yields and Growth Rates of. Desulfovibrio  vulgaris (Marburg) Growing on Hydrogen  plus Sulfate and Hydrogen plus Thiosulfate as the Sole Energy Sources,  Arch. Microbiol. 117, 209-214 [1978]), four  enzyme are involved to produace H2S. They are ATP sulfurylase, APS reductase, sulfite  reductase and pyrophosphatase. Completing 1.8.99.1, sulfite reductase, we clone  it from a sulfur reducing bacteria(SRB), desulfovibrio  desulfuricans, known as DsrI and DsrII. We also clone 1.8.99.1, sulfite  reductase from pseudomonas aeruginosa PAOI, which is Cys I.

Bioinformatic Analysis of Enzyme Trans-Membrane Domain
Sulfite reductases have two types, that is,  membrane form(located on cell membrane) and free form(located inside cell  membrane). Among which, free form are the best choice since the folding and  structure are more stable. We use bioinformation tools-  ExPASy( http://expasy.org/ ) to  predict the transmembrane domain of each sulfite reductase. The result shows  that Dsr I, DsrI and Cys I enzymes don’t have any transmembrane domain. That  is, they might be free form enzymes. As the result, we combine DsrI and DsrII  gene to form “Dsr”. We use “Dsr” and “CysI” gene, two sulfite reductase from  different bacteria, as our target gene in this part.
Membrane electronic prediction shows that no  transmembrane domain exist(from left to right: Cys I domain I, Cys I domain II, Dsr domain I,Dsr domain II)
