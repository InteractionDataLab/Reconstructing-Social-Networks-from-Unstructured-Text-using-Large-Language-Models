Conclusion
We’ve already created a powerful  artificial cyanobacteria with useful sulfite reductase, Cys I and Dsr, which can remove SOX from environment and protect our earth.
We’ve already established sulfite reductase, Cys I and Dsr, two biobricks. The thing is they work powerfully. Among which, CysI can remove at least 30uM H2S in 48hr!!
In the future, with sulfite reductase, we can perform our project to next step- utilize the resource from Venus or even create Venusians!!
