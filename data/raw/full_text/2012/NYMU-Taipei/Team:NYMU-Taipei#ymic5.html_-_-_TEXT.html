Conclusion & References
We have successfully  cloned zinTp into pSB1C3
We have successfully  cloned zinTp-GFP into pSB1C3
We have characterized  zinTp function. The expression of downstream gene will increase when added  cadmium ion into LB medium, and the maximum transcription rate occurs around 60  min after added 200μM cadmium.
We have successfully  cloned mnt into pSB1C3
We have successfully  cloned smtA into pSB1C3
We have characterized  smtA function. When expressing smtA, it enhances E.coli tolerance to cadmium.
