Introduction
Cyanobacteria obtain  their energy by photosynthesis. In previous research in our study, we hope to  create new type Synechococcus  elongatus PCC7942 which could do both the nitrogen and sulfide  metabolism. This new cyanobacteria would survive on the SO2-rich environment on  the Venus. Meanwhile,when engineered with invasin(inv) from Yersiniapestis and  listeriolysin O(llo) from Listeria monocytogenes (both provided by Pamela A. Silver, Harvard Medical school), S. elongates was  able to invade cultured mammalian cells.
J774 mouse macrophage cell line, a kind of differentiate  cells, could engulf cyanobacteria not only by phagocytosis but speedy by the  inv-llo engineering help. Additionally, stem cells can divid and differentiate into diverse specialized cell types and can self-renew  to produce more stem cells.  In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate  into all the specialized cells (called pluripotent cells). Induced pluripotent stem  cells (iPS cells ) are stem cell-like cells derived from reprogrammed somatic  cells. IPS cells are then seeded on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder  cells and cultured in ES cell medium. After separation iPS cells from MEF,  non-EB iPS cells can be gotten. After culturing non-EB iPS cells on the petri dish, iPS cells at Embryoid Body(EB) stage can  be obtained. Embryoid Body (EB) culture is used to examine the differentiation  potential of the embryonic stem (ES) cells.
Thus, if engineered cyanobacteria can invade into stem cells  and produce energy and O2 by photosynthesis, a dream of creating  Venusians would not be far.
