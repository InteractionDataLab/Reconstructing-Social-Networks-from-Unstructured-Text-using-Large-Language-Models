Cloning zinTp into pSB1C3 plasmid
We got the right plasmid which contained zinTp
Characterizing of zinTp
In this fig we could  see that before 60 min, the fluorescence level of zinTp+GFP steadily increased,  while BBa_I13522 (positive control) remained stable around 35000 au as time  gone by. At 60 min, zinTp reached its maximum transcription rate so the  fluorescence level stop increasing around 55000 au.
Fluorescence level at 15mins after Cd2+  added
This fig shows the fluorescence level of  different cadmium concentration. We can see that BBa_I13522 remained stable  from different cadmium concentration, while the fluorescence level of zinTp+GFP  increased as the cadmium concentration increased. We could also tell that the  transcription rate of zinTp is fairly low when there is no cadmium ion.
Cloning mnt into pSB1C3 plasmid
Mnt gene was successfully cloned into pSB1C3 plasmid
Cloning mnt into pSB1C3 plasmid
smtA gene was successfully cloned into pSB1C3 plasmid
Characterizing of smtA
Cadmium 0/200/500μM Medium
This fig shows that smtA enhances the tolerance  level to cadmium ion. In wild type E.coli, OD595 differ from between  0/200/500μM cadmium concentration. E.coli hardly grow in 500μM cadmium medium. However, the E.coli which can express smtA seem to show  no significant different between 0 & 200μM cadmium medium.
8 hours after cadmium added
OD of WT E.coli  decrease when cadmium concentration increase. The E.coli which can express smtA  seem to have stronger resistance to cadmium toxicity and the E.coli  concentration show no significant different from 0 to 200μM cadmium medium.
E.coli which could express smtA growth better than wild type in 200μM Cd+2 medium
