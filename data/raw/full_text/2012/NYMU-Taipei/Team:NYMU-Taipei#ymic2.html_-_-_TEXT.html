Into  the cell
By  cloning LLO and invasin into the E.coli, the bacteria can get into the amoeba  and live inside it. Invasin helps the cell to be endocytosed by  the host. Then Listeriolysin O makes the cell escaped from phagosomes in the  cytoplasm of the host.
Cadmium accumulation
To  enhanced E.coli’s ability of gathering cadmium ions, we clone smtA and mnt gene  into the E.coli. SmtA is a cadmium binding  metallothionein, which can bind to cadmium ions. Mnt is an ion transporter that  pumps cadmium ions inside the bacteria.
The main idea of how E.coli and Dictyostelium discoideum system works.
 
---smtA---
Metallothionein (MT) is a family  of cysteine-rich, low molecular weight (MW ranging from 500 to 14000 Da)  proteins. MTs have the capacity to bind both physiological (such as zinc,  copper, selenium) and xenobiotic (such as cadmium, mercury, silver, arsenic)  heavy metals through the thiol group of its cysteine residues (1) .
Synechococcus PCC. 7942  gene smtA encodes the protein designated to be a metallothionein (MT). While  expressing this gene in E.coli, it can increase cadmium ion tolerance of E.coli  and so does the accumulation of cadmium ion (2) (3) .
---mnt---
Mnt gene is the  Mg2+/Cd2+ transporter which belongs to ABC transporters system. The ATP-binding  cassette (ABC) transporters form one of the largest known protein families, and  are widespread in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. They couple ATP hydrolysis  to active transport. The structure of a prokaryotic ABC transporter usually  consists of three components; typically two integral membrane proteins each  having six transmembrane segments, two peripheral proteins that bind and  hydrolyze ATP, and a periplasmic (or lipoprotein) substrate-binding protein.  Many of the genes for the three components form operons as in fact observed in  many bacterial and archaeal genomes. (4)
Cloning mntA gene into E.coli can increase  Cd2+ uptake.
Biosafety Consideration
--- Precaution  against Horizontal gene transfer – Living inside of amoeba---
Horizontal gene transfer(HGT) is a  serious issue concerning the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)  into the environment. To prevent HGT, we must make sure our genetic modified  E.coli will never join their wild type relations. Our solution is to put the  engineered E.coli into amoeba, so the E.coli cannot contact the environment  directly. Whenever wild type bacteria break into the amoeba, they will be  digested.
--- Precaution  against becoming invasive species - Kill switch of Amoeba---
To make sure our  genetic modified organisms will stay in the area where we want them to clean up  cadmium ions, we also build a kill-switch that will switch on when there is no  cadmium ion in the soil. The kill-switch has two man-made operons. The first  one includes zinTp(previous name pYodA), this promoter activity is induce by  cadmium ion; and its constructive gene is lacI. The other one includes BBa_R0010,  the promoter whose activity is inhibited by the protein lacI; and the  constructive gene DdaifA and HlyA(BBa_K223054). DdaifA is a protein that cause  the apoptosis of Dictyostelium discoideum cell. HlyA is a tag that stick after  the target protein. With this tag, E.coli will secrete the target protein. When  cadmium ions exist, zinTp works and lacI is generated, so the expression of  aifA and HlyA is repressed. If there is no cadmium ions, BBa_R0010 will  activate the expression of aifA and HlyA, so the protein aifA will be secrete  right into the cytoplasm of amoeba, causing amoeba apoptosis.
 
---ZinTp---
ZinTp (pYodA) is a promoter which expresses  the downstream gene in the presence of cadmium ion. The activity of this  promoter is specific affect by cadmium ion and won’t be induced by other ions  like zinc, copper, cobalt, and nickel (5) .
Strain AL6 (λФ PyodA–lacZ) was grown aerobically in LB medium at  37°C in presence (●) or absence (○) of cadmium (136±5μM) β-Galactosidase activity in the       presence (■) or absence (□) of tested  agents was also measured.
 
---DdaifA---
Apoptosis-inducing  factor (AIF) is involved in a caspase-independent cell death pathway. Dictyostelium discoideum has a homolog  of mammalian AIF, which could cause nuclei breakdown, leading the cell to the  apoptosis program (6) .
DdAIF induces damage of mammalian and Dictyostelium nuclei in a cell-free system. (E) shows the quantification of damaged nuclei induced by cytoplasmic extracts. Damaged nuclei were assessed by the disappearance of the nucleoli. One hundred nuclei were counted in each condition. Histograms are the mean of three independent experiments. Nu, nucleolus; Dnu, dying cells nucleolus. Dictyostelium cells (control CE), Dictyostelium cells treated with PPIX to cause cell death (dying cells CE). Cytoplasmic extracts of dying cells were also immunodepleted with anti-DdAIF (dying cells CE -AIF) or with nonimmune serum (dying cells CE NIS)
