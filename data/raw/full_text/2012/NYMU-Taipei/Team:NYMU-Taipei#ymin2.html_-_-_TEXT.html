Methods
Recently, the  search for biological nitrogen removal method from wastewaters and exhaust air  has come up with several promising methods; however, most of them just took  advantage of some special bacteria combined with industrial procedures. On the  contrary, our iGEM project aim to reduce nitrogen oxides and oxidize sulfide  compounds at the same time.
During the  processes of denitrification, sulfide compounds and nitrate act as electron  donor and acceptor respectively. This reaction is also known as sulfide-driven  denitrification. Researchers have reported that E. coli can perform such  reaction when expresses sqr gene from R.  capsulatus. Herein, we enable certain type of cyanobacteria to take  advantage of sulfide and reduce nitrogen oxide compounds into nitrogen. The  BLAST result shows that sqr genes are homolog in R. capsulatus and Synechocystis  sp. PCC 6803.    For  denitrification, we plan to get access to Thiobacillus  denitrificans, the well-known chemolithotrophic organisms. Nevertheless, we  later found it difficult to obtain the specific strain we need. According to  NCBI database, enzymes for denitrification such as nir, nor, nos share great  similarity between Thiobacillus  denitrificans and Pseudomonas  aeruginosa PAO1, so we adopted P.  aeruginosa PAO1 instead and expressed the enzymes mentioned above in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.

These  denitrifying enzymes are functional under aerobic condition, yet like all  cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 produces oxygen during photosynthesis. Fortunately, when sulfide presents in the  environment and sqr is expressed, it will cease producing oxygen and use  sulfide as an electron donor for carbon dioxide photoassimilation. Together  with dsrI and dsrII enzymes from Desulfovibrio  desulfuricans, our engineered organisms are capable of reducing three major  oxides pollution – nitrogen, sulfur and carbon oxides.
