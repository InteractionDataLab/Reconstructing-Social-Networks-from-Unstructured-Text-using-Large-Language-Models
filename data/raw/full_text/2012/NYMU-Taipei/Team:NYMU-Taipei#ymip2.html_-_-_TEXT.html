Mesenchymal Stem Cells Culturing
Mesenchymal stem  cells from human umbilical cord  were provided by Prof. Chun-Min  Lo from National Yang Ming University.
View cultures using a microscopy and after the cultures was  full of the dish, remove the spent medium.
Wash the cell  monolayer with PBS and remove it.
Add HyQTase(1ml  per 25 cm2 of surface area) and incubate for 1 minutes.
After making sure  cells were detached, resuspend the cells with medium(more than 5 folds volume  of HyQTase).
Centrifuge under  2000 rpm, 5minutes, 25°C.
Remove the supernatant  and add 5 ml medium to suspend cells.
Count the cells  by Bright Line Counting Chamber. Subject the cell diversity to 104/ml
Seed the cells  for 104/well, 1ml/well in the 24-well plate.
Until cells grow  full of each well, do the coculturing experiment.
