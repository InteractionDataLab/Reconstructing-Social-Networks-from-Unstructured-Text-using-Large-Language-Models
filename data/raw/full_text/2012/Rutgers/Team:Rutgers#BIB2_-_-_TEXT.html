Biofuels in Biology
To develop strains of bacteria that produce high levels of 1-butanol we have introduced the genes coding for a biochemical pathway from Clostridium acetobutylicum into a mutant E. coli strain that produces a high level of NADH.The combination of these chemical pathways is predicted to increase the level of butanol production.. >> Read more... Plasmid Map Results
The Etch-a-Sketch project aims to create a lawn of bacteria that can be drawn on with a laser pointer. This seemingly inconsequential task actually presents many interesting engineering challenges. We have designed a novel genetic switch to tackle these problems. If our work proves successful, it will serve as a useful model for future projects that require large signal amplification.

Organism: DH10B
Operon: aceEF-lpd
http://www.biocyc.org/ECOL316385/NEW-IMAGE?type=OPERON&object=TUH9B-53
aceE aceF
The aceE coding region of DNA codes for a protein that operates as a pyruvate dyhydrogenase.  This plays a key role in the beginning of the pathway, as the pyruvate is broken down into Acetyl-CoA.  The aceF coding region of DNA codes for a protein that acts as a dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, which is also responsible for pyruvate decarboxylation which links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle.  
aceE
(pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit)
Organism: DH10B
Amino Acid: 887
Nucleotides: 2664
http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ecd:ECDH10B_0094
Note: this gene has EcoRI site, needs to be optimized
aceF
(dihydrollpoamide acetyltransferase)
Amino Acids: 630
Nucleotides: 1893
http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ecd:ECDH10B_0095
lpd
(dihydrollpoamide dehydrogenase)
Amino Acids: 474
Nucleotides: 1425
http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ecd:ECDH10B_0096
Butanol Production in E. Coli
We have focused on implementing a 1-butanol producing biochemical pathway, initially found in Clostridium, into the very well known model organism E. coli.
