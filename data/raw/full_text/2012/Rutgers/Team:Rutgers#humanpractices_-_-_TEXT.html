RUiGEM: 2012
Biofuels in Biology
To develop strains of bacteria that produce high levels of 1-butanol we have introduced the genes coding for a biochemical pathway from Clostridium acetobutylicum into a mutant E. coli strain that produces a high level of NADH.The combination of these chemical pathways is predicted to increase the level of butanol production.. >> Read more... Plasmid Map Results
The Etch-a-Sketch project aims to create a lawn of bacteria that can be drawn on with a laser pointer. This seemingly inconsequential task actually presents many interesting engineering challenges. We have designed a novel genetic switch to tackle these problems. If our work proves successful, it will serve as a useful model for future projects that require large signal amplification.

Rutgers University Human Practices
The Rutgers iGEM team is in the early stages of developing  mobile software for researchers to use on their mobile phones and other mobile  devices.  Currently, the synthetic  biology industry is in its infancy in terms of software toolkits. 
The Rutgers  University mobile software team is working to create a piece of mobile software  that allows the user to view DNA sequencing files, better known as .ABI files,  on mobile devices. The user will have the ability to edit, compare, and blast  various DNA sequences. 
 
Software Methodology
Bioinformatics, a fast growing branch of biology and data science utilizes powerful tools to study genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic and other 'omics' .
Allowing such tools on a smart phone allows a scientist to make powerful decisions about his or her research quickly.
Here, we decided to utilize only two of these powerful tools: BLAST and a multiple sequence algorithm such as CLUSTALW.
BLAST, ( Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is a sequence analysis program that can be used to make inferences such as species identification and phylogenetic analysis along with protein domain homology and structure in the case of proteins. CLUSTALW can make global multiple alignments of DNA and protein sequences.
Our prospective app aims to read an ABI trace file format. This file is an output of a sequencing run where probabilities of a base occurance are scored. In days, unknown DNA can be sequenced and in minutes understood.
We hope that this  app will thrust biology into the world of technology. As scientists we know  that nothing can stay still forever, things are constantly evolving. As such we  must do the same and bring our practices to the next generation.
