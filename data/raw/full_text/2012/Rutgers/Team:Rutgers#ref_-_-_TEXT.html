RUiGEM: 2012
Biofuels in Biology
To develop strains of bacteria that produce high levels of 1-butanol we have introduced the genes coding for a biochemical pathway from Clostridium acetobutylicum into a mutant E. coli strain that produces a high level of NADH.The combination of these chemical pathways is predicted to increase the level of butanol production.. >> Read more... Plasmid Map Results
The Etch-a-Sketch project aims to create a lawn of bacteria that can be drawn on with a laser pointer. This seemingly inconsequential task actually presents many interesting engineering challenges. We have designed a novel genetic switch to tackle these problems. If our work proves successful, it will serve as a useful model for future projects that require large signal amplification.
