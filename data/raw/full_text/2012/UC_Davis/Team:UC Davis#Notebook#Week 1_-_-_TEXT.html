Week 1
Monday June 18th
Re-hydrated Parts to get practice:
J23101
E0240
E0040
R0010
pSB1C3
pSB1A3
pSB1AK3
pSB1K3
B0034
I13602
Transformed these parts into E. coli strain DH5α
We cultured 4 parts from glycerol stocks for more practice!
J45120 for wintergreen smell! In 2mM salisylic acid.
J45200 for banana smell! In 5mM isoamyl alcohol.
R0010 for it's promoting abilities.
E0240 for GFP!
We also narrowed our project down to three ideas:
Producing spider silk proteins in bacteria.
Degrading plastics in bacteria.
Creating an Archaea toolkit and using them for bioplastic, biofuel, and isoprenoid production.
Tuesday June 19th
Smelled banana scented E. coli.
Miniprepped the R0010 and E0240 liquid cultures.
Messed up the protocol twice due to inexperience, and got to practice DNA purifications! Nanodropped the miniprep samples to teach people how to use this instrument.
Made liquid cultures from our colonies from yesterday's transformation.
Set up a digestion of the R0010 and E0240 parts. (Cut R0010 at SpeI and PstI sites; cut E0240 at XbaI and PstI).
Made a small 1% agarose gel.
Made plates and LB media.
Read papers on spider silk and plastic degradation
Wednesday June 20th
Miniprepped the liquid cultures from yesterday.
Nanodropped the samples.
Ran the digested parts from yesterday on the gel and extracted them.
Ligated and transformed these parts.
Made iGEM Contact List. Narrowed the project down to plastic degradation and Archaea.
Thursday June 21st
Ligation was unsuccessful
Ate sushi buffet. Continued the tradition for team bonding.
Friday June 22nd
Met with the advisors. Narrowed down our project to one of plastic degradation. We also want to construct an Archaea tool kit.
To be continued...
