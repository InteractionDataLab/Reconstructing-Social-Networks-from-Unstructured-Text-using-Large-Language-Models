We wanted to re-hydrate some parts, they are listed below. They were located in the distribution kits.
J23100 J23119 J23100 I13453 I13458 C0012 K206000
Along with these parts, we also looked at a new miniprep kit that was given to us for free, titled Biobasic. We wanted to test it in comparison to the Invitrogen kit we currently use. Following the hydration we transformed the parts and left them overnight in the 37 degree room

Today we did a double digest of B0034 at the S and P sites and sequentially digested B0034 first at the E site using Buffer 4.
We miniprepped samples using both the Invitrogen and Biobasic kits. Using the nanodrop spectroscopy, we determined that the Invitrogen kit was still better, so we continued to use that.
We also began to look into Gibson assembly, and due to past iGEM inability to attain success, we requested the protocol from the iGEM Washington 2011 team.
