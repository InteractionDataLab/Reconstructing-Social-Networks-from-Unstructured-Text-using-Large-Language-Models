Monday -Research. We ruled out the spider silk idea and decided to focus our attention on plastic degradation. The toolkit idea was also considered a secondary project idea.  Tuesday -We practiced lab protocols a bit more, and conducted more research after finding out the planned trip to the landfill. We also prepared questions and did research concerning what the landfill does and how we can benefit from it.  Wednesday -Today we went to the Yolo County Landfill to meet with Ramin Yazdani, the senior civil engineer at the landfill. We were given a tour of the landfill, and discussed procedures and systems Dr. Yazdani has in place regarding the decomposition of trash, specifically in terms of methanogens and methanotrophs. He similarly provided us with guidance concerning the direction of our project, and the possible application and impact our project could potentially have in terms of trash degradation.  Thursday -We spoke with our mentors regarding the feasibility of our project within the given time span. Ruled out polyurethane due to toxic byproducts.  Friday -Conducted more research in engineering methanogens and methanotrophs. We also looking into how our project could apply to the landfill, and discussed the feasibility of PET degradation versus methanotroph and methanogen
