Week 3
Monday July 2nd
We further looked into the means by which our project can be outlined and planned.  -Our team read a paper titled Isolation of a Novel Cutinase Homolog with Polyethylene Terephthalate-Degrading Activity from Leaf-Branch Compost by Using a Metagenomic Approach to further understand the mechanism by which cutinase assists in plastic degradation.  -We looked at the value of surface modification, specifically how it alters PET and whether or not it is valuable.  -Research was conducted on PelB and the potential for a scar, and furthermore whether a scar will influence our results.
Tuesday July 3rd
Today we focused on wet-lab procedures -We rehydrated the PelB tag (J32015), T7 constitutive promoter (I719005), Stop (B0015), And LuxR inducible promoter (C0062).  -We also transformed the parts mentioned above. TRANSFORMATION PROCEDURE HYPERLINK HERE. -We plated the parts. PROCUDURE HERE
Wednesday July 4th
-We took the previous day's plates and ran liquid cultures on all of them. PROCUDURE -We took a half day for July 4th!
Thursday July 5th
-We conducted a double digest of the T7 constitutive promoter (I719005) and Ribosome Binding Site (B0034). DOUBLE DIGEST PROCEDURE -We worked on the safety page of our wiki after concern arose regarding the safety of procedures in our planned project.  We continued research regarding how we can plan and carry out our project.
Friday July 6th
-We created an in-depth plan for how we were going to assess our project. We divided the project up into manageable sections and assigned particular areas to people on our team.  -We took a look at the requirements for achieving the Gold medal, and wrote down and organized how we are going to achieve each criteria.
