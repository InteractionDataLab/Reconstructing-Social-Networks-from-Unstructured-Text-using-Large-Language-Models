Cutinase Activity
As of now, through our p-nitrophenyl butyrate assays we have gathered enough data to determine that our LC-Cutinase part ( BBa_K936000 ) exhibits its intended function as an esterase. Unfortunately it has been much more difficult to characterize than expected as we have been unable to purify the protein successfully.
