Week 1: April 9th to April 15th
The summer semester  begins and the biological experiment comes, so this week we mainly focus on  acquiring the basic experimental skills. As we are green-hands in the field of  synthetic biology, everyone feels very disturbed, One of our advisor Wu Xin  cheers us up and teaches us how to transform, the protocol of plasmid  extraction, how to run on a gel for restriction analysis, how to recover the  DNA and ligate two target fragment.
Monday,  April 9th
We learn how to  isolate the plasmids and how to run on a gel for restriction analysis.  Everything is new for us!!!
Tuesday,  April 10th
Today we complete  the inoculation of BL21, K176003, lysis, RBS1.0
Wednesday,  April 11th
The task today is  as follow:
Inoculate K176003,  RBS 1.0.
Transfer PBAD into competence BL21.
Make media for two  sleeves of plates, one sleeve with Kan antibiotic added, the other with Amp.
Thursday,  April 12th
Today we pick one  colony to a new culture medium, isolate the plasmid K176003, RBS1.0 on the morning  and isolate the plasmid PBAD at night.
Friday, April 13th
Saturday,  April 14th
Everyone is busy,  so there is no experimental plan.
Sunday,  April 15th
To make us more  skilled at the experimental manipulation, we inoculate K176003, RBS1.0 PBAD,  isolate the plasmid K176003, RBS1.0, PBAD again.
Week 2: April 16th to April 22nd
Monday,  April 16th
Today we  want to make sure whether the time plasmid placed can influence the  digestion, so we chose to do a series of test. The gel electrophoresis results  shows that there is no much relation between the time plasmid placed and the  digestion.
Tuesday,  April 17th
Today we  isolate the plasmid PBAD, RBS1.0 without the help of advisor Wu Xin.  the steps of plasmid extraction are too hard for us to complete them without  any mistakes. We waste many centrifuge tubes and pipet tips. However, we  finally make it.
Wednesday,  April 18th
It is an  awful day!! Plasmids from the previous day are digested and run on a gel for  restriction analysis, but we got a bad result. We can only be thankful that we  acquired the protocol of agarose gel electrophoresis. Compared with plasmid  extraction, electrophoresis is easier. But we need to make the gel and grasp the  method to use microwave oven.
Thursday,  April 19th
The task  today is to run on a gel for restriction analysis of PBAD, RBS1.0 again. The result shows that we can recover PBAD, RBS1.0 and ligate  them.
Friday, April 20th
Today we complete  inoculating BL21 and transferring PBAD-RBS1.0 into competence BL21.
The next three days  we are all so busy about our study that we decide to work on next week.
Week 3: April 23rd to April 29th
Tuesday,  April 24th
We pick  one colony and put the tubes into shaker on the morning and complete the  plasmid extraction at night.
Wednesday,  April 25th
We  complete the plasmid extraction of GFP-TT, PBAD-RBS1.0 and make glycerol stocks of GFP-TT, PBAD-RBS1.0.
Thursday,  April 26th
Today we  isolate the plasmid GFP-TT, PBAD-RBS1.0 and run on a gel for  restriction analysis. Then we recover the fragment PBAD-RBS1.0, GFP-TT and  ligate them.
Friday, April 27th
Today we  complete the transformation of PBAD-RBS1.0-GFP-TT into competence  BL21.
Saturday,  April 28th
We are  puzzled to find that the transformation fails. So we pick one colony (PBAD and GFP-TT) and put the tubes into shaker again.
Sunday,  April 29th
Today we do the  repetitive work of April 26th.
May
Week 4: April 30 to May 6th
Monday,  April 30th
The task  today is to transfer PBAD-RBS1.0-GFP-TT into competence BL21.
Tuesday,  May 1st
We found  that the plate were all covered with colonies on the morning, so we have a  discussion about the failure of the transformation, Wu supposes that there is  some problem with BL21 or Amp, so we inoculate new BL21 again, and we set  control group as well. At night, the result reassures us of Amp, so we  speculate BL21 is polluted and inoculate new BL21.
Wednesday,  May 2nd
 Today we isolate the plasmid PBAD,  GFP at night.
Thursday,  May 3rd
The task  today is as follow:
Digest  the plasmid PBAD, GFP and run on a gel for restriction analysis,  then recover the objective strap. Ligate PBAD-RBS-GFP.
Friday, May 4th
Today we complete  the transformation of PBAD-RBS-GFP into competence BL21.
Saturday,  May 5th
We find  that the plates are all covered with colonies, so we prepare the Amp solution  again.
Sunday,  May 6th
Weekend  day for us!!
Week 5: May 7th to May 13th
Monday,  May 7th
The  transformation of PBAD-RBS-GFP proves to be a failure, so we do the repetitive  work of May 3rd.
Tuesday,  May 8th
Today we  transfer PBAD-RBS-GFP into competence BL21 again.
Wednesday,  May 9th
Awful  day!!!!The effort we took yesterday is in vain, the plate is covered with so  many colonies which is irregular ,  so we decide to choose streak plate to inoculate after a short meeting.
Thursday,  May 10th
Today  Yao isolates and digest the plasmid PBAD-RBS-GFP and run on a gel for restriction analysis. Despite the operating error, DNA  agarose gel electrophoresis indicates that we succeed in the transformation.
Friday, May 11th
The task today is  to pick one colony to a new culture medium and make glycerol stocks of PBAD-RBS-GFP.
Saturday,  May 12th
Sunday,  May 13th
Another weekday for  us! But we are not relaxed, we have to read more literature to make our project  go well.
On the other hand,  we make the plan for next week.
Week 6: May 14th to May 20th
Monday,  May 14th
After  our weekends, we come back to our lab, the task today is to inoculate BL21 at  night.
Tuesday,  May 15th
 We found some useful biobricks information the  other day, but we didn’t acquire the information of PtetR completely. So today  we only transfer PcI into the competence BL21.

Today we  pick one colony and cultivate it. At night we are heart-struck to find that  there are no bacteria in the medium, so we inoculate again.
Thursday,  May 17th
Today we  isolate the plasmids and digest them with the system below:
PcI: SpeI + PstI
RBS-GFP-TT: XbaI +  PstI
Then we  run on a gel for restriction analysis on the afternoon and recover the  objective strap, ligate PcI- RBS-GFP-TT.
Friday, May 18th
Today we  completed the transformation of PcI- RBS-GFP-TT.
Saturday,  May 19th
Sunday,  May 20th
Time  flies!! Another week is gone! We realize our project moves slowly, we have to  speed up!!!
Week 7: May 21st to May 27th
Monday,  May 21st
The task  today is to pick one colony and cultivate it, then isolated the plasmid at  night.
Tuesday,  May 22nd
What a  tragedy! Today we digest the plasmid run on a gel, but we find that our agarose  gel was polluted after the electrophoresis, the image is so bad that we can’t  make it out.
Wednesday,  May 23rd
Begin  the digestion of PcI- RBS-GFP-TT again, fortunately, the result shows that our  ligation succeeded.
Thursday,  May 24th
Today we  rejigger our ideas, a fresh plasmid!! We prepared the solid medium, and  transfer the plasmid from the Plasmid powder plate that MIT provided.

We  extract plasmid of 15L, Separately carried on the single enzyme and double  enzyme test to identify 15L, 4E-TT, 18A, 6I, PR-2L-TT. This afternoon, we run a  glue includes 15L, 18A, 4E-TT, PR-2L-TT and 6I
Thursday, June 28th
Today’s  work seems easier. We inoculate RBS and 4E-TT, then pick the colony of 4A-TT. Last,  streak the TT-1
Friday, June 29th
We extract the  plasmid of RBS, 4A-TT, TT-1, 4E-TT,identify the 4A-TT and TT-1, but the size of  TT-1 is wrong. We also link the 6I and RBS, RBS and 4A-TT, RBS and  4E-TT.Later,we preserve strains of 4A-TT and 4A-TT.
Saturday, June 30th
Today, we transform  the RBS+[4A-TT], RBS+[4E-TT],then coating plates. Extract the plasmid of 15L  and TT-1 and identify them, but the result is not right: we cannot see the line  of TT, while the 15L has 3 bandings.
Sunday, July 1st
We pick the colony  of RBS+ [4A-TT], RBS+[4E-TT] and 15L.later ,we extract the plasmid of TT,2L and  2L ,then identify them. The result is pleasant. This afternoon, we extract  R-AT, R-ET, 18A and 15L.
Week 13: July 2nd to July 8th
Many  team members were away for internship in another city. Experiments progress  became very slow.
Week 14: July 9th to July 15th
Monday,  July 9th
This  week, another three of the team members were away for internship in Zhangzhou  Campus. It meant only three members were available for the experiment.
Colonies  were grown well in the morning. Pick one colony of each plate and cultivated.
After 12  hours we isolated the plasmids.
Tuesday,  July 10th
Plasmids  from the previous day were digested and ran on a gel for restriction analysis,  however the result of the gel indicated the ligation was not totally  successful: RBS-gfp(LVA)-TT should be reconstructed. So we pick another colony  from the plate.
Wednesday,  July 11th
Prepared  the competence BL21 cells and transferred the succeed ligation product: PBAD-RBS-cI(LVA)-TT,  RBS-tetR (LVA)-TT. Isolated the plasmids of RBS-GFP (LVA)-TT and digested for  restriction analysis. After running on a gel, the plasmid turned to be right.
Thursday,  12th
Pick one  colony
all of  the previously transformed and isolated parts were also used to run an agarose  gel confirming the identity of the transformed parts.
Week 15: July 15th to July 22nd
Monday,  July 16th
 Wiki:
SUNNY  MONDAY!! Got up at 8:00AM and started a new week in lab. Wang realized the fact  that it would be a huge project to translate all the experimental journals into  English in last few weeks. So she started writing the new journals in English  and translating the original ones.
 Experiments:
Goal: Pcons+RBS-tetR-TT,  PBAD+RBS-cI-TT
At  10:00AM, no growth/colonies were observed on the plates. However, by the late  afternoon, colonies were visible on all of the plates, so picked one colony and  cultivated it.
Plasmids  isolated and digested for ligation. BSA was added in XbaI system as description.  After 1 h of digest, we  ran on a gel. An  unanticipated band revealed the possible mistake of target gene: the band of  plasmid with BSA addition was wrong. We planed to test the BSA the next day and  do another digest for restriction analysis. To speed up, we would perform  ligation if the restriction analysis was correct.
 Meeting:
Team  meeting at 7:00PM, Leader Wu divided all the members into different groups and  announced the assignments for each group: Experiment, Wiki, Human Practice, Management,  Communication. He also reiterated the experimental disciplines. Wang summarized  the experiments and pointed out our next steps: finish all the construction in  two weeks and characterize our device.
Tuesday,  17th
Experiments:
 Isolated the plasmids and digested for  analysis and ligation as well. We ran on a control test for BSA. The result of  gel indicated that problems existed both on BSA and the bacteria we preserved,  which seemed had been contaminated.
Wednesday,  18th
Experiments
Goal: To  verify all the bacterial glycerol stocks and the transformation.
Experiment:
Isolated  the plasmids, digested for restriction analysis and ran on a gel. The result  was frustrating: they were all wrong! We should perform ligation again as soon  as possible.
Thursday,  July 19th
Experiments:
Goal: To  ligate PcI+Rgfp(LVA)TT, Pcons+RtetR(LVA)TT
Isolated  the plasmid and digest for ligation. Ran on a gel and performed gel extraction.  After 4h of ligation, transferred into competence BL21 which were prepared in  July 16th.
Made  plates with Amp
Friday,  July 20th
Colonies  were still invisible until late afternoon. Exciting news was that the colonies  of PcI-RBS-GFP(LVA)-TT had    fluorescence, which indicated the possible successful of transformation.  But the other one was not good: colonies could be observed only in one plate.  In the evening, picked colonies and cultivated them. 
  
Saturday,  July 21st
Experiments:
Goal: To  verify if the transformation was successful.
Plasmids  isolated and digested for restrict analysis. The result was upset but we still  stuck at it - after all, the bacterial liquid culture was illuminating. So  picked another two colonies in the plate and hoped for the best.
Sunday,  July 22nd
Experiments:
Goal: To  verify again whether the transformation was successful and prepared to  performing another ligation.
The  bacterial liquid had fluorescence, both of them! This exciting news had raised  our hope. Isolated the plasmids and digested for restrict analysis. The result  indicated that one of the bacterial culture was correct! So added 100 μL  aliquot into LB, attempting to make bacterial glycerol stocks. However, strange  thing was that liquid culture had not illuminated! Added another 100μL  aliquot into LB and put two LB in the shaker at 37°C.
Week 16: July 23rd to July 29th
Monday,  July 23rd
Experiments:
Isolated  the plasmid of original correct bacterial in 21th and two liquid culture in  22nd from the original one. Ran on a gel for restriction analysis. The result  was beyond belief: only the band of  original one was correct, but it seemed that once we add 100μL  aliquot of original bacteria into new LB, the band went wrong. We cannot figure  out why this strange thing could happen.
In the  evening after the team meeting, streaked plate with original 7.21 liquid  culture.
Team  Meeting:
Wang  summarized the experiments in the last week. It was a tough task building the  same two gene circuits again and again. Huang and Yu presented her  communication with 2012iGEM members in Peking University and University of  Science and Technology of China. She pointed out some shining part of them,  which we could learn from and improve our own team. Mo shared his idea on an  article he read and discussed the method for determining the fluorescent  intensity. Chi showed the progress in Human Practice: we had prepared abundant  materials and waiting for Xie's return. Fan and Yan proposed their design in  wiki and mascot, and everyone were so exciting when discussing how mascot  should be like.
Tuesday,  July 24th
Experiments:
Isolated  the plasmid and ran on a gel for restriction analysis.
Made PBS  for determining the fluorescence.
Wednesday,  July 25th
Experiments:
Added  1mL aliquot into 200mL new LB and put in the shaker at 37°C. After  2 hours of shaking, added 2.7mL arabinose to each liquid culture. Determined  the fluorescence value and OD600 every hour. We all learned how to use the  equipment. The values of unstable GFP were too low, which made us very nervous:  those circuits we spent so much time to made might become nonsense in a second!  We quickly isolated the plasmid for restriction analysis and ran on a gel. The  result indicated that the bacterial glycerol stocks may be contaminated, which  turned out to be the best bad news for us.
Thursday,  July 26th
Experiments:
Goal: To  do another ligation of constructive promoter and RBS-tetR-TT once again, to  verify the streak plate.
Isolated  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for ligation was perfect: the band was  neat and clear. However, that for analysis was not really good. After gel  extraction, did gel ligation and put it in 4°C, waiting  for transformation.
Design:
Mo, Qiu  and Yan managed to sewed a sample of our mascot. They brought needles, thread, cloth  magnet and cotton to lab. Qiu even wore a rubber glove, claiming that a  stronger friction force could be helpful in sewing, or maybe she was just used  to wear it when performing experiments.
 
Friday,  July 27th
Experiments:
Goal: To  verify if all the glycerol stocks of PBAD-RBS-gfp(LVA)-TT are still  correct.
Since we  had found the high risk of mutation for liquid culture due to the transfer of  culture, another method for preserving was badly needed. Also we should verify  if the glycerol stocks are still remain the same.
Isolated  the plasmid for restriction analysis then ran on a gel. The result indicated  that three of four stocks had the possibility being wrong. Streaked a plate  from the right one.
Design:
Mascot  had almost finished, only problem here was that it cannot sit or stand by  itself. Maybe thicker legs and heavier body can solve this problem.
Saturday,  July 28th
Experiments:
In order  to verify part PcI-RBS-gfp(LVA)-TT and ligate this part to others, did another  digest for restriction analysis and ligation. Sadly, the gel result was still  disappointing: three bands were observed after double digestion. But two of the  bands revealed that they might be correct, yet being contaminated. So Advisor  Wu decided to extract gel with correct bands and perform ligation.
 
Sunday,  July 29th
Experiments:
Still  stuck at PcI!!! Isolated plasmid from the streaking plate from original  transformation one. Digested for restriction analysis and ran on a gel. The  result was still not pleasant. Taking advice from another graduate student  Zheng, diluted the liquid culture in 10-6 and 10-7 times  and spread on LB Agar with Amp.
August
Week 17: July 30th to August 5th
Monday,  July 30th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Goal:  ligate Pcons-RBS-tetR-TT + PtetR
In the  morning, we started on the first try. After plasmid isolation and digestion,  ran on a gel and result was still sad. So we try again in the late afternoon  and performed ligation.
The  colonies in the plate of the previous day grew well, so picked one colony of  each plate and streaked lines at the same time.
Team  Meeting:
Wang  summarized the genetic circuit parts finished last week, and restated the  essentials of attitude and carefulness when conducting experiments. Xie  presented his communication with iGEMers in The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology. He communicated with the team members and have a pleasant  discussion.
Tuesday,  July 31st
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Goal: To  verify all the plate streaked or spread in July 29th.
Isolated  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result was not perfect but still satisfying. One  of the ligation turned out correct.
Sophia sent  everyone an e-mail, pointing out the time limitation and rest tasks of  experiments. The lab team was divided into three groups in charge of digital  monitor, time delay and cell immobilization, respectively.
Wednesday,  August 1st
Experiments:
Goal: To  ligate RBS-tetR-TT with PcI-RBS-gfp(LVA)-TT
Isolated  plasmids and digested for ligation. After running a gel,  bands appeared not having been digested  completely. Still did the ligation anyway.
Cell  Immobilization:
We  started thinking about methods to establish our numeric display device and to  bring our engineering bacteria into operation. Obviously, the foremost thing we  should do is to fix the engineering bacteria from freely suspended cultivation  to the tubes of our device, namely cell immobilization. Meanwhile, cultivation  condition and fluorescence intensity of immobilized cells should be made  certain.
After  studying literatures and asking senior students for help, we decided to explore  three kinds of methods of immobilizing our engineering bacteria: 1) calcium  alginate beads; 2) PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules, 3)  intra-hollow  Ca-alginate capsules.
 
Thursday,  August 2nd
Experiments:
Goal: To  verify Part I and perform ligation if Part I is right.
Isolated  plasmids and digested both for restriction analysis and ligation. The result  was so upsetting: the construction of Part I was still unsuccessful. Better try  another ligation next day.
Cell  Immobilization:
Added  100uL PBAD-RGT aliquot into LB medium with Ampicillin，37°C shaker  incubated for 12h.
Goal: To  test if PDMDAAC will restrain growth of the engineering bacteria.
As the  graph shows, In the first 90 min, OD was relatively high ( in a normal value),  but then it declined dramatically. 
Friday,  August 3rd
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Goal: To  build Part I
Plasmids  isolation, digestion and gel extraction all went smoothly. Part II-III-IV was  correct.
Cell  Immobilization:
Goal: To  prepare calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PBAD-RGT.
Prepared:  3% sodium alginate solution; 0.05 mol/L CaCl2 solution; sterile water.
Centrifuged  the cultivated sample for 1min at 6000rpm to collect the deposit (about 2~3g).  Resuspend the cells with sterile water and centrifuge for 1min at 6000rpm，and drained off the  supernatant. Mixed the cells with sterile water in a mass ratio of 1:2, then  added equivalent volume of sodium alginate solution, mixing thoroughly.
Drew  the  mixture in a 10mL injector, then  dropped it one by one through the pinhead into 100mL  CaCl2 solution,  stirring at the same time. Laid it aside for  2 hours. Then drained off  the CaCl2  solution and rinsed the calcium alginate beads with sterile water for 2 or 3  times. Added 100mL  CaCl2 solution,  soaking the beads overnight.
 
Saturday,  August 4th
Digital  Monitor:
Made  competence BL21 and transformed ligation product of the previous day.
Cell  Immobilization:
Goal: To  prepare Sodiumcellu-losesulfate(NaCS) for making PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules.
Today we  started learning to prepare NaCS, with the help of a senior.
Prepared:  sulfuric acid and ethanol solution(1.51:1) maintained at 0℃; dry absorbent co/p> tton maintained at 60℃; industrial alcohol; deionized water; NaOH  solution.
Immersed  4g  dry absorbent cotton in the solution  in ice-bath for 66 min. Then squeezed out the solution and rinsed the reacted  linters with alcohol in draught cupboard. Put it in 400mL deionized water and  regulated pH to about 3. Stirred and dissolved it for 10 min then filtrated it.  Collected the filtrate and regulated pH to 9.3 accurately. Added industrial  alcohol, 1~1.5 times of the filtrate, until there appeared white retiary  floccule. Centrifuged the floccule for 5 min at 5,000rpm and collected it. 65°C drying  for more than 24 h.
Time  delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of RBS-GFP-TT with the biobricks RBS1.0 and GFP-TT which we  already have.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for analysis was not good for the bands  of RBS were not clear. The result for ligation was not good for there are four  bands of GFP-TT, two of them are correct. So we extracted gel and did gel  ligation and put it in 4°C,  waiting for transformation.
 Sunday,  August 5th
Digital  Display:
Goal:  ligate Part III-IV and Part V-IV
Cell  Immobilization:
PBAD-RGT  beads emitted fluorescence.
Prepared  calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PcI-RLT.
PcI-RLT  beads emitted fluorescence in CaCl2 solution.
Time  delay:
Pick  single colonies of luxI, luxR, luxpR.
Week 18: August 6th to August 13th
Monday,  August 6th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Goal: To  verify if the transformation is successful and perform ligation once it does.
After  cultivated in liquid LB for 12 hours, bacteria were collected in 1.5mL sterile  tube and isolated plasmids. Digested for both restriction analysis and ligation  then ran on a gel. The image showed that transformation was almost successful,  still two of them appeared to be contaminated. We hope those extra bands were  due to some careless mistakes during isolation process, not transformation.
Cell  Immobilization:
Transferred  the PcI-RLT  beads into  LB medium with Ampicillin, 37°C shaker  incubated.
PcI-RLT beads  emitted fluorescence, which revealed more obvious under ultraviolet light. The  fluorescence didn’t trail off after cultivated for several hours.
Goal: To  prepare PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules.
Got 2.17  g NaCS.
Before  making the microcapsules, we prepared 6% PDMDAAC solution and NaCS solution  (the concentration was not sure ). For ensuring the concentration of NaCS solution we need, firstly we dissolved 0.4 g in 20mL deionized water,82°C water  bath, and gradually added NaCS to make it more dense and more viscous. It was  really a time-consuming process to Dissolve NaCS completely.
Time  delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of luxI-TT and luxR-TT. Analysis TT, luxpR, luxR, luxI
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for ligation was not good for the bands  of TT were not clear. Change the ligation system: adding 2µL digested vector-TT  and 6µL digested insert-luxI and luxR.
The  result for ligation was not good for there are four bands of luxI and luxR,  both two of them are correct. So we extracted gel and did gel ligation and put  it in 4°C, waiting for transformation.
The  transformation of RBS-GFP-TT was failed.
Team  Meeting:
Sophia presented  experiments progress of cell digital display and plan for this week: to finish  construction of all the devices. Qiu introduced their ideas and project for  time-delay display. Hu made a brief review of principles in cell  immobilization. As for the method, they preferred sodium alginate(SA), which is  natural and less toxic to cells. Moson gave an brief introduction about recent  progress and remained issued, such as exhibition venue, typesetting, potential  sponsors.
Hu:  immobilized cell

Que  Huang:
She  presented several edition of logo and team name. Still many works left for  design group. Wu asked them to finish design of logo and name in several days.
Tuesday,  August 7th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Today  was a TERRIBLE day for experiments. After restriction analysis, all bands  seemed to be correct, which cheered up everyone. However, another gel for  ligation was abysmal. Six bands were observed after double digestion! Maybe  enzyme was contaminated or added wrongly. Only thing we could do was to start  all over again.
Cell  Immobilization:
Got  approximate 5% NaCS solution. Put the 6% PDMDAAC solution on a magnetic stirrer  and stirred it at a certain speed, maintaining a small eddy in the center of  liquid surface. Then dropped the NaCS solution into the fringe of the eddy by a  1mL injector. The drop then formed a spheroidic membrane. And if the rotating  speed was too high, that spheroidicity will be torn and destroyed. The denser  the NaCS solution is, the harder the microcapsules are destroyed.
After testing,  we decided to dissolve more NaCS, until approximate 7%.
Time  delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of luxpR-RBS-GFP-TT and reanalysis luxI and luxR.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for luxI is good, but had some bands  behind the correct band of luxR in the single digestion analysis.
The  result for ligation was not good for gel extract.
Design:
Brainstorming  based on ideas we had in weekly meeting. The team’s name was mainly discussed.  Several new ideas had been the focus. And the one, E.lomoile, became the final  team name.
Wednesday,  August 8th
Digital  display:
Ligate  Part II-III-IV and V-IV, I and II-III-IV, V and I, V-II and III-IV-I-IV.
Time  delay: ligate luxPR and RGT
Today  was quite BUSY! The number of tubes prepared for plasmid isolation raised up to  24! We had to divided them into two groups and perform isolation separately.  Gel for restriction analysis was a disaster! Only one sample seemed to be right,  whereas others were terribly wrong. Maybe the workload was too heavy to prevent  any mistake, or maybe the bacteria were so naughty not cooperating with us. Wu  advised us to decrease workload and perform ligation in a higher quality  standard. In the evening, Hu wanted to do another restriction analysis using  the same bacteria as morning's. We REALLY want to know why gel looked like  that. Fortunately, the bands were closer to Mr. Right, though several wrong  bands could be observed. Wang decided to give up glycerol stocks and reduce the  workload, hoping to make all things correct.
Cell  Immobilization:
After  getting the NaCS solution in a proper concentration, we started to make the  microcapsules entrapping engineering bacteria with plasmid PcI-RLT.
Centrifuged  10mL sample and collected the deposit. Added 10mL NaCS solution and mixed it thoroughly  with the cells. Put the 6% PDMDAAC solution on a magnetic stirrer and stirred  it at a certain speed, maintaining a small eddy in the center of liquid  surface. Then dropped the mixture into the fringe of the eddy by a 1mL injector  until it formed a spheroidic membrane. It took 10 min to react and completely  form microcapsules. After that, we tipped all microcapsules to a strainer and  rinsed it with sterile water. Then transferred all microcapsules  into  LB medium with Ampicillin, 37°C shaker incubated  at 100rpm.
The  new-made microcapsules were filled and translucent. But after 4 hours the  culture solution appeared turbid, showing that there were some microcapsules broke  and bacteria leaked into the medium.
Time  delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of luxpR-RBS-GFP-TT and analysis luxpR and luxR.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result of analysis for luxpR and luxR is wrong.
Reanalysis  2M19,the result is correct.
The  transformation of luxI-TT and luxR-TT were successful.
Design:
We had a  meeting to discuss the logo and designed several new versions.
 Thursday,  August 9th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Transferred  the ligation product of the previous day and spread it. Isolated plasmid in  order to ligate with product from gel extraction of the previous day. All  things ran well, which made us feel extremely relived. Also picked colonies of  plates of August 5th, and isolated plasmid for restriction analysis. Gel was  perfect, clear bands and no other unwanted thing. So the rest of plasmids were  available for ligation in the next day.
In order  to verify all the glycerol stocks of PBAD and PBAD-RBS-cI-TT,  added 100uL aliquot to LB medium separately and shake in  37°C.
Time  delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of RBS1.0-luxI-TT, luxpR-RBS-GFP-TT.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The analysis of RBS1.0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.07, luxI-TT,  2M19 were correct so we extracted RBS1.0 luxI-TT, 2M19 to do the ligation of  RBS1.0-luxI-TT, luxpR-RBS-GFP-TT.
Design:
We  decided the formal one of the logo.
Friday,  August 10th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Isolated  plasmid and digested for restriction analysis. Also digest the plasmid for  ligation, which verified in the previous day. In the afternoon, almost every  member went to a presentation delivered by Professors from Taiwan. Before we  left, Wu set up a program which supposed to automatically shut down the  electrophoresis apparatus after 30 minutes.  However, it did not work!! Gel kept running for 48 minutes until Ma  figured out something wrong. We came back, nervous and regretful. Anyway, brought  gel to take a photo. Fortunately, it seemed that Ma's timely pause prevented a  disaster: the bands were just around the border. PBAD was correct,  another gel was extracted for ligation. With great regret, Wu decided to  isolate plasmids personally and ran another gel to get better a electrophoresis  photo.
Cell  Immobilization:
Goal: To  determine a PcI-RLT standard curve.
1000mL  LB medium with 1 mLAmp+ 55 mL PcI-RLT aliquot.
From 0 h  on, took and collected 1mL sample in Eppendorf tube per hour, storing at 4°C. Repeatedly operated until the 12th  hour. Determined each sample's OD value.
From 4 h  on, took 10mL sample, centrifuged for 3min at 6000 rpm and collected the  deposit cells, storing at 4°C.Repeatedly  operated until the 10th hour. 65°C drying to completely dry,  then measured each sample's dry weight.
The OD  curve seemed to be normal, but the dry weight and OD values were not showing an  obvious linear relationship. Through analysis, we considered the error might be  brought in the drying process. We didn't have all samples drying for an  equivalent period of time.
Time  delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of RBS0.6-luxI-TT, RBS0.07-luxI-TT, RBS0.3-luxI-TT
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. Cause we had analysis RBS0.6, RBS0.3, RBS0.07 and  luxI-TT yesterday and the result for ligation was good, we extracted gel and  did the ligation.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel for next day as well.RBS0.01 and luxR-TT was right.
Design:
We met  for uniform design and got preliminary schemes.
 
Saturday,  August 11th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Continue  the construction, Isolation, digestion and ligation. Also made 8 tubes of  competence BL21.
Cell Immobilization:
Prepared  calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PcI-RLT.
PcI-RLT  beads emitted fluorescence in CaCl2 solution.
Prepared  NaCS solution (0.7706g in 15mL deionized water) and tested its concentration.
Result:  The concentration was too low so that the spheroidic membranes were easily torn.  So we decided to dissolve more NaCS.
Time  delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of RBS0.01-luxI-TT, RBS1.0-luxI-TT, and do the ligaion of  RBS1.0-luxR-TT again.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel, RBS1.0 was correct but little. LuxR-TT and luxpR2M19  were correct. The target gene of luxI-TT was too little to be seen, we did not  extract it.
The  transformation of RBS1.0-luxI-TT was failed but luxpR-RBS-GFP-TT was correct.
Design:
We  finished the first draft.
Sunday,  August 12th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Today  went smoothly, except for the plates of the previous day. We cannot figure out  why no colonies could be observed in some plates, while others grew well.  Competence cells were made in the same time. Wang looked up all the possible  reasons and was perturbed about the competence cells she made and  transformation procedure. To find where the problem is, she did a positive  control using the remained competence cells.  If the positive control does not produce the expected result, there may  be something wrong with the experimental procedure, and the experiment is  repeated.
Cell  Immobilization:
Goal: To  prepare NaCS.
Result:  After 66min's reaction, we didn't completely squeeze out all the reaction  liquid from the reacted linters, therefore the subsequent processes were  impeded. At last we didn't get proper production.
Time  delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of RBS0.3-luxI-TT.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The transformation of RBS1.0-luxI-TT,  RBS0.6-luxI-TT, RBS0.3-luxI-TT, RBS0.07-luxI-TT, RBS0.01-luxI-TT and  RBS1.0-luxR-TT were failed before,  we do  the ligation again. Cause RBS0.3 was stored at -20℃, we only isolate plasmids of luxI-TT.
The  transformation of RBS0.6-luxI-TT, RBS0.07-luxI-TT and RBS0.3-luxI-TT were  failed.
Design:
Other  drafts were finished. Other details of the uniform had been sure.
 
 Week 19: August 13th to 20th
Monday,  August 13th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Another  sad day for the lab. No colonies can be observed in the transformation plate  except for positive control. If the problem was not competence BL21 or  transformation process, ligation is to blame for the failure. For another part,  isolated plasmid and digest for restriction analysis. The electrophoresis photo  indicated the failure of ligation. Since the part get longer, there is a great  chance of unsuccessful ligation.
Wang  found water has leaked into some plates preserved close to the wall of the 4°C  refrigerator. It seemed that parafilm was not so airtight and waterproof as we  thought. She took out them and streaked the plate once again.
Time-delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of PBAD-RBS-luxI-TT and PBAD-RBS-luxR-TT and analyze  luxpR-2M19.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for analysis was correct but not fully  cut. As for extraction, the bands of luxpR-2M19 were correct and clear to be  extracted.
The  transformation of RBS0.01-luxI-TT, RBS1.0-luxI-TT, RBS1.0-luxR-TT and  RBS0.3-luxI-TT were failed.
Cell  Immobilization:
Goal: To  prepare NaCS.
Result:  After adding alcohol, some white floccule appeared on the top of the solution,  and it gradually separated to  several  layers. The upper layer was retiary floccule, the second layer was transparent  liquid, and the third layer appeared to be cloud form floccule (It might be  production whose chains were shorter than normal length).  Centrifuged and collected the upper retiary  floccule, 65°C  drying.
Design:
We  decided the uniform design in the weekly full meeting and discussed the wiki  design proposals.
Team  meeting:
Sophia  presented the experimental progress. Have finished all the parts and some  ligation between parts. Fluorescence test would be determined by SpectraMax M5  Multi-Mode Microplate Readers(Molecular Devices). She reiterated that group  leaders should send her daily report in time.
Shuqin  introduced their work on cell immobilization last week. Two method, calcium  alginate and NACS PDNDAAC microcapsule, were performed at the same time. They  will finish CAD drawing of equipment next week. Yunxin presented the journal  her wrote about their group. She also referred paper research on unstable GFP.  Wu thought more research were needed, especially on those iGEM teams who had  experience on unstable GFP. It takes about one week to prepare the NACS. Wu  pointed out that we should succeed in cell immobilization first, then to  consider improvement methods. Some preparation tests will help the next stage  works.
Muxin  showed her works on team description. Some members still haven’t handed in  their personal description. Moson delivered his presentation in English. Maybe  we all should try this next time. Youbin mentioned about his ideas about  fluorescence test. Rong presented achievement on design. T-shirt template have  been finished. Design on wiki still keeps on going.
Tuesday,  August 14th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Ligated  circuit B in 16°C for another try using the remained ligation product. After 4  hours, transferred into competence BL21 and spread on plates. In case of the  second failure of ligation, incubated genetic parts for another isolation & ligation cycle. To eliminate interference from competence cell, positive and  negative controls were conducted at the same time.
Time-delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of luxR-TT-luxpR-RBS-GFP-TT.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for analysis was correct and for ligation  was good, we extracted gel and did gel ligation and put it in 4°C, waiting for  transformation.
The  ligation of PBAD-RBS-luxI-TT and PBAD-RBS-luxR-TT were failed.
Cell Immobilization:
Goal: To  determine a PBAD-RLT standard curve.
400mL LB  medium with 400uLAmp+ 2mL PBAD-RLT aliquot , started at 8:56.
From 0 h  on, took and collected 1mL sample in Eppendorf tube per hour, storing at 4°C.  Repeatedly operated until the 13th hour. Determined each sample's OD value.
From 4 h  on, took 10mL sample, centrifuged for 3min at 6000 rpm and collected the  deposit cells, storing at 4°C.Repeatedly operated until the 13th hour. 65°C drying  for 12 hours and then measured each sample's dry weight.
The OD  curve was not a smooth S-Curve. The sampling process might bring some error to  the determination.
Casting  out the last three interferential OD values, the association degree of standard  curve  is 0.92.
Design:
We  engaged in Wiki design and finished the drafts. 
Wednesday,  August 15th
Experiments:
Digital  Display:
Still no  colonies on the transformation plate and control groups all behaved in a normal  manner. Maybe ligase or buffer was contaminated or became inactive. We changed  ligase and buffer and hope for the best. Put the mixture in 4°C for 16 hours.
Time-delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of RBS0.01-luxI-TT, RBS0.07-luxI-TT, RBS0.3-luxI-TT,  RBS0.6-luxI-TT.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for analysis was correct and for ligation  was good, we extracted gel and did gel ligation and put it in 4°C, waiting for  transformation.
Cell  Immobilization:
Goal: To  prepare NaCS.
Result:  After adding alcohol, some white retiary floccule appeared on the top of the  solution. Centrifuged and collected the upper floccule, 65°C  drying.
Prepared  calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PBAD-RLT.
The NaCS  production made on August 13th presented to be tawny, and dissolved more  rapidly, But the solution was less stringy than it should be. So we judged the  production was impure.
Device  construction:
Prepared  7 glass tubes (inner diameter 10mm) with rubber plugs, 14 glass adapters (inner  diameter 5mm) and an Expanded Polystyrene board. Perforate the board and  roughly established our device.
 
Thursday,  August 16th
Digital  Display:
Transferred  the ligation products and spread them on the plates. To find out where the  problem is, Wang decided to conduct another two controlled experiments to  verify two things: completeness of double digestion of backbones, efficiency of  competence BL21.
Time-delay:
Goal: To  do the preparation for ligation of RBS0.01-luxI-TT, RBS0.07-luxI-TT,  RBS0.3-luxI-TT,
Isolate  plasmids of luxI-TT and luxR-TT. Do the ligation of RBS0.01-luxI-TT,  RBS0.07-luxI-TT, RBS0.3-luxI-TT and did the transformation 4 hours later.
Cell  Immobilization:
Transferred  the PBAD-RLT  beads into  20mL LB medium with Ampicillin, 37°C shaker  incubated. However the quantity of PBAD-RLT beads was too small, and  they were not of uniform size, so we abandon them.
Again,  prepared calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PBAD-RLT.
 
Friday,  August 17th
Digital  Display:
In the  morning, we sensed different when coming into the lab: an air of colonies!!!  Though there were only a part of the plates with growing colonies, we still  felt inspired. Picked one colonies of each plates into LB medium and put in the  shaker for the verification this night. Also streaked plates using several  randomly selected colonies.
Terrible  nightmare in the evening: colonies we picked all turned out to be  false-positive. We had no idea where the problem was.
Time-delay:
Goal: To  do the analysis of luxR-luxpR-2M19 and RBS0.01-luxI-TT and do the ligation of PBAD-RBS-luxR-luxpR-2M19.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for analysis of luxR-luxpR-2M19 was  wrong, so we did not extract gel. And the result for ligation of luxR-TT and  luxpR-2M19 was clear and correct so we extracted gel and did gel ligation and  put it in 16℃, did the  transformation 4 hours later.
The  ligation of luxRTT-luxpR2M19 was wrong.
Cell  Immobilization:
Transferred  the PBAD-RLT  beads into  20mL LB medium with Ampicillin, and added 2mL  Ara 37°C shaker  ( 50r/min)incubated.
Prepared  NaCS, 65°C drying.
Prepared  calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PcI-RLT.

Saturday,  August 18th
Digital  Display:
Another  awful day: We were deeply suspicious of ligation process, especially of ligase  and buffer. So we lent these from lab 571 and added into remained gel  extraction product. Wu still clung to the hope that the plate with colonies  could not all be false-positive - they had probability to be right. He picked  ten colonies into LB medium and wished for the best.
Time-delay:
Goal: To  do the analysis of RBS0.3-LuxI-TT.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for analysis of RBS0.3-luxI-TT was wrong.
Did the  ligation of and luxR-TT to test the T4 DNA ligation liquid cause luxR-TT had  been successful linked before.
Cell  Immobilization:
Filled  the PcI-RLT beads in the glass tubes of our device, and tried to applied a  fed-batch culture with a peristaltic pump.
Sunday,  August 19th
Digital  Display:
After  isolation of plasmids and gel running, the electrophoresis showed that all the  colonies picked from transformation plates were false-positive. It seemed that  backbones haven't digested completely and ligated into circles again.  Therefore, maybe the problem is double  digestion.
Time-delay:
Goal: To  find the problem.
The  ligations of luxR-TT, PBADRBS-luxRTT and luxRTT-luxpR2M19 were  failed.
Cell  Immobilization:
Prepared  calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PcI-RLT (glycerin  tube) and with PcI-RLT (single colony) .
Design:
We  confirmed the frame, color scheme and more details of the Wiki and engaged  completing the former scheme. The arrangement of the homepage was changed to be  more simple and clear. A photo gallery was made.
 Week 20: August 20th to August 26th
Monday,  August 20th
Digital  Display:
Ligation  again, using new endonuclease. Incubated another two parts, preparing for the  ligation of the next day.
Cell  Immobilization
Tested  NaCS solution's concentration and prepared materials for our device  construction.
Time  Delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of RBS0.6-luxITT.
Use the  new T4 DNA ligase but the old Agarose Gel Extraction kit.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for analysis was not good because there  were too many bands beside the correct bands. And the result for extraction was  clear and good so we did the gel extract and did the ligation of RBS0.6-luxITT  and put it in 16°C.
Design:
We  discussed all work of last week and made a plan of next week. Several  principles were emphasized again.
  
Tuesday,  August 21st
Digital  Display:
Another  ligation. Transferred ligation product of the previous day.
Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Goal: To  prepare NaCS.
Result:  After adding alcoholm, some white retiary floccule appeared on the top of the  solution.Centrifuged and collected the upper floccule, 65°C  drying.
Time  Delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of PBADRBS-luxITT and PBADRBS-luxRTT
Transform  the ligation of RBS0.6-luxITT and isolate plasmids of luxITT and luxRTT. Cause  cells with PBADRBS wasn’t much enough to be isolate, we just did gel  extract of luxITT and luxRTT. The bands of luxITT and luxRTT were correct and  clear. Put them in 16°C.
Wednesday,  August 22nd
Digital  Display:
A  graduate, researching in molecular bio in Lab 571, has conducted ligation  successfully in the previous day. To verify whether the isolation kit or other  factors in our lab were alright, we divided into two groups and conduct  experiments in both lab 580 and 571. Misfortunes never come singly:  electrophoresis photo indicated that isolation, which had never caused any  problem before, all turned to be failed!
Time  Delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of  RBS0.01-LuxITT, PBADRBS-luxITT  and PBADRBS-LuxRTT.
Use the  new High Purity Plasmid Miniprep Kit.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for analysis of RBS0.01 was correct so  did the gel extract and did the ligation of RBS0.01-luxITT, PBADRBS-luxITT  and PBADRBS-luxRTT. Did two ligations of PBADRBS-luxRTT,  one is put in 4°C and the other is in 16°C to test the effect of ligase.
Fluorescence  Test:
Fluorescence  measurements were designed to determine the top values of fluorescence and the  time when the value of fluorescence fall. We set a group of inducers included  four high levels of arabinose concentration in today’s fluorescence  measurements of PBADRLT. Measurements were taken in a time interval of 15  minutes. We got a series of data containing 18 groups of value in every level.  These data was enough for us to get four curves of fluorescence.
Thursday,  August 23rd
Digital  Display:
Today is  the Chinese traditional Valentine's Day, but we had no mood for it.
Original  plan is to perform the controlled experiments again to verify the ligation  procedure is alright. Bad things happened again: no bands in electrophoresis  photo. Maybe the plasmid isolation kits were contaminated or something wrong  with purification columns. The band of RETPcIRLT seemed strange, maybe need  another ligation.
Made  competence DH5α. Wang changed the rotational speed from  6000rmp to 4000rpm. Then transferred the ligation products of the previous day  and spread plates.
Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Prepared  calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PBAD-RLT.
Prepared  NaCS, 65°C  drying.
Time  Delay:
Goal: To  do the ligation of  RBS0.01-luxITT, PBADRBS-luxITT,  PBADRBS-luxRTT and luxpR-2M19.
Transform  the plasmids of  RBS0.01-luxITT, PBADRBS-luxITT  and PBADRBS-luxRTT into DH5α.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The bands could not be seen.
Friday,  August 24th

To  ligate RET and PcIRLT once again, conducting controlled experiments to verify  whether purification column is reliable. Unfortunately, it is solution that is  making trouble, rather than columns. So we ended up with barely nothing. One  shocking news happened in the late evening: verification of transformation  plates all turned to be correct! Got so excited!
Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Rinsed PBAD-RLT  beads and transferred them into 20mL LB culture medium, adding 20uL Amp. 37°C shaker  50rpm incubated. After 2 hours, added 2mL Ara.
Put 5 PBAD-RLT  beads and 1mL culture fluid into an Eppendorf tube, storing at 4°C.
After  adding Ara and incubating for 7h, 8h, put 5 PBAD-RLT beads and 1mL  culture fluid into an Eppendorf tube.
Determined  each sample's fluorescence intensity.
Result:
0h  sample's fluorescence intensity was the least, 8h>7h.
The  fluorescence intensity is related to the amount of beads.
Because  some of the bacteria leaked into the medium, the background fluorescence  intensity brings a significant influence to the measuring.

Experiment:
Goal: To  test the fluorescence intensity of PBAD-RLT beads.
Transferred  the PBAD-RLT  beads into  20mL LB medium with Ampicillin, 37°C shaker  ( 50r/min)incubated.
After 2  hours, added 2mL Ara. Took 5 PBAD-RLT beads and rinsed them  with PBS, then Started  fluorescence test  (exciting laser intensity: 485 nm, emitting laser intensity: 520 nm). Tested on  0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 4h, 5h, 6h.
Problem:  There was a little difficulty taking out the beads without breaking them,  therefore the time we need to collect sample was prolonged.
When  first taken out, PBAD-RLT  beads emitted very low fluorescence.  After a while in plates, the fluorescence became stronger.
Maybe  the GFP proteins inside the bead emit fluorescence only after they are exposed  to enough oxygen. When the beads are in the medium, the dissolved oxygen is  relatively insufficient due to the low rotating speed.
Prepared  a large number of blank calcium alginate beads.
Prepared  calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PBAD-RLT.

Goal: To  do the ligation of PBAD-RBS0.6 and PBAD-RBS0.07.
Isolate  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for analysis was correct. Cause the bands  of PBAD hardly to be seem, we increased the volume of PBAD when ligation.
Fluorescence  Test:
We  changed the arabinose concentration from high levels to lower ones according to  last fluorescence measurements of PBADRLT. Besides, we took some  kinetic curves in all concentration levels we had taken before for comparison.  The analysis of these data will help us improve our efficiency in the coming  fluorescence measurements

Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Goal: To  test the fluorescence intensity of PBAD-RLT beads.
Each  well contained 5 beads. Ara: 20 uL, 50 mM
As the  graph shows, beads emitted approximate intensity of fluorescence when  cultivated for 10h, no matter what time Ara was added. So we can add Ara after  beads were transferred into culture medium for 3 h in our later experiments.
Device  construction:
Filled  the tubes with beads and tested the properties of tubes using a peristaltic  pump to pump water through the tubes,
Finding:  The flow of the pump was too small and the flow was blocked badly in tubes.  Each tubes had different resistance to water, thus the flow in each tubes was  different. While blasting air through tubes, an upright tube would   make air pass easier. Also, the flow should  not be too fast, otherwise the beads will rush to one side and plug up the  tube.

Fluorescence  Test:
Since  the analytical result from kinetic curves we had taken on last Sunday, we  lowered the level of inducer concentration once again. But curves of  fluorescence measurements in this time show something different from last ones.  There are still remarkable fluctuations of parallel samples. These phenomena  might result from the unstable and nonairtight environment in the SpectraMax M5  that obviously decreased the volume of Basal Medium.

Experiment:
Filled a  tube with beads, then pumped LB culture medium in and out of the tube with a  peristaltic pump.
Prepared  calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PBAD-RLT,  then put the beads into a black ELISA plate, Started cultivation and  determination at 21:30 and ended at 9:30. (37°C,  exiting laser intensity: 485nm, emitting laser intensity:520nm, Ara 50mM)
Wells:
A1-A5  200uL LB+ Amp                                 A6-A10 200uL LB+ Amp+ beads
B1-B5 200uL  LB+Amp+beads+5uLAra      B6-B10 200uL  LB+Amp+beads+10uLAra
C1-C5 200uL  LB+Amp+beads+20uLAra    C6-C10 200uL  LB+Amp+beads+20uLAra
D1-D5  beads+20uLAra                                D6-D10 200uL  LB+Amp+20uLAra
There  was no obvious difference in the intensity of fluorescence, despite different  concentration gradients of Arabinose . The intensity of fluorescence that could  be tested was very low.
 
The  fluorescence increased at first and fade gradually. Maybe Ca-Alginate beads  without LB medium can live and product green fluorescence protein in Arabinose.
Fluorescence  Test:
 We  took fluorescence measurements in a time interval of 15 minutes in the same  gradient as last test. Although every curve still kept a good tendency, they  showed that top values were totally low. We thought the new plate with week  colonies should take the blame after a discussion. By now, on the other hand,  we have gotten enough data so that we can determine the most suitable level of  arabinose concentration.

When  Sophia add 100μL aliquot DH5α liquid culture to new LB medium, she also performed a negative control by  adding same aliquot to LB with Amp. But after 1h45min incubation, the negative  control turned opaque. So she had no choice but to give up newly made  competence cells, using the one made two weeks ago to instead, which preserved  in -80ºC. We held little hope for this transformation.

Sunday,  September 2nd
Digit  Display:
After  discussion with Mrs. Wu, we thought that it is inappropriate to use BL21 during  the whole construction process. Strains should first be in DH5α and assemble  together.
Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Transferred  the PBAD-RLT and PcI-RLT capsules into 20mL LB medium  separately and cultivated them for 12 hours. Put 200uL 500mM Arabinose solution  into the PBAD-RLT culture medium  at the second hour. 
Results:  Both  capsules embedding the bacteria with PBAD-RLT  and with PcI-RLT  were not fluorescent, and the culture medium were turbid, telling that some  bacteria had leaked from the capsules.
Prepared intra-hollow  Ca-alginate capsules with E.coli with plasmid PBAD-RLT .
Results:  The capsules were trailing, not as spherical as we supposed them to be. After  observation and analysis, we considered that the 1.2% w/v CMC solution and 2%  w/v CaCl2 solution mixture had changed its structure after autoclaving,  and the viscosity and density of the cationic mixture had decreased. So  the way of sterilization should be modified.
Fluorescence  Test:
We chose  certain levels of Arabinose concentration after analyzing the data we had  gotten from experiments before to set a new gradient. In this time, we used a  stronger colony from a new plate with revived strain. As we expected,  fluorescence intensity of all samples kept at higher levels than ones of  experiment on Wednesday. Both top value and the time when it appears of every  sample with specific arabinose concentration are almost parallel with previous  ones. Besides, we also used a new type of clear plate with a cap to take  kinetic fluorescence measurements with the same gradient of arabinose  concentration after we finished interval test.  But curves showed us an unsatisfying result – top values were totally  low and tendencies of fluorescence intensity were not obvious. We thought the  cap of the plate made the strain grew in an oxygen-limited environment so that  green fluorescence proteins could not be oxided So far, tests about fluorescence  intensity of the strain with a plasmid called PBADRLT have nearly  been finished.

We came  up with an idea about the mascot race and made a picture to illustrate it.

To  verified whether cell(a,d) is successfully constructed, we picked one colony  from transformation plate and isolate plasmids. After digestion and  electrophoresis, we found the ligation was failed, so ligation was performed  again.

Experiment:
Prepared  intra-hollow  Ca-alginate capsules with distilled water inside.
Tried to  make capsules out of super clean bench. Prepared the cationic solution and the  sodium alginate solution without sterilization, but kept the solution at the  same ratio. Cell suspension was replaced by equal distilled water. Other steps  remain as usual.
Results:  The capsules we made were in perfect round shape, when using the solutions  without autoclaving. Comparing the recent two batches of capsules, new methods  of preparing and sterilization of solutions should be applied.
Fluorescence  Test:
As a new  circuit finished by the group of Time Delay, tests about it were taken today.  We referred to the data we have gotten before for these tests, since this  circuit also includes the PBAD – a promoter which we had also used  as a brick to structure the PBADRLT. We made a mistake that we used the DH5α,  which is good at gene constructions but not protein expressions, instead of  BL21 so that protein expressions of this strain got low levels.
Design:
We  complete the files of the card print and printed some samples of it.
We took  attempts of the demo video and discussed more details.
The  material for costume of mascot race was prepared.
Tuesday,  September 4th
Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Prepared  intra-hollow  Ca-alginate capsules with E.coli with plasmid PBAD-RLT .
Placed  10mL 4% w/v CaCl2 solution and 2.4g CMC powder into two different  200mL beakers. Prepared 100mL 1% w/v sodium alginate solution .
Sterilized  the two beakers (contained CaCl2 solution and CMC powder  respectively) and the alginate solution in an autoclave at 120kPa and 121℃for 20 min.
After  autoclaving, dissolved the CMC powder with 10mL distilled water and mixed  with 10mL 4% w/v CaCl2 solution.
Mixed  1.5mL 4% w/v CaCl2 solution and 1.5mL CMC solution with 0.6mL cell suspension,  then dropped the mixture into vortical sodium alginate solution. 
Results:  The droplets also couldn't be a normal sphere. However, when the mixture of the  same ratio was dropped into 1% w/v alginate solution without autoclaving, the  droplets could form round and transparent capsules.  Even the same  cationic solution with autoclaving still could produce normal  spherical capsules. Therefore, we judged that autoclaving had a  significant impact on sodium alginate solution. The alginate solution through  autoclaving became pale yellow and its viscosity decreased.

Digit  Display:
Big day  for experiment, not a good big however. When discussing our circuits with  Xuesong, we found there might be some problem in construction work. Therefore,  we asked Mrs. Wu's advices. She suggested to use DH5α rather than BL21 as competence cells and to perform ligation again from parts.  BL21 is not a safe choose for storing plasmids, which is a fact that we were  too late to realize. That means we are going to have a tough time, much tougher  than before.
Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Prepared  intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsules with plasmid PcI-RLT.
Result:  The capsules were spherical and droplets rarely stuck together. But they didn't  emit fluorescence as well as they were supposed to. Maybe the bacteria sample  didn't carry a steady PcI-RLT and some of the plasmid had lost during the  transfer process. Or we didn't effectively embed the bacteria into the  capsules.
Fluorescence  Test:
While we  were preparing the fluorescence measurements this morning, we found strain – PBADRETPcIRLT4J – falsely expressed in the basal medium. So we canceled today’s  test.

Fluorescence  Test:
We took  a long test from yesterday afternoon to this morning for determining the  fluorescence intensity curves of a strain constructed by the group of Time  Delay. And we designed a gradient with four levels of arabinose concentration – 0, 0.1, 1, 10 mM. Data from this test would be references for our next test  about other homogeneous strains. In general, data gave no distinct connection  between arabinose concentration and values of fluorescence intensity. And  curves pointed that we could use a lower level of arabinose concentration in  next tests.

Fluorescence  Test:
Since  our Molecular Device only can measure the OD600 in limited range, we changed  our protocol of fluorescence measurements as we changed the inducing time to 3  hour after diluting the overnight culture in new medium. From now on, samples  taken from culture should be diluted to 4 times in PBS. Besides, we try to use  the quotient of fluorescence intensity divided by OD600 as Y axis in graphs.  So, we take a fluorescence measurement of the strain called PBADRLT on this new  way today. To our delight, we got a good result.

Today is  the first day when we tested the new circuit named 4J induced by aTc. But  things got not well. According to the experiences, we made a gradient, 4  levels, of aTc concentrations – 0, 0.25, 2.5, 25 mM. All data gave us the only  information that there were no green fluorescence protein expressions in our  cultures. Answers to these questions are under researching and testing.

Fluorescence  Test:
It’s  really a lucky day. We re-designed the method of fluorescence measurements for  PBADRLT and PcIRLT. Fortunately, the result turned to normal  direction. PcIRLTPBADRLT in BL21 finally gave us correct curves  after the third try. In addition, we took all composite circuits of Time Delay  for fluorescence test and we got a good result once again.

Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Prepared  intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsules with plasmid PBAD-RLT and  transferred them to 50 mL LB culture medium with Amp. After the capsules were  prepared, they were shaken for 3 hours and then added Arabinose solution,  measuring the fluorescence of capsules.
Prepared  intra-hollow Ca-anbsp;100mL1%lginate capsules with plasmid PcI-RLT and transferred them to  50 mL LB culture medium with Amp. Right after preparation, started measuring  the fluorescence of the capsules.
Fluorescence  Test:
PtetRLT  was send into BL21 yesterday. This circuit is different in RBS from the 4J.  Today, we not only test its fluorescence but its protein electrophoresis. Two  level of the aTc concentration were used. Results show this circuit working  well. Besides, fluorescence measurements about PBADRETPcIRLT, one  with induction and another without, showed no difference between them.
The  experiment started from the evening and lasted to the next day. We stayed up  late to get samples. Other team members prepared the coming presentation to  Mrs. Wu and Mr. Fang.
Week 25: September 24th to 26th

Cell  Immobilization:
Experiment:
Goal: To  measure the immobilizing capability of the beads/ intra-hollow capsules
Used a  microplate reader to measure the OD value of the culture medium of the  immobilized beads/ intra-hollow capsules.
From the  result, we can find the OD value of the culture medium of beads grown up faster  and higher, indicating that cells immobilized in them leak easier than those  embedded in capsules.
Presentation:
Sophia,  Daniel, Alex and Moson delivered the speech. Mrs. Wu, Mr. Fang, as well as  other graduates have given some valuable advices.
