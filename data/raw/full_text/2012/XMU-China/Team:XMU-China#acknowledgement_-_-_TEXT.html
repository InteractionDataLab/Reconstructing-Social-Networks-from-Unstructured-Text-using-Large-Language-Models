XMU-Acknowledgement
Acknowledgement
All work described on this wiki or on our parts registry pages was done by iGEM Team XMU-China 2012. We managed the whole project, from planning to financing the complete lab work by ourselves. Nevertheless we could not have done all this work without the help, advice and guidance of several people. Therefore, special thanks to the following people:
Our advisor Graduate Xuesong Zheng for helping us in fluorescence test and immobilization.
Prof. Xiaodong Chen for providing us many instruments such as ELISA reader to test the fluorescence and his students Song Huang, Renpan Deng, Xiang You for experimental guidance.
Prof. Yinghua Lu and his student Shiduo Zhang for helping us make the PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules.
Dr. Ying Zeng, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who has provided us with valuable guidance in constructing gene circuits.
