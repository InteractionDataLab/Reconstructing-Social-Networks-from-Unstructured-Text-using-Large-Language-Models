Background  and Approach
1. Logic Gates
A logic  gate is an idealized or physical device implementing a  Boolean function , that is, it performs a logical  operation  on one or more logic inputs and produces a single logic output [1] .

The AIM of our project is to construct a fluorescent  digital display device of genetic circuits with synthetic logic gates. The  finished device will display and switch numbers. Similar to electronic  circuits, logic regulation operation in cells integrates the extracellular and  intracellular signals. We assembled several pairs of promoters and their  activators or repressors into computing building block of the circuit: PBAD-Arabinose, PcI-CI, and Ptet-TetR. These computation  units act as genetic logic gates perform AND, OR and  NOR  gate functions.

2. Green Fluorescent Protein
The green fluorescent  protein (GFP) is a protein composed of 238 amino acid residues (26.9kDa) that  exhibits bright green fluorescence when exposed to light in the blue light wavelength range [2] . Considering that the common types of GFP usually tend to  be very stable and hard to "quench", we chose unstable GFP to make  our device reusable and convert in a fast speed.  This kind of  GFP is tagged with a C-terminal extension that will be recognized  and degraded by tail-specific proteases, leading to a short half-life and fast  degradation of the protein. Degradation rate should be confined at a  suitable range; otherwise the device would either have no light or take a long  time to change numbers.
GFP crystal structure (Ormo, M., Cubitt, AB, Kallio,                         K., Gross, LA, Tsien, RY, Remington, SJ (1996) Science 273, 1392–1395)
(K., Gross, et al. Science, 1996)
3. Cell  Immobilization
It is a  technique to fix cells in a suitable matrix. Immobilized cells have been  employed to perform biotransformation and reported to have higher production  rates than freely suspended cells. In our project, we have selected three  methods to immobilize our engineering bacteria:
(1)Entrapping  cells in calcium alginate beads;
(2)Entrapping  cells in intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsules;
(3)Embedding cells in PDMDAAC-NaCS  microcapsules.
4. Quorum Sensing
It is a method of communication between bacteria that enables  the coordination of group-based behavior based on population density [3] .
(Melissa B. Miller, et al. Annual Review of Microbiology, 2001)
5. Time Delay
Constructing a unique  display device which can let each  unit light up one after another is beneficial for our team to accomplish the aim of  time delay, which means that it is necessary to construct a series of cells  those can express the characteristic of different time delay. As a result, we  take advantage of quorum-sensing system to change the time delay of GFP expression via  different intensity of RBS.
6. Original  Design
In reality, we selected this project from the first brainstorm which was  put forward by the members of Group 2 and its previous name was Bioscreen, as  you see, which turned to be E.lumoli nowadays. To gain more details about the  original task, please link to:

7. Project Overview
Under  usual condition, traditional seven-segment displays acted as a  number “8” need 7 tubes. Through different combinations of the tubes, the  device can display different numbers or characters. Actually most modern  displays are controlled by electric signals which are converted by chemical or  biological signals. But in several situations, especially in detect of trace  amounts or minute amounts of biological signals, we found that it is difficult  to transfer and display the results. Besides, the relevant parameters which are  controlled in real time in some fields of industrial application are hard to be  the same as the reality. The aim of our project is to design a shining synthetic  device for digit or time-course display which can replace the  traditional methods.
Fortunately,  2012 XMU iGEM team has constructed a fluorescent  digital display device with synthetic logic gates, which is able to respond  to signals by displaying and switching numbers. We put GFP equipped with  degradation tags in downstream to illuminate our numbers and change them  quickly as well. Considering our engineering background, we  accordingly employ cell immobilization to build our device. Engineering  bacteria have been embedded in intra-hallow calcium alginate microcapsules and  in PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules respectively. In addition, 3D CAD design is performed  for a perfect device.
Our  genetic circuits vary in length and RBS strength, leading to different durations  of time delay for GFP expression which inspired us to extend our work of 2011  XMU iGEM team. By altering the strength of RBS at five grades, another five  circuits have been built.Once induced by arabinose, the duration of response  time for GFP expression increases as the strength of RBS declines, bringing  about a time-course display.
