XMU-ABSTRACT
Description
E.Lumoli: a shining synthetic  device for digit or time-course display
XMU's 2012 iGEM team has constructed a  fluorescent digital display device with synthetic logic gates, which  is able to respond to signals by displaying and switching numbers. We put GFP equipped  with degradation tags in downstream to illuminate our numbers and change them  quickly as well. Considering our engineering background, we accordingly employ  cell immobilization to build our device. Engineering bacteria have been  embedded in intra-hollow calcium alginate microcapsules and in PDMDAAC-NaCS  microcapsules, respectively. In addition, 3D CAD design is performed for a  perfect device.
Our genetic circuits vary in length and RBS  strength, leading to different durations of time delay for GFP expression. This  inspired us to extend our work last year. By altering the strength of RBS at  five grades, another five circuits have been built. After the induction by arabinose,  the duration of response time for GFP expression increases as the strength of  RBS declines, bringing about a time-course display.
