Accomplishments
1. Digital Display
We  have constructed and characterized a fluorescent digital display device with synthetic  gene circuits,which  is able to respond to signals by displaying and switching number 0 and 1.
We  have designed and constructed a fluorescent digital display device with  synthetic logic gates.
We  have designed and made the physical device for the digital display.
Three-dimensional  graph and visual display of digital animation of the device is also performed  for a perfect device.
2. Cell Immobilization
We  have selected three methods to immobilize our engineering bacteria:
1)  Entrapping cells in calcium alginate beads;
2)  Entrapping cells in intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsules;
3)  Embedding cells in PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules.
We  found that Ca-alginate capsules are perfect fit for our physical device through  which was experimentally validated.We also find that 100rpm, 37℃ is  the suitable cultivation condition for the our engineering cells in the  capsules.
We have  embedded our engineering cells into the intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsule and  characterized them with fluorescent test.
3. Time Delay
We have  constructed and characterized a series of cells with different strength of  RBSes which cause the time delay phenomenon.
We optimized  the concentration of the arabinose for following fluorescent tests. And we finally  chose the 0.1 mM arabinose as the induced concentration.
We  completed the fluorescent test for the series of E.coli. We found that we are able to accomplish the aim of time  delay, suggesting that we can construct a unique display device which can let  each unit light up one after another. We boldly proclaimed that this may be  used to a Biological Screen.
4. Judging Requirements
Bronze:
Team registration - Our team       successfully registered for the iGEM Competition.
Complete Judging Form - To view our       Judging Form please click       here.
Team Wiki - Our team has       successfully designed a wiki page for our project.
Submit at least one new well-characterized standard BioBrick       Part - Our team has submitted several new       parts all of which we have fully characterized.
Silver:
Demonstrate at least one new BioBrick part designed works as       expected - All of our parts have been       carefully tested. Our part BBa_K750000 , BBa_K750009 , BBa_K750010 , BBa_K750012 , BBa_K750103 , BBa_K750104 , BBa_K750107 , BBa_K750108 have been       well characterized.
Enter this information and other documentation on the part's       'Main Page' section of the Registry - The data       relating to our new BioBrick parts have all been added to the Registry.
Gold:
Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part - Our team utilized the BBa_K145280 to develop       and characterize it . Please see the BBa_K750111 for more information.
Outline a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in       Synthetic Biology - we held a theme exhibition       on synthetic biology, entitled Genesis of Synthetic Biology,moreover, We       invited some students from Pinghe First School and Jiyan High School to       our lab ,which give them a chance to have a better understanding of       synthetic biology. On the other hand,We visited several other iGEM teams       all around China during our short semester and summer vacation, including       Peking University, Tianjin University, University of Science & Technology of China, Sun Yat-sen University as well as Hong Kong       University of Science & Technology. Which brought us much closer to  iGEM and has no doubt built a close relationship between the Universities       we visited and Xiamen University iGEM teams.Please click here for more information.
