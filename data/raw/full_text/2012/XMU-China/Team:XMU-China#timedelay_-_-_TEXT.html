Time Delay
1. Overview
For the lengths of our genetic circuits are  not the same, based on quorum sensing system [1] we had studied last year, we considered  that the time of genetic expressions of each circuit is different because of  the different lengths and strength of ribosome binding sites. So we constructed  circuits with three grades strength of ribosome binding sites, including 0.01,  0.6 and 1.0. After induced by arabinose, the duration of response time for GFP  expression increases as the strength of RBS declines, bringing about a  time-course display.
 
2. Review of last year
Last year, we had developed a series of  devices which program a bacteria population to maintain at different cell  densities. [2] We had designed and characterized the genetic circuit  to establish a bacterial ‘population-control’ device in E. coli based on the well-known quorum-sensing system from Vibrio fischeri, which autonomously  regulates the density of an E. coli population. The cell density however was  influenced by the expression levels of a killer gene (ccdB) in our device. As  such, we had successfully controlled the expression levels of CcdB by using  RBSes of different strength and mutated luxR promoters (lux pR). This circuit incorporated a mechanism for programmed death  in respond to changes in the environment.

3. Constructions this year
Figure 2: The construction devices of time delay system
Based on our last year’s project, for convenience of testing the  results of time delay device, we chose GFP instead of CcdB as our reporter. On  the other hand, because of the basal expression of Plac is very strong, we decided to use arabinose to induce PBAD promoter to activate our  device. [4] Meanwhile, to accomplish the aim of time delay, which means we should make  the GFP produce in different period of time, we decided to change the RBS’s  strength of luxI expression system. RBSes of different strengths will cause the  speed of quorum sensing effect, which will lead to the delay of GFP production  time. [5] [6]

4. Results and discussion
4.1 Optimization of inducer concentration
Figure 4: The optimization of  the arabinose concentration added into the TD1.0 including
0, 0.1, 1.0, 10 mM arabinose. [click to data]
We can find that the curve with  0.1 mM arabinose has a higher fluorescence. So we chose the 0.1 mM arabinose for the following fluorescence tests.
4.2  Fluorescent test of the time delay devices
Figure 5: Fluorescence curves of strain TD1.0, TD0.6 and TD0.01
induced         with 0.1 mM arabinose and without arabinose. [click to data]

the control BL21(DE3). [click to data]
Figure  7:The separate time taken up for the three circuits' fluorescent value to reach 5000
after induction, which shows that the stronger RBS circuit contains, the less time it takes.
Compared with the groups absence of  arabinose, the fluorescence of induced groups were much higher. On the other  hand, we could find even the circuit with RBS0.01, the most  insensitive one, also expressed green fluorescence protein without arabinose,  which means basal expressing phenomenon. According to figure 5, when the three  cultures induced by the same concentration of arabinose, the fluorescence of  TD1.0 was the highest, TD0.6 was middle and TD0.01 was the lowest. Finally, as  shown in figure 7, the fluorescence of the circuits with different RBSes also  reached a certain level in different time. It fit the goal of time delay.
