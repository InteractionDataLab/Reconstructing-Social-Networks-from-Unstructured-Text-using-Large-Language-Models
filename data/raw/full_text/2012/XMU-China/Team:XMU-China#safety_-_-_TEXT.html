SAFETY
Researcher, Public and Environmental Safety
The genetic materials used in our  project pose no safety or health concerns to members in the laboratory. There  were certain chemicals and solvents we used in laboratory that are known to be  toxic such as ethidium bromide, but all were treated with proper caution  and care. We strictly followed the BSL-1 requirements. All biological  wastes and equipments that have physical contacts with biological samples were  bleached that was optional and autoclaved before disposal and reuse. If released by accident, our parts and  materials would do some negative damage to the general public. Our BioBrick parts or devices might raise the resistance of Escherichia  coli to certain antibiotics. As we were not conducting large-scale  proliferation of microorganisms, the leakage of the bacteria cultured for  testing experiments would not have significant impact on the general safety of  the environment. However, we strictly followed the BSL-1 requirements as mentioned above and avoided any release of the  BioBrick parts or devices or microorganisms to the environment.
The environment was also in no danger  from such a hypothetical release for reasons stated previously. Also, model organisms used in our project included Escherichia  coli BL21 and DH5α.  They are non-virulent strains which are commonly used in microbiology  laboratories.
Besides, there would be no risks to security through  malicious misuse by individuals, groups or states. Any malicious misuse of  BioBrick parts or devices or microorganisms might have great threat to  security. To avoid these potential hazards, we have carefully handled our  experiments, stored our materials and products. Human error and poor technique could  compromise the best of safeguards to protect the researcher and cause unpredicted  risks to both human and environment. For this reason, we have conducted a  continuous training in safety measures for all 2012 XMU-China team members and  other laboratory workers in our laboratory.
Biosafety  Standards and Institutions
Xiamen University has its own biosafety rules that are  regulated by the Ministry of Environment Protection, P.R. China and our  institution. We carried out our experiments and evaluated bio-safety issues in  our iGEM project strictly according to the Chinese Pathogenic Microbiology  Laboratory Bio-safety Regulations, 2004, P.R. China.

Biosafety Training
Every member of our laboratory received biosafety training before  the project began. It included general laboratory safety, biosafety and  hazardous and chemical spill training. These training sessions were put on by  the code of practice and the local guidelines, and including the safety and  operations manual as well. Furthermore, every member of the iGEM team was  trained by our iGEM graduate student instructors on proper laboratory  techniques and safety procedures.
Future Safety and Security Suggestions
Since there was a Potential  Risk that if released by accident, our parts and  materials would do some negative damage to the general public. Our BioBrick parts or devices might raise the resistance of Escherichia  coli to certain antibiotics. We suppose that we could design a  mechanism into bacterium or add a device which can dissolve the released  reagents.
In addition, we believe that collecting the safety concerns and  information into a biosafety criterion book and making it become one of the  criteria would improve adherence to biosafety regulations.
