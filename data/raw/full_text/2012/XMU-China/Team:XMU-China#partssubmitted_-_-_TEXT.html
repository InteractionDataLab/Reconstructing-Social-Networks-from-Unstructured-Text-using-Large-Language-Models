Parts submitted
Here is a summary of the parts that we have submitted into the registry of standard parts. Parts BBa_K750102 to BBa_K750115 and part BBa_K750000 belong to Digital Display part of our project; Parts BBa_K750001 to BBa_K750012 belong to Time Delay part of our project. Among all these parts, we strongly recommend the BBa_K750000 and BBa_K750111, which can both be used on displaying number 0 and 1 in our immobilization device; the BBa_K750009(TD1.0), which works fastest in all our time delay devices. You can find out application of all parts in our project and data of some working parts on the data page.
