Future Plan
1. Digital  Display
Genetic parts we have constructed are more  complicated than normal BioBricks, leading to uncertain performance which may  not correspond to previous predictions. This problem highlights an issue that  how to build robust and predictable synthetic gene networks. Unlike electronic  circuits, most  newly  created  gene  circuits  are  non-functioning  due  to  intrinsic  parameter  uncertainties,  external  disturbances  and  functional  variations  of  intra-  and  extra-cellular environments [1] . In terms of molecular level, alteration in strength of the  promoter and RBS is necessitated to obtain an optimal method for assemblage of  genetic parts. Our goal for next stage is to seek a useful method for  constructing a complex genetic network that can achieve its desired steady state behaviors. Once we achieve that, a real genetic  seven-segment display will be much easier to build, so as other complex  circuits.
2. Time  Delay
Unsatisfying with our present stage of  primary research of time delay, we plan to use the marker gene GFP and then evaluate  the time spent for bio-circuits with different grade of RBSes to reach a  certain fluorescent level. Besides, we also tend to characterize the control of  pBAD and other promoter in a much more systematical way.
3. Cell  Immobilization
We have almost finished building our  display device, just a few more running tests are needed to improve and perfect  it. We plan to immobilize cells that contain other genetic circuits we  constructed and stuff them correspondingly into the seven glass tubes. The  transportation system of oxygenated medium is also needed perfection. After  some optimizing experiments, we can finally accomplish our digital display  device.   
4. E-ink
“What will we get in this project?” We have been asked for many times but still  have no idea, until an E-book displayed on our lab. We were inspired by this magical  device and got our answer.
E-book is a book-length publication in  digital form, consisting of text, images, or both, and produced on, published  through, and readable on computers or other electronic devices. [2] Its core is E-ink. E-ink is a specific proprietary type of  electronic  paper  manufactured by  E-Ink  Corporation , founded in 1997 based on research started at the  MIT Media Lab . However,  E-ink has some shortcoming, like it just can display monochromatic figure. But,  the E.coli in our project in this  year can replaced the E ink. And the microcapsules, which are used for  nurturing bacteria, can also replace the pearls, which are used for carrying ink.  We concluded all above for 4 reasons.
Digital display and E ink share  the same working principle;
There are both microcapsules on  their solution;
We can control their station by  controlling the input signal;
Comparing monochromatic E-ink,  we can construct different logical circuits in the engineering bacteria, and  add different inducer. Then the bacteria will generate chromatic GFP. In  another word, we could create multicolor E-book.
In a word, if we can improve technology, the  digital display will probably replace the traditional E-ink.
