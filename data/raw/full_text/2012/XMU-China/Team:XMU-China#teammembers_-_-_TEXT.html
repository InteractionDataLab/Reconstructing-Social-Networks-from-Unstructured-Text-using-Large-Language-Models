Our Team
Team Description:
Our core team is made of 3 instructors, 3 advisors and 15 undergraduate students across a wide range of academic backgrounds. As time goes on, we quickly learned each other's strengths and weaknesses and developed standard systems of organizational management in order to synchronize our efforts for the many parallel tasks at hand. We learned protocols, shared them with one another, worked together, and finally completed the project. Due to our different major background, which allowed us to simultaneously approach problems from many angles. We are proud of our project we have created and we hope it can leave you a deep impression.
Instructors:
