  The summer semester  begins and the biological experiment comes, so this week we mainly focus on  acquiring the basic experimental skills. As we are green-hands in the field of  synthetic biology, everyone feels very disturbed, One of our advisor Wu Xin  cheers us up and teaches us how to transform, the protocol of plasmid  extraction, how to run on a gel for restriction analysis, how to recover the  DNA and ligate two target fragment.</P><P>Monday,  April 9th
  We learn how to  isolate the plasmids and how to run on a gel for restriction analysis.  Everything is new for us!!! </P><P>Tuesday,  April 10th
  Today we complete  the inoculation of BL21, K176003, lysis, RBS<SUB>1.0</SUB></P><P>Wednesday,  April 11th　 
  The task today is  as follow:
  Inoculate K176003,  RBS <SUB>1.0</SUB>.
  Transfer P<SUB>BAD</SUB>  into competence BL21.
  Make media for two  sleeves of plates, one sleeve with Kan antibiotic added, the other with Amp.</P><P>Thursday,  April 12th
  Today we pick one  colony to a new culture medium, isolate the plasmid K176003, RBS<SUB>1.0</SUB> on the morning  and isolate the plasmid PBAD at night.</P><P>Friday, April 13th
  Saturday,  April 14th
  Everyone is busy,  so there is no experimental plan.</P><P>Sunday,  April 15th
  To make us more  skilled at the experimental manipulation, we inoculate K176003, RBS1.0 P<SUB>BAD</SUB>,  isolate the plasmid K176003, RBS<SUB>1.0</SUB>, P<SUB>BAD</SUB> again.</P><P><STRONG>Week 2: April 16th to April 22nd </STRONG>
  Monday,  April 16th
  Today we  want to make sure whether the time plasmid placed can influence the  digestion, so we chose to do a series of test. The gel electrophoresis results  shows that there is no much relation between the time plasmid placed and the  digestion.</P><P>Tuesday,  April 17th
  Today we  isolate the plasmid P<SUB>BAD</SUB>, RBS1.0 without the help of advisor Wu Xin.  the steps of plasmid extraction are too hard for us to complete them without  any mistakes. We waste many centrifuge tubes and pipet tips. However, we  finally make it.</P><P>Wednesday,  April 18th　 
  It is an  awful day!! Plasmids from the previous day are digested and run on a gel for  restriction analysis, but we got a bad result. We can only be thankful that we  acquired the protocol of agarose gel electrophoresis. Compared with plasmid  extraction, electrophoresis is easier. But we need to make the gel and grasp the  method to use microwave oven.</P><P>Thursday,  April 19th
  The task  today is to run on a gel for restriction analysis of P<SUB>BAD</SUB>, RBS<SUB>1.0</SUB>  again. The result shows that we can recover P<SUB>BAD</SUB>, RBS<SUB>1.0</SUB> and ligate  them.</P><P>Friday, April 20th
  Today we complete  inoculating BL21 and transferring P<SUB>BAD</SUB>-RBS<SUB>1.0</SUB> into competence BL21.</P><P>The next three days  we are all so busy about our study that we decide to work on next week.</P><P><STRONG>Week 3: April 23rd to April 29th</STRONG>
  Tuesday,  April 24th
  We pick  one colony and put the tubes into shaker on the morning and complete the  plasmid extraction at night.</P><P>Wednesday,  April 25th　 
  We  complete the plasmid extraction of GFP-TT, P<SUB>BAD</SUB>-RBS<SUB>1.0</SUB> and make glycerol stocks of GFP-TT, P<SUB>BAD</SUB>-RBS<SUB>1.0</SUB>.</P><P>Thursday,  April 26th
  Today we  isolate the plasmid GFP-TT, P<SUB>BAD</SUB>-RBS<SUB>1.0</SUB> and run on a gel for  restriction analysis. Then we recover the fragment P<SUB>BAD</SUB>-RBS<SUB>1.0</SUB>, GFP-TT and  ligate them.</P><P>Friday, April 27th
  Today we  complete the transformation of P<SUB>BAD</SUB>-RBS<SUB>1.0</SUB>-GFP-TT into competence  BL21.</P><P>Saturday,  April 28th
  We are  puzzled to find that the transformation fails. So we pick one colony (P<SUB>BAD</SUB>  and GFP-TT) and put the tubes into shaker again.</P><P>Sunday,  April 29th
  Today we do the  repetitive work of April 26th.</P><P><STRONG class="subtitle">May</STRONG><STRONG>Week 4: April 30 to May 6th</STRONG>
  Monday,  April 30th
  The task  today is to transfer P<SUB>BAD</SUB>-RBS<SUB>1.0</SUB>-GFP-TT into competence BL21.</P><P>Tuesday,  May 1st
  We found  that the plate were all covered with colonies on the morning, so we have a  discussion about the failure of the transformation, Wu supposes that there is  some problem with BL21 or Amp, so we inoculate new BL21 again, and we set  control group as well. At night, the result reassures us of Amp, so we  speculate BL21 is polluted and inoculate new BL21.</P><P>Wednesday,  May 2nd　  Today we isolate the plasmid PBAD,  GFP at night.</P><P>Thursday,  May 3rd
  The task  today is as follow:
  Digest  the plasmid PBAD, GFP and run on a gel for restriction analysis,  then recover the objective strap. Ligate PBAD-RBS-GFP.</P><P>Friday, May 4th
  Today we complete  the transformation of P<SUB>BAD</SUB>-RBS-GFP into competence BL21.</P><P>Saturday,  May 5th
  We find  that the plates are all covered with colonies, so we prepare the Amp solution  again.</P><P>Sunday,  May 6th
  Weekend  day for us!!</P><P><STRONG>Week 5: May 7th to May 13th</STRONG>
  Monday,  May 7th
  The  transformation of P<SUB>BAD</SUB>-RBS-GFP proves to be a failure, so we do the repetitive  work of May 3rd.</P><P>Tuesday,  May 8th
  Today we  transfer P<SUB>BAD</SUB>-RBS-GFP into competence BL21 again.</P><P>Wednesday,  May 9th　 
  Awful  day!!!!The effort we took yesterday is in vain, the plate is covered with so  many colonies which is <A href="app:ds:irregular">irregular</A>,  so we decide to choose streak plate to inoculate after a short meeting.</P><P>Thursday,  May 10th
  Today  Yao isolates and digest the plasmid PBAD-RBS-GFP and run on a gel for restriction analysis. Despite the operating error, DNA  agarose gel electrophoresis indicates that we succeed in the transformation.</P><P>Friday, May 11th
  The task today is  to pick one colony to a new culture medium and make glycerol stocks of PBAD-RBS-GFP.</P><P>Saturday,  May 12th
  Sunday,  May 13th
  Another weekday for  us! But we are not relaxed, we have to read more literature to make our project  go well.
  On the other hand,  we make the plan for next week.</P><P><STRONG>Week 6: May 14th to May 20th</STRONG>
  Monday,  May 14th
  After  our weekends, we come back to our lab, the task today is to inoculate BL21 at  night.</P><P>Tuesday,  May 15th We found some useful biobricks information the  other day, but we didn’t acquire the information of PtetR completely. So today  we only transfer PcI into the competence BL21.</P><TABLE border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><TBODY><TR><TD width="111" valign="top"><P>cI(+LVA)</P></TD><TD width="70" valign="top"><P>pSB1A2</P></TD><TD width="64" valign="top"><P>750bp</P></TD><TD width="115" valign="top"><P>2011Plate1:4E</P></TD><TD width="124" valign="top"><P><A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_C0051">Part:BBa_C0051 </A></P></TD></TR><TR><TD width="111" valign="top"><P>PcI</P></TD><TD width="70" valign="top"><P>pSB1A2</P></TD><TD width="64" valign="top"><P>49bp</P></TD><TD width="115" valign="top"><P>2011Plate1:6K</P></TD><TD width="124" valign="top"><P><A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0051">Part:BBa_R0051 </A></P></TD></TR><TR><TD width="111" valign="top"><P>PtetR</P></TD><TD width="70" valign="top"><P>pSB1A2</P></TD><TD width="64" valign="top"><P>54bp</P></TD><TD width="115" valign="top"><P>2011Plate1:6I</P></TD><TD width="124" valign="top"><P><A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0040">Part:BBa_R0040 </A></P></TD></TR><TR><TD width="111" valign="top"><P>P (LasR &amp;    PAI)</P></TD><TD width="70" valign="top"><P>pSB1A2</P></TD><TD width="64" valign="top"><P>157bp</P></TD><TD width="115" valign="top"><P>2011Plate1:12A</P></TD><TD width="124" valign="top"><P><A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0079">Part:BBa_R0079 </A></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Wednesday,  May 16th　 
  Today we  pick one colony and cultivate it. At night we are heart-struck to find that  there are no bacteria in the medium, so we inoculate again.</P><P>Thursday,  May 17th
  Today we  isolate the plasmids and digest them with the system below:
  PcI: SpeI + PstI

  Today is  really a busy day !This morning, we inoculate TT-1, TT-2, 2L-TT into BL21(Amp+  Amp-) ,pick single colony of 18A, 6I and PR-2L-TT and transform 4A-TT and 15L  into DH5α.besides, we do enzyme cut experiment to make sure the appropriate  enzyme-cut time :0.5h, 1.0h, 2h, 3h
  Tonight,  we isolate the plasmid of 18A, 4E-TT, PR-2L-TT and 6I, pick the colony of 15L.</P><P>Wednesday,  June 27th
  We  extract plasmid of 15L, Separately carried on the single enzyme and double  enzyme test to identify 15L, 4E-TT, 18A, 6I, PR-2L-TT. This afternoon, we run a  glue includes 15L, 18A, 4E-TT, PR-2L-TT and 6I</P><P>Thursday, June 28th
  Today’s  work seems easier. We inoculate RBS and 4E-TT, then pick the colony of 4A-TT. Last,  streak the TT-1</P><P>Friday, June 29th
  We extract the  plasmid of RBS, 4A-TT, TT-1, 4E-TT,identify the 4A-TT and TT-1, but the size of  TT-1 is wrong. We also link the 6I and RBS, RBS and 4A-TT, RBS and  4E-TT.Later,we preserve strains of 4A-TT and 4A-TT.</P><P>Saturday, June 30th
  Today, we transform  the RBS+[4A-TT], RBS+[4E-TT],then coating plates. Extract the plasmid of 15L  and TT-1 and identify them, but the result is not right: we cannot see the line  of TT, while the 15L has 3 bandings.</P><P>Sunday, July 1st
  We pick the colony  of RBS+ [4A-TT], RBS+[4E-TT] and 15L.later ,we extract the plasmid of TT,2L and  2L ,then identify them. The result is pleasant. This afternoon, we extract  R-AT, R-ET, 18A and 15L.</P><P><STRONG>Week 13: July 2nd to July 8th</STRONG></P><DIV>

    This  week, another three of the team members were away for internship in Zhangzhou  Campus. It meant only three members were available for the experiment.
    Colonies  were grown well in the morning. Pick one colony of each plate and cultivated.
    After 12  hours we isolated the plasmids.</P><P>Tuesday,  July 10th
    Plasmids  from the previous day were digested and ran on a gel for restriction analysis,  however the result of the gel indicated the ligation was not totally  successful: RBS-gfp(LVA)-TT should be reconstructed. So we pick another colony  from the plate.</P><P>Wednesday,  July 11th
    Prepared  the competence BL21 cells and transferred the succeed ligation product: PBAD-RBS-cI(LVA)-TT,  RBS-tetR (LVA)-TT. Isolated the plasmids of RBS-GFP (LVA)-TT and digested for  restriction analysis. After running on a gel, the plasmid turned to be right. </P><P>Thursday,  12th

    SUNNY  MONDAY!! Got up at 8:00AM and started a new week in lab. Wang realized the fact  that it would be a huge project to translate all the experimental journals into  English in last few weeks. So she started writing the new journals in English  and translating the original ones. Experiments:
    Goal: Pcons+RBS-tetR-TT,  P<SUB>BAD</SUB>+RBS-cI-TT
    At  10:00AM, no growth/colonies were observed on the plates. However, by the late  afternoon, colonies were visible on all of the plates, so picked one colony and  cultivated it.
    Plasmids  isolated and digested for ligation. BSA was added in XbaI system as description.  After 1 h of digest, we  ran on a gel. An  unanticipated band revealed the possible mistake of target gene: the band of  plasmid with BSA addition was wrong. We planed to test the BSA the next day and  do another digest for restriction analysis. To speed up, we would perform  ligation if the restriction analysis was correct. Meeting:
    Team  meeting at 7:00PM, Leader Wu divided all the members into different groups and  announced the assignments for each group: Experiment, Wiki, Human Practice, Management,  Communication. He also reiterated the experimental disciplines. Wang summarized  the experiments and pointed out our next steps: finish all the construction in  two weeks and characterize our device.</P><P>Tuesday,  17th 
    Experiments: Isolated the plasmids and digested for  analysis and ligation as well. We ran on a control test for BSA. The result of  gel indicated that problems existed both on BSA and the bacteria we preserved,  which seemed had been contaminated. </P><P>Wednesday,  18th
    Experiments
    Goal: To  verify all the bacterial glycerol stocks and the transformation.
    Experiment:
    Isolated  the plasmids, digested for restriction analysis and ran on a gel. The result  was frustrating: they were all wrong! We should perform ligation again as soon  as possible.</P><P>Thursday,  July 19th 
    Experiments:
    Goal: To  ligate PcI+Rgfp(LVA)TT, Pcons+RtetR(LVA)TT
    Isolated  the plasmid and digest for ligation. Ran on a gel and performed gel extraction.  After 4h of ligation, transferred into competence BL21 which were prepared in  July 16th. 
    Made  plates with Amp</P><P>Friday,  July 20th
    Colonies  were still invisible until late afternoon. Exciting news was that the colonies  of PcI-RBS-GFP(LVA)-TT had     fluorescence, which indicated the possible successful of transformation.  But the other one was not good: colonies could be observed only in one plate.  In the evening, picked colonies and cultivated them.   
    Saturday,  July 21st
    Experiments:
    Goal: To  verify if the transformation was successful.
    Plasmids  isolated and digested for restrict analysis. The result was upset but we still  stuck at it - after all, the bacterial liquid culture was illuminating. So  picked another two colonies in the plate and hoped for the best.</P><P>Sunday,  July 22nd
    Experiments:
    Goal: To  verify again whether the transformation was successful and prepared to  performing another ligation.
    The  bacterial liquid had fluorescence, both of them! This exciting news had raised  our hope. Isolated the plasmids and digested for restrict analysis. The result  indicated that one of the bacterial culture was correct! So added 100 μL  aliquot into LB, attempting to make bacterial glycerol stocks. However, strange  thing was that liquid culture had not illuminated! Added another 100μL  aliquot into LB and put two LB in the shaker at 37°C.</P><P><STRONG>Week 16: July 23rd to July 29th</STRONG>
    Monday,  July 23rd
    Experiments:
    Isolated  the plasmid of original correct bacterial in 21th and two liquid culture in  22nd from the original one. Ran on a gel for restriction analysis. The result  was beyond belief: only the band of   original one was correct, but it seemed that once we add 100μL  aliquot of original bacteria into new LB, the band went wrong. We cannot figure  out why this strange thing could happen. 
    In the  evening after the team meeting, streaked plate with original 7.21 liquid  culture.</P><P>Team  Meeting:
    Wang  summarized the experiments in the last week. It was a tough task building the  same two gene circuits again and again. Huang and Yu presented her  communication with 2012iGEM members in Peking University and University of  Science and Technology of China. She pointed out some shining part of them,  which we could learn from and improve our own team. Mo shared his idea on an  article he read and discussed the method for determining the fluorescent  intensity. Chi showed the progress in Human Practice: we had prepared abundant  materials and waiting for Xie's return. Fan and Yan proposed their design in  wiki and mascot, and everyone were so exciting when discussing how mascot  should be like. </P><P>Tuesday,  July 24th
    Experiments:
    Isolated  the plasmid and ran on a gel for restriction analysis. 
    Made PBS  for determining the fluorescence. </P><P>Wednesday,  July 25th
    Experiments:
    Added  1mL aliquot into 200mL new LB and put in the shaker at 37°C. After  2 hours of shaking, added 2.7mL arabinose to each liquid culture. Determined  the fluorescence value and OD600 every hour. We all learned how to use the  equipment. The values of unstable GFP were too low, which made us very nervous:  those circuits we spent so much time to made might become nonsense in a second!  We quickly isolated the plasmid for restriction analysis and ran on a gel. The  result indicated that the bacterial glycerol stocks may be contaminated, which  turned out to be the best bad news for us. </P><P>Thursday,  July 26th
    Experiments:
    Goal: To  do another ligation of constructive promoter and RBS-tetR-TT once again, to  verify the streak plate.
    Isolated  plasmids and ran on a gel. The result for ligation was perfect: the band was  neat and clear. However, that for analysis was not really good. After gel  extraction, did gel ligation and put it in 4°C, waiting  for transformation.
    Design:
    Mo, Qiu  and Yan managed to sewed a sample of our mascot. They brought needles, thread, cloth  magnet and cotton to lab. Qiu even wore a rubber glove, claiming that a  stronger friction force could be helpful in sewing, or maybe she was just used  to wear it when performing experiments. </P><P> </P><P>Friday,  July 27th 
    Experiments:
    Goal: To  verify if all the glycerol stocks of PBAD-RBS-gfp(LVA)-TT are still  correct.
    Since we  had found the high risk of mutation for liquid culture due to the transfer of  culture, another method for preserving was badly needed. Also we should verify  if the glycerol stocks are still remain the same. 
    Isolated  the plasmid for restriction analysis then ran on a gel. The result indicated  that three of four stocks had the possibility being wrong. Streaked a plate  from the right one. </P><P>Design:
    Mascot  had almost finished, only problem here was that it cannot sit or stand by  itself. Maybe thicker legs and heavier body can solve this problem.</P><P>Saturday,  July 28th
    Experiments:
    In order  to verify part PcI-RBS-gfp(LVA)-TT and ligate this part to others, did another  digest for restriction analysis and ligation. Sadly, the gel result was still  disappointing: three bands were observed after double digestion. But two of the  bands revealed that they might be correct, yet being contaminated. So Advisor  Wu decided to extract gel with correct bands and perform ligation. </P><P> </P><P>Sunday,  July 29th 
    Experiments:
    Still  stuck at PcI!!! Isolated plasmid from the streaking plate from original  transformation one. Digested for restriction analysis and ran on a gel. The  result was still not pleasant. Taking advice from another graduate student  Zheng, diluted the liquid culture in 10-6 and 10-7 times  and spread on LB Agar with Amp. </P><P><STRONG class="subtitle">August</STRONG><STRONG>Week 17: July 30th to August 5th</STRONG>

    In the  morning, we started on the first try. After plasmid isolation and digestion,  ran on a gel and result was still sad. So we try again in the late afternoon  and performed ligation. 
    The  colonies in the plate of the previous day grew well, so picked one colony of  each plate and streaked lines at the same time. </P><P>Team  Meeting:
    Wang  summarized the genetic circuit parts finished last week, and restated the  essentials of attitude and carefulness when conducting experiments.

    Experiments:
    Goal: To  ligate RBS-tetR-TT with PcI-RBS-gfp(LVA)-TT
    Isolated  plasmids and digested for ligation. After running a gel,  bands appeared not having been digested  completely. Still did the ligation anyway.</P><P>Cell  Immobilization:
    We  started thinking about methods to establish our numeric display device and to  bring our engineering bacteria into operation. Obviously, the foremost thing we  should do is to fix the engineering bacteria from freely suspended cultivation  to the tubes of our device, namely cell immobilization. Meanwhile, cultivation  condition and fluorescence intensity of immobilized cells should be made  certain.
    After  studying literatures and asking senior students for help, we decided to explore  three kinds of methods of immobilizing our engineering bacteria: 1) calcium  alginate beads; 2) PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules, 3)  intra-hollow  Ca-alginate capsules.</P><P> </P><P>Thursday,  August 2nd

    Goal: To  prepare calcium alginate and embed engineering bacteria with plasmid PBAD-RGT.
    Prepared:  3% sodium alginate solution; 0.05 mol/L CaCl2 solution; sterile water.
    Centrifuged  the cultivated sample for 1min at 6000rpm to collect the deposit (about 2~3g).  Resuspend the cells with sterile water and centrifuge for 1min at 6000rpm，and drained off the  supernatant. Mixed the cells with sterile water in a mass ratio of 1:2, then  added equivalent volume of sodium alginate solution, mixing thoroughly.
    Drew  the  mixture in a 10mL injector, then  dropped it one by one through the pinhead into 100mL  CaCl2 solution,  stirring at the same time. Laid it aside for  2 hours. Then drained off  the CaCl2  solution and rinsed the calcium alginate beads with sterile water for 2 or 3  times. Added 100mL  CaCl2 solution,  soaking the beads overnight.</P><P> </P><P>Saturday,  August 4th

    Prepared:  sulfuric acid and ethanol solution(1.51:1) maintained at 0℃; dry absorbent co/p&gt;
tton maintained at 60℃; industrial alcohol; deionized water; NaOH  solution.
    Immersed  4g  dry absorbent cotton in the solution  in ice-bath for 66 min. Then squeezed out the solution and rinsed the reacted  linters with alcohol in draught cupboard. Put it in 400mL deionized water and  regulated pH to about 3. Stirred and dissolved it for 10 min then filtrated it.  Collected the filtrate and regulated pH to 9.3 accurately. Added industrial  alcohol, 1~1.5 times of the filtrate, until there appeared white retiary  floccule. Centrifuged the floccule for 5 min at 5,000rpm and collected it. 65°C drying  for more than 24 h.</P><P>Time  delay:

The image showed that transformation was almost successful,  still two of them appeared to be contaminated. We hope those extra bands were  due to some careless mistakes during isolation process, not transformation. </P><P>Cell  Immobilization:

    Goal: To  prepare PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules.
    Got 2.17  g NaCS. 
    Before  making the microcapsules, we prepared 6% PDMDAAC solution and NaCS solution  (the concentration was not sure ). For ensuring the concentration of NaCS  solution we need, firstly we dissolved 0.4 g in 20mL deionized water,82°C water  bath, and gradually added NaCS to make it more dense and more viscous.

    Today  was a TERRIBLE day for experiments. After restriction analysis, all bands  seemed to be correct, which cheered up everyone. However, another gel for  ligation was abysmal. Six bands were observed after double digestion! Maybe  enzyme was contaminated or added wrongly. Only thing we could do was to start  all over again.</P><P>Cell  Immobilization:
    Got  approximate 5% NaCS solution. Put the 6% PDMDAAC solution on a magnetic stirrer  and stirred it at a certain speed, maintaining a small eddy in the center of  liquid surface. Then dropped the NaCS solution into the fringe of the eddy by a  1mL injector. The drop then formed a spheroidic membrane. And if the rotating  speed was too high, that spheroidicity will be torn and destroyed. The denser  the NaCS solution is, the harder the microcapsules are destroyed. 
    After testing,  we decided to dissolve more NaCS, until approximate 7%.</P><P>Time  delay:

    Today  was quite BUSY! The number of tubes prepared for plasmid isolation raised up to  24! We had to divided them into two groups and perform isolation separately.  Gel for restriction analysis was a disaster! Only one sample seemed to be right,  whereas others were terribly wrong. Maybe the workload was too heavy to prevent  any mistake, or maybe the bacteria were so naughty not cooperating with us. Wu  advised us to decrease workload and perform ligation in a higher quality  standard. In the evening, Hu wanted to do another restriction analysis using  the same bacteria as morning's. We REALLY want to know why gel looked like  that. Fortunately, the bands were closer to Mr. Right, though several wrong  bands could be observed. Wang decided to give up glycerol stocks and reduce the  workload, hoping to make all things correct. </P><P>Cell  Immobilization:
    After  getting the NaCS solution in a proper concentration, we started to make the  microcapsules entrapping engineering bacteria with plasmid PcI-RLT.
    Centrifuged  10mL sample and collected the deposit. Added 10mL NaCS solution and mixed it thoroughly  with the cells. Put the 6% PDMDAAC solution on a magnetic stirrer and stirred  it at a certain speed, maintaining a small eddy in the center of liquid  surface. Then dropped the mixture into the fringe of the eddy by a 1mL injector  until it formed a spheroidic membrane. It took 10 min to react and completely  form microcapsules. After that, we tipped all microcapsules to a strainer and  rinsed it with sterile water. Then transferred all microcapsules  into   LB medium with Ampicillin, 37°C shaker incubated  at 100rpm. 
    The  new-made microcapsules were filled and translucent. But after 4 hours the  culture solution appeared turbid, showing that there were some microcapsules broke  and bacteria leaked into the medium.</P><P>Time  delay:

In the afternoon, almost every  member went to a presentation delivered by Professors from Taiwan. Before we  left, Wu set up a program which supposed to automatically shut down the  electrophoresis apparatus after 30 minutes.   However, it did not work!! Gel kept running for 48 minutes until Ma  figured out something wrong. We came back, nervous and regretful. Anyway, brought  gel to take a photo. Fortunately, it seemed that Ma's timely pause prevented a  disaster: the bands were just around the border. PBAD was correct,  another gel was extracted for ligation. With great regret, Wu decided to  isolate plasmids personally and ran another gel to get better a electrophoresis  photo.</P><P>Cell  Immobilization:

    Today  went smoothly, except for the plates of the previous day. We cannot figure out  why no colonies could be observed in some plates, while others grew well.  Competence cells were made in the same time. Wang looked up all the possible  reasons and was perturbed about the competence cells she made and  transformation procedure. To find where the problem is, she did a positive  control using the remained competence cells.   If the positive control does not produce the expected result, there may  be something wrong with the experimental procedure, and the experiment is  repeated. </P><P>Cell  Immobilization:

    Another  sad day for the lab. No colonies can be observed in the transformation plate  except for positive control. If the problem was not competence BL21 or  transformation process, ligation is to blame for the failure. For another part,  isolated plasmid and digest for restriction analysis. The electrophoresis photo  indicated the failure of ligation. Since the part get longer, there is a great  chance of unsuccessful ligation.
    Wang  found water has leaked into some plates preserved close to the wall of the 4°C  refrigerator. It seemed that parafilm was not so airtight and waterproof as we  thought. She took out them and streaked the plate once again.</P><P>Time-delay:

    Shuqin  introduced their work on cell immobilization last week. Two method, calcium  alginate and NACS PDNDAAC microcapsule, were performed at the same time. They  will finish CAD drawing of equipment next week. Yunxin presented the journal  her wrote about their group. She also referred paper research on unstable GFP.  Wu thought more research were needed, especially on those iGEM teams who had  experience on unstable GFP. It takes about one week to prepare the NACS. Wu  pointed out that we should succeed in cell immobilization first, then to  consider improvement methods. Some preparation tests will help the next stage  works. 
    Muxin  showed her works on team description. Some members still haven’t handed in  their personal description. Moson delivered his presentation in English.

    After  discussion with Mrs. Wu, we thought that it is inappropriate to use BL21 during  the whole construction process. Strains should first be in DH5α and assemble  together. </P><P>Cell  Immobilization:
    Experiment:
    Transferred  the PBAD-RLT and PcI-RLT capsules into 20mL LB medium  separately and cultivated them for 12 hours. Put 200uL 500mM Arabinose solution  into the PBAD-RLT culture medium  at the second hour. 
    Results:  Both  capsules embedding the bacteria with PBAD-RLT  and with PcI-RLT  were not fluorescent, and the culture medium were turbid, telling that some  bacteria had leaked from the capsules.</P><P>Prepared intra-hollow  Ca-alginate capsules with E.coli with plasmid PBAD-RLT .
    Results:  The capsules were trailing, not as spherical as we supposed them to be. After  observation and analysis, we considered that the 1.2% w/v CMC solution and 2%  w/v CaCl<SUB>2</SUB> solution mixture had changed its structure after autoclaving,  and the viscosity and density of the cationic mixture had decreased. So  the way of sterilization should be modified.</P><P>Fluorescence  Test:
    We chose  certain levels of Arabinose concentration after analyzing the data we had  gotten from experiments before to set a new gradient. In this time, we used a  stronger colony from a new plate with revived strain. As we expected,  fluorescence intensity of all samples kept at higher levels than ones of  experiment on Wednesday. Both top value and the time when it appears of every  sample with specific arabinose concentration are almost parallel with previous  ones. Besides, we also used a new type of clear plate with a cap to take  kinetic fluorescence measurements with the same gradient of arabinose  concentration after we finished interval test.   But curves showed us an unsatisfying result – top values were totally  low and tendencies of fluorescence intensity were not obvious. We thought the  cap of the plate made the strain grew in an oxygen-limited environment so that  green fluorescence proteins could not be oxided So far, tests about fluorescence  intensity of the strain with a plasmid called PBADRLT have nearly  been finished.</P><P>Design:

    To  verified whether cell(a,d) is successfully constructed, we picked one colony  from transformation plate and isolate plasmids. After digestion and  electrophoresis, we found the ligation was failed, so ligation was performed  again. </P><P>Cell  Immobilization:
    Experiment:
    Prepared  intra-hollow  Ca-alginate capsules with distilled water inside.
    Tried to  make capsules out of super clean bench. Prepared the cationic solution and the  sodium alginate solution without sterilization, but kept the solution at the  same ratio. Cell suspension was replaced by equal distilled water. Other steps  remain as usual.
    Results:  The capsules we made were in perfect round shape, when using the solutions  without autoclaving. Comparing the recent two batches of capsules, new methods  of preparing and sterilization of solutions should be applied.</P><P>Fluorescence  Test:
    As a new  circuit finished by the group of Time Delay, tests about it were taken today.  We referred to the data we have gotten before for these tests, since this  circuit also includes the PBAD – a promoter which we had also used  as a brick to structure the PBADRLT. We made a mistake that we used the DH5α,  which is good at gene constructions but not protein expressions, instead of  BL21 so that protein expressions of this strain got low levels. </P><P>Design:

    Experiment:
    Prepared  intra-hollow  Ca-alginate capsules with E.coli with plasmid PBAD-RLT .
    Placed  10mL 4% w/v CaCl<SUB>2</SUB> solution and 2.4g CMC powder into two different  200mL beakers. Prepared 100mL 1% w/v sodium alginate solution .
    Sterilized  the two beakers (contained CaCl2 solution and CMC powder  respectively) and the alginate solution in an autoclave at 120kPa and 121℃for 20 min.
    After  autoclaving, dissolved the CMC powder with 10mL distilled water and mixed  with 10mL 4% w/v CaCl2 solution.
    Mixed  1.5mL 4% w/v CaCl2 solution and 1.5mL CMC solution with 0.6mL cell suspension,  then dropped the mixture into vortical sodium alginate solution. 
    Results:  The droplets also couldn't be a normal sphere. However, when the mixture of the  same ratio was dropped into 1% w/v alginate solution without autoclaving, the  droplets could form round and transparent capsules.  Even the same  cationic solution with autoclaving still could produce normal  spherical capsules. Therefore, we judged that autoclaving had a  significant impact on sodium alginate solution. The alginate solution through  autoclaving became pale yellow and its viscosity decreased.</P><P>Wednesday,  September 5th</P><P>Digit  Display:
    Big day  for experiment, not a good big however. When discussing our circuits with  Xuesong, we found there might be some problem in construction work. Therefore,  we asked Mrs. Wu's advices. She suggested to use DH5α  rather than BL21 as competence cells and to perform ligation again from parts.  BL21 is not a safe choose for storing plasmids, which is a fact that we were  too late to realize. That means we are going to have a tough time, much tougher  than before. </P><P>Cell  Immobilization:
    Experiment:
    Prepared  intra-hollow Ca-alginate capsules with plasmid PcI-RLT.
    Result:  The capsules were spherical and droplets rarely stuck together. But they didn't  emit fluorescence as well as they were supposed to. Maybe the bacteria sample  didn't carry a steady PcI-RLT and some of the plasmid had lost during the  transfer process. Or we didn't effectively embed the bacteria into the  capsules.</P><P>Fluorescence  Test:

In general, data gave no distinct connection  between arabinose concentration and values of fluorescence intensity.
