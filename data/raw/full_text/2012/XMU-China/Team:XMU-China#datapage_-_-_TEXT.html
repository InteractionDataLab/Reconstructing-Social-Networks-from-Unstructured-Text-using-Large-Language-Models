Data Page
1. The Design
Figure 1: Digital display could output number or letter when input  a specific  signal. It also can accept different  signals to output more information.
Figure 2:After the inducing by arabinose, the  duration of response time for GFP expression increases as the strength of RBS  declines, bringing about a time-course display.
2. Data From New Parts Submitted To The Registry
Parts of Single-Input BCD Decoder System
BBa_K750000, BBa_K750103, BBa_K750111 - these parts contain PBAD (BBa_K206000), PcI (BBa_R0051) and Ptet (BBa_J102002) respectively and all contain gfp-lva (BBa_K145015). We have characterized the expression of these parts in Digital Display section of our project in the wiki.
Parts of Dual-Input BCD Decoder System
BBa_K750102, BBa_K750104, BBa_K750105, BBa_K750106, BBa_K750107 - these parts all contain cI (BBa_C0051) and are used to regulate parts controlled by PcI (BBa_R0051). We also have characterized the expression of these parts by protein electrophoresis in Digital Display section of our project in the wiki.
BBa_K750108, BBa_K750109, BBa_K750110, BBa_K750112, BBa_K750113, BBa_K750114, BBa_K750115 – these composite parts are made up of BBa_K750000, BBa_K750102, BBa_K750103, BBa_K750104 and BBa_K750111. Most of them have been characterized in Digital Display section of our project in the wiki.
Parts of Time Delay System
BBa_K750001, BBa_K750002, BBa_K750003, BBa_K750004, BBa_K750005 - these parts contain RBS1.0 (BBa_B0034), RBS0.6 (BBa_B0030), RBS0.3 (BBa_B0032), RBS0.07 (BBa_B0031) and RBS0.01 (BBa_B0033) respectively and they both contain luxI (BBa_C0061). These parts, induced by arabinose, are used to regulate the expression of AHL.
BBa_K750006 – this part contains luxR (BBa_C0062) and is induced by arabinose.
BBa_K750009, BBa_K750010, BBa_K750011, BBa_K750012 – these composite parts are characterized in Time Delay section of our project in the wiki.
3. Data From Characterized Parts Already In The Registry
BBa_K145015 – characterized the gene gfp-lva by protein electrophoresis. Please see our Digital Display section for more information.
