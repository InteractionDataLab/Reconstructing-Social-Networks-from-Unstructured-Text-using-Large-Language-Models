						databases from various sources. Basically we used information
						about the complete genome provided by NCBI. NCBI is useful because
						it not only provides information on the genome sequence, but also
						COG information on the function of the genome. We think that it is
						important to obtain a result that is not much different from that
						obtained with the experiment, so we also used the data of
						essential genes that DEG analyzed. In addition, to overcome the
						limitation of the classification of function that COG has, we also
						used the Gene Ontology information to show the information about
						the products of the gene. Because most of the selected data are
						related to PATRIC, we used PATRI data as a base.</P><H2>1-2. Composition of DB</H2><P>We established a database in two major sites. The two sites
						are NMPDR(http://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Home) and
						DEG(http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg/). Especially, in NMPDR it
						connects the database of NCBI and GO(http://www.geneontology.org/)
						with user's. In effect, it is constructed with 4 different
						databases. In the database of NMPDR or NCBI, the information on
						genome and gene sequence is provided. At DEG, the information on
						essential genes is disclosed with experiments. Lastly, the
						information on the function of genes is provided by GO.</P><H2>1-3. Selection of the Subject of Analysis and the Reasons</H2><P><STRONG>1) Selection of the Subject of Analysis and the
							Reason</STRONG></P><P>It is known that though we use a computer, it takes long
						time to find the gene that every species have in common. Also, we
						have found out that to establish our own experimental methods and
						analysis standard to gain the same result as the results from
						experiments, we need a specific species. So we selected the
						subject to be analyzed.</P><P><STRONG>2) The Subject of Analysis </STRONG></P><P>The subject to be analyze has to be the one whose accuracy
						of analysis pursued by can be checked. So there should be more
						than two species in the same genus whose essential genes have been
						revealed in vitro. Of the data provided by DEG which analyze
						essential genes with experiments, the genus that meet this
						requirement are Escherichia, Mycoplasma, Salmonella,
						Staphylococcus, Streptococcus. And we chose Streptococcus,
						considering the number of the specimen and the analysis time.</P><H2>1-4. Selecting Methods of Analysis and Basis</H2><P><STRONG>1) The Method of Analysis</STRONG></P><P>We conduct analysis to find essential genes following the
						sequence in the next flow chart.</P><P><STRONG>2) The First Analysis(Determination of BLAST
							standard) and Reliability </STRONG></P><P>As we emphasized earlier, we hope that there is no
						difference between the results we get and that in vitro results.
						So we are going to prove it in our first analysis. In our first
						analysis, we used Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 and Streptococcus
						sanguinis SK36, as they are in the same Streptococcus genuses and
						essential genes are found with in vitro experimental methods. We
						verified reliability of the result and the accuracy of the
						analysis method by blasting the two data with our BLAST standards.
					</P><P><STRONG>3) BLAST Analysis Results</STRONG></P><P>We label the essential gene information produced by DEG as a
						(+), and the gene that is not produced as a (-). Also we label the
						genes that are thought to be essential genes according to our
						analysis as a (+), and the ones that don't a (-), and made a 2x2
						cross diagram. In this, we are aware that though we analyze the
						same data by BLAST, the result can be different depending on the
						query. So we switch the two data on the diagram and analyze it
						repeatedly.</P><P>CASE 1) DB : Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 / Query :
						Streptococcus sanguinis SK36</P><P>CASE 2) DB : Streptococcus sanguinis SK36 / Qurey :
						Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4</P><P><STRONG>4) Verification of the credibility of BLAST
							Analysis</STRONG></P><P><I>4-1) Verification of the BLAST Analysis Standard</I></P><P>To verify reliability of the standards in BLAST, we use
						Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy. 'Sensitivity' is the
						probability that essential genes of DEG are analyzed as essential
						gene also in our analysis result. 'Specificity' is the probability
						that non-essential genes of DEG are actually analyzed as the same
						in our result. And 'Accuracy' is the probability that shows the
						degree of correspondence between the results in the whole
						specimen.</P><P>If the Accuracy value is over 80%, it means that the results
						made by BLAST Analysis Standard is reliable. Therefore, the
						results that we infer are reliable as well.</P><P>Then we conduct Likelihood test to check the validity of the
						Accuracy to show that Accuracy can analyze accurate reliability.</P><P><I>4-2) Verification of the reliability of BLAST Analysis
							Results</I></P><P>To procure the reliability of analysis result, we conduct
						the McNemar test.By this, we can be sure that the analysis result
						with experiments is not much different from that with our
						analysis.</P><P><I> 4-3) The Second Analysis (Annotation)</I></P><P>We applied the BLAST standards confirmed by the first analysis. We used it and grouped the genes with the similar sequence using the BLAST result and annotate with our own ID. That is, the genes annotated with the same ID are regarded as the same genes. At this time, we call the ID that we give in our own way a 'Synb UID'. It is give you information of COG number that shows gene species, SynB number, the way of EG, SG, and None, and functions.</P><P>4-3. 1)Essential gene : If all the 82 total genome have a same Synb UID, then we infer them as an 'Essential Gene'. </P><P>From a result of the second analysis, the total essential genes in 82 species of Streptococcus are about 478.</P><P>4-3. 2) Specific gene : If all the 82 total genome were not found the same Synb UID anybody genome, we named it a 'Specific Gene'. </P><P>It is expecting to us that characteristic information of relevant group shows it.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
