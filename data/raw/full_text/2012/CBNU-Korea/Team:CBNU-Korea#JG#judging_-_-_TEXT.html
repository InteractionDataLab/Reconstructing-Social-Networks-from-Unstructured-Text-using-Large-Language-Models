Present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Regional Jamboree.
Develop and make available via The Registry of Software Tools an       open source software tool that supports synthetic biology based on       BioBrick standard biological parts.
Remember, the iGEM       judges will be looking for substantial team-based software       projects.

AND Either develop a new standard or use SBOL
Develop and document a new technical standard that supports the:
1) design of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
2)       construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
3)       characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices, or
4)       analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices,       or
5) sharing BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via       physical DNA, or as information via the Internet
In place of developing a new standard, a team may instead       use SBOL in its software documentation.
