BUGS - Brick & Unique minimal Genome Software
We have developed two distinct software tools.
The first tool is Brick Designer. With this, users can design new       bio-bricks. It is also able to synthesize bio-bricks by using the       bricks whitch are registered in partsregistry. Users can also       utilize bricks he just designed. We tried to enhance software       potability by enabling the designed bricks to save as Genbank and       SBOL format. Brick also can be saved as picture file so that it is       helpful in the Wiki implementation.
Second       tool, Minimal Genome Designer is functionally divided into two       program, Designer and Viewer. The Viewer shows a lot of       information of genomes and genes. For example, Location of       essential genes and the function of genes. It also provides       information of genomes in both linear and circular form. Using       this, it will be easier for users to understand the characteristic       of genomes. By the designer, user can design minimal genomes by       essential genes which are predicted by our team in this year. It       shows the information of essential genes that can exist in eash       section like frequency of location on 82 species, function and       etc. When it is done to design minimal genome, it can be viewed on       Viewer.
