1. Method
1-1. Selection of DB and Reasons
To provide various information on genome, we combined the       databases from various sources. Basically we used information       about the complete genome provided by NCBI. NCBI is useful because       it not only provides information on the genome sequence, but also       COG information on the function of the genome. We think that it is       important to obtain a result that is not much different from that       obtained with the experiment, so we also used the data of       essential genes that DEG analyzed. In addition, to overcome the       limitation of the classification of function that COG has, we also       used the Gene Ontology information to show the information about       the products of the gene. Because most of the selected data are       related to PATRIC, we used PATRI data as a base.
1-2. Composition of DB
We established a database in two major sites. The two sites       are NMPDR(http://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Home) and       DEG(http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg/). Especially, in NMPDR it       connects the database of NCBI and GO(http://www.geneontology.org/)       with user's. In effect, it is constructed with 4 different       databases. In the database of NMPDR or NCBI, the information on       genome and gene sequence is provided. At DEG, the information on       essential genes is disclosed with experiments. Lastly, the       information on the function of genes is provided by GO.
1-3. Selection of the Subject of Analysis and the Reasons
1) Selection of the Subject of Analysis and the        Reason
It is known that though we use a computer, it takes long       time to find the gene that every species have in common. Also, we       have found out that to establish our own experimental methods and       analysis standard to gain the same result as the results from       experiments, we need a specific species. So we selected the       subject to be analyzed.
2) The Subject of Analysis
The subject to be analyze has to be the one whose accuracy       of analysis pursued by can be checked. So there should be more       than two species in the same genus whose essential genes have been       revealed in vitro. Of the data provided by DEG which analyze       essential genes with experiments, the genus that meet this       requirement are Escherichia, Mycoplasma, Salmonella,       Staphylococcus, Streptococcus. And we chose Streptococcus,       considering the number of the specimen and the analysis time.
1-4. Selecting Methods of Analysis and Basis
1) The Method of Analysis
We conduct analysis to find essential genes following the       sequence in the next flow chart.
2) The First Analysis(Determination of BLAST        standard) and Reliability
As we emphasized earlier, we hope that there is no       difference between the results we get and that in vitro results.       So we are going to prove it in our first analysis. In our first       analysis, we used Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 and Streptococcus       sanguinis SK36, as they are in the same Streptococcus genuses and       essential genes are found with in vitro experimental methods. We       verified reliability of the result and the accuracy of the       analysis method by blasting the two data with our BLAST standards.
3) BLAST Analysis Results
We label the essential gene information produced by DEG as a       (+), and the gene that is not produced as a (-). Also we label the       genes that are thought to be essential genes according to our       analysis as a (+), and the ones that don't a (-), and made a 2x2       cross diagram. In this, we are aware that though we analyze the       same data by BLAST, the result can be different depending on the       query. So we switch the two data on the diagram and analyze it       repeatedly.
CASE 1) DB : Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 / Query :       Streptococcus sanguinis SK36
CASE 2) DB : Streptococcus sanguinis SK36 / Qurey :       Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4
4) Verification of the credibility of BLAST        Analysis
4-1) Verification of the BLAST Analysis Standard
To verify reliability of the standards in BLAST, we use       Sensitivity, Specificity, and Accuracy. 'Sensitivity' is the       probability that essential genes of DEG are analyzed as essential       gene also in our analysis result. 'Specificity' is the probability       that non-essential genes of DEG are actually analyzed as the same       in our result. And 'Accuracy' is the probability that shows the       degree of correspondence between the results in the whole       specimen.
If the Accuracy value is over 80%, it means that the results       made by BLAST Analysis Standard is reliable. Therefore, the       results that we infer are reliable as well.
Then we conduct Likelihood test to check the validity of the       Accuracy to show that Accuracy can analyze accurate reliability.
4-2) Verification of the reliability of BLAST Analysis        Results
To procure the reliability of analysis result, we conduct       the McNemar test.By this, we can be sure that the analysis result       with experiments is not much different from that with our       analysis.
4-3) The Second Analysis (Annotation)
We applied the BLAST standards confirmed by the first analysis. We used it and grouped the genes with the similar sequence using the BLAST result and annotate with our own ID. That is, the genes annotated with the same ID are regarded as the same genes. At this time, we call the ID that we give in our own way a 'Synb UID'. It is give you information of COG number that shows gene species, SynB number, the way of EG, SG, and None, and functions.
4-3. 1)Essential gene : If all the 82 total genome have a same Synb UID, then we infer them as an 'Essential Gene'.
From a result of the second analysis, the total essential genes in 82 species of Streptococcus are about 478.
4-3. 2) Specific gene : If all the 82 total genome were not found the same Synb UID anybody genome, we named it a 'Specific Gene'.
It is expecting to us that characteristic information of relevant group shows it.
