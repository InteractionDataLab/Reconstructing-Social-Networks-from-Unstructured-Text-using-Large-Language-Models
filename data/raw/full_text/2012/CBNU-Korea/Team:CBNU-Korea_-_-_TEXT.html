Brick & Unique minimal Genome Software
We have developed two distinct software tools.
The first tool is Brick Designer. With this, users can design new      bio-bricks. It is also able to synthesize bio-bricks by using the      bricks whitch are registered in partsregistry. Users can also      utilize bricks he just designed. We tried to enhance software      potability by enabling the designed bricks to save as Genbank and      SBOL format. Brick also can be saved as picture file so that it is      helpful in the Wiki implementation.
Second tool,      Minimal Genome Designer is functionally divided into two program,      Designer and Viewer. The Viewer shows a lot of information of      genomes and genes. For example, Location of essential genes and the      function of genes. It also provides information of genomes in both      linear and circular form. Using this, it will be easier for users      to understand the characteristic of genomes. By the designer, user      can design minimal genomes by essential genes which are predicted      by our team in this year. It shows the information of essential      genes that can exist in eash section like frequency of location on      82 species, function and etc. When it is done to design minimal      genome, it can be viewed on Viewer.
