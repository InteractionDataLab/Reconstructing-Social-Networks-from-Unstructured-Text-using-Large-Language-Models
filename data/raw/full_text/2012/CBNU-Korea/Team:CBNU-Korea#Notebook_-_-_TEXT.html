March. 26th – April. 1th
Tuesday
■CBNU-KOREA team is organized
■Had first meeting
■Introduced about iGem & previous project of CBNU-KOREA
Thursday
■Planned plan of near future
■(Start -> Find similar gene       comparing sequence by BLAST in 15 species(DEG) -> Certify between       ssential genes and result of BLAST -> Certify if it is equal or       over than 80% -> If it is, adjust to 1500 species.)
■Department of Computer engineering : Planned to study for the       possibilities of the automation of BLAST.
■Department of       Statistics: Planned to calculate probability to be match between       BLAST results and experimently presumed essential genes.
■Department of Microbiology: Planned to study for the database of       NCBI(Variable of NC file).
Friday
■Re-defined the name of the project of this year(BIDOB)
■Planned to presume essential brick using NCBI data.
Apr. 2nd – Apr. 8th
Tuesday
■Parsed a data of 15 species in NCBI and built DB for a first       time.
■Made a result of analysis and built it to DB.
■Planned to study to have a understandable reliability(%) on our       analysis.
Thursday
Build DB of NCBI information.
Friday
■Presumption of Essential Gene : Grouped more than two species and       analyzed characteristic of each genome. Studied a EGGS Site.
■Analysis of location, direction and array of essential gene :       Studied for organization analysis of statistic-biology. Studied       some of research paper.
■Implementing viewer : Planned to       study for JAVA computer language.
Saturday
■Presumption of Essential Gene : Find species-EG by analyzing in       each species.
■Presumption of Essential Gene : Find       Essential gene by analyzing result between species.
■Presumption of Essential Function : Analyze function of each       essential genes.
■Analyzing the array of genes : Analyze       location and array of essential genes and every genes.
■Implement Viewer by built DB.
