						the genetic information of many species. Also as the scientific
						technique developed, we can insert and compose the genome. If we
						can design a whole genome, then we will be able to make a one and
						only useful genome. But as today, the compose of the minimum
						genome made with the essential gene has succeeded, but did not
						last.</P><H2>1-2. Object</H2><P>To design a genome, we have to analyze the pattern of the
						genome and the distribution of the gene.</P><H2>1-3. Method and the range of the study</H2><P>
						The study was used information of species in streptococcus by
						patric database (<A href="http://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Home">
							http://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Home</A>) and SynbUID.				The Data was built by mysql 5.5.27, and a statistical analysis
						program was used by SAS 9.3.
					</P><H1>2. Design</H1><H2>2-1. Prepare</H2><P><STRONG>1) Build database</STRONG></P><P>
						An attribute of Genome name is consisted of ID, Genome_name, COG,
						Start, End, Strand, and Size. An attribute of Annotation
						Table_EG is consisted of ID, locus, and SynbUID. Two entities are
						paired of Locus_tag 1 by 1.
					</P><P><STRONG>2) Represented sample number</STRONG></P><P>For checking the number of specimen that is representative,
						we used a simple random sampling method, and assumed that the
						complete genome is random. We used the significance level (a=0.05)
						and the limit of error (b=0.1). The total species of streptococcus
						is 494 species, and between these, 82 species are completed.
						According to our calculation, when there is 81 species, the result
						is satisfied. Therefore, as a result, 82 complete species
						represent the streptococcus.</P><P><STRONG>3) Standard</STRONG></P><P>3-1) Divided the interval of the genome</P><P>The number and size of the genome differs between species.
						To supplement this problem, we divided the genes in a section to
						show the genome’s size as a proportion. As a result, when we
						divided the analyzing section less then a hundred, it was hard to
						see the patterns because the data has been diluted. And when we
						divided it into more then a hundred pieces, it was not that
						different from the result that divided it into a hundred pieces.
						So we decided to divide it into a hundred pieces.</P><P>3-2) Identified the starting point</P><P>The number one ORF of each gene sequence analysis data is
						different between every species. Thus we had to make a specific
						standard to equalize the beginning of the data. We checked the
						strand pattern of each genome and identified it with the strands.
					</P><H2>2-2. Analysis</H2><P><STRONG>1) Strand</STRONG></P><P>- We chose 77 species out of 82 species randomly, and
						estimated the patterns of the strand ratio of each sections, and
						verified the estimated number with the other 5 species.</P><P>- We checked the strand ratio of the essential gene.</P><P><STRONG>2) Region</STRONG></P><P>- We found the COG and the frequency of the essential gene
						because of referred to the genome design</P><P>
						2-1) We checked where the essential genome is distributed.2-2)
						We checked where the gene by being provided COG is distributed.
					</P><H1>3. Result</H1><H2>2-1. Strand</H2><P>When we checked the strand pattern of the 82 species, the
						genes were distributed in 4 places with different tendency. So we
						decided the section of the proc transreg as 4, and analyzed.</P><P><STRONG>1) Estimated the transpose linear regression</STRONG></P><P>We explained with a theory that ‘The null hypothesis does
						not satisfy the regression model, but the alternative hypothesis
						does.’ As a result in the SAS, according to the null hypothesis,
						the F-value was 3093.13, and the P=value &lt;.0001. Therefore at a
						significance level of 0.01, the null hypothesis is dismissible. In
						other words, the regression model is more suitable.</P><P><STRONG>2) Estimated factor β0, β1</STRONG></P><P>As the notable probability gets smaller, it can affect the
						dependent variable more. According to the null hypothesis, the
						F-value of β0 is 10.13, and the Pr &gt; F 0.0015. So the null
						hypothesis is dismissable. And the estimated calculation is
						1.22744031. Also F-value of β1 was 3093.13, and the Pr &gt; F
						&lt;.0001, so again the null hypothesis is dismissed. Therefore, the
						estimated number is 0.97546498.</P><P><STRONG>3) Estimated the transe regression model</STRONG></P><P>
						As a result to look the distribution of the strand to each
						species, we found a similar pattern. Thus we studied the pattern
						of the strand distribution after to range a standard by section
						which is changed the strand's sign. By using The Transpose
						Regression Method, we have a result to be able to express The
						Spline Regression Model by the distribution pattern of the strand
						of 82 species. Identity(spercent) = 1.22744031
						+ 0.97546498*spline(interval)

					</P><P>The X axis shows the 100 sections of the genome of the
						randomly selected 77 species. And the Y axis is the ratio of the +
						patterns of each section. The sum of each section’s +, - pattern
						is 100. According to the graph above, when the standard number is
						50, the + patterns appears as 25 on the left, and the – pattern on
						the right higher than 80. So in this case, it is a + pattern.</P><P><STRONG>4) Verifying the estimated Prediction Equation is
							adequate.</STRONG></P><P>By conducting the chi-square test with the estimated
						transpose linear regression prediction equation with the 77
						randomly selected species, we verified if the equation is
						adequate. The null hypothesis is independent from the prediction
						equation and the other 5 species that was not selected. And the
						alternative hypothesis is subordinate with the prediction equation
						and the 5 species. The p-value of the 5 species is independent
						from the prediction equation estimated by the null hypothesis. We
						can see that it is subordinate when it is dismissed.</P><H2>2-2. Region</H2><P>We estimated the origin which is a part of changed strand’s
						pattern.</P><P><STRONG>1) The spread of the essential genes is shown at
							the table below.</STRONG></P><P>The X axis shows the 20 sections of the genome size. And the
						Y axis is the frequency of the genome. As a result to guess the
						distribution of the essential gene, the graph is showed like that.
						We know that 322 essential genes among 485 essential gene are
						distributed a bilateral symmetry in the middle of origin. We can
						divide between the Synb_ID which is the origin of high frequency
						and Synb_ID which is the origin of high frequency by both sides.</P><P><STRONG>2) The spread of the genes provided COG is shown
							at the table below.</STRONG></P><P>
						The X axis shows the 20 sections of the genome size. And the Y
						axis is the frequency of the gene provided the COG. As a
						result to guess the distribution of gene by being provided COG,
						the graph provide an information that the COG is distributed
						symmetrically around the middle of origin.
