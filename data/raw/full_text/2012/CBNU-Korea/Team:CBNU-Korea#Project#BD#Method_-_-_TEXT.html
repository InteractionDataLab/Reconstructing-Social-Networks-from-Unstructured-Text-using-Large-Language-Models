1. BioBrick Database
- The program will be installed and run in the local       computer. When the program is distributed to the user. If the       whole information about BioBrick is included in the install       program, this will not only increase the size of the install file,       but also the user won’t need all of these informations. So we made       our program allow the users to choose the BioBrick information       that they want, and download it selectively.
- To bring the already registered BioBrick data, our program       parse and save the simple informations(ID, Name, Description,       Type) that is registered in       http://partsregistry.org/fasta/parts/All_Parts.
- All this saved information, will be shown in the download       screen for the user. By choosing the BioBrick that the user wants,       and pressing the download button, the Bricks information (Suparts,       Sequence, Status, Rating etc.) will be saved in the local database       after parsed by XML Part Information (http://partsregistry.org/       xml/part.+BioBrick Name).
- DB Tables
2. The user's BioBrick
- If the user wants to use a BioBrick with their own style,       not the BioBrick that is already registered in the program, they       can personally add a new BioBrick and design it.
3. Management of Sequence
3-1. Suffix, Prefix, Scar
- The program automatically process the restriction enzyme       between the Bricks when the user designs the BioBrick. By pressing       the ‘Scar’ icon and including the BioBrick in there, the program       will analyze the sequences of the Bricks and automatically choose       where to make the adequate Scar form.
3-2. Cloning
- When the user selects the Plasmid Backbone, the program       will check the sequence and find the restriction enzyme site. If       the Plasmid Backbone does not include in the restriction site of       Prefix, Suffix, then the user has to choose another plasmid       backbone.
- When the user choose one restriction site from each of       Prefix, Suffix and press the ‘OK’ button. it will process the       designed BioBrick and the Plasmid Backbone sequence and show it on       the screen.
4. Screen Shot function
- The teams participating the iGEM with experiments should       register first in BioBrick. In this process, the informations       about BioBricks in Wiki Pages and documents can be used through       graphic work.We hope that our program will lighten the load used       in those kind of progress, so the users can be more focused on the       experiment. This program is made to design and save the images at       the same time.
5. BioBrick Data Export
- Our program can save the BioBrick that the user designed       in various forms. The user can use the data right away without any       additional work.
5-1. SBOL
- SBOL(Synthetic Biology Open Language) is the exchange       standard for the genetic tools, the device modules, and the       explanation of the system data. We use libSBOLc(SBOL C library) to       save the designed information as a SBOL form, so that itcan be       easily transferred to the user.
5-2. Genbank
- This program is designed to save the information as       Genbank form, and we referred the form from       http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sitemap/samplerecord.
5-3. Fasta
- The Fasta file was made to be saved as seen in below.
