Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms       of:
- researcher safety,
During the time preparing for the Jamboree, health was the       most important thing for us. In order to consider the health, we       decided to study free except the time for conference or develop.       Especially, we had started the project on the beginning of march,       so the preparing time didn't pressured us.
- public safety, or
- environmental safety?
We do not exert a bad influence upon environment.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made       this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
- did you       document these issues in the Registry?
- how did you       manage to handle the safety issue?
- How could other       teams learn from your experience?
We do not have any connections with safety issue because we       do not make any new brick. However the unexpected software fault       can be cause a discomfort to user.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at       your institution?
- If yes, what does your local       biosafety group think about your project?
- If no, which       specific biosafety rules or guidelines do you have to consider in       your country?
Yes
There is the Safety Management System       is in our university. It contains 19 stipulations for       experimentation. However we haven't being managed by the system       because our project does not have a laboratory. ( http://safe.chungbuk.ac.kr/SafeLaw/Law01 )
