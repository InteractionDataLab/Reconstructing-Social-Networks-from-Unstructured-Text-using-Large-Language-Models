1. Sharing
The exchange of information is necessary in a study that confirm       and research a subject. Therefore, when the biologists do their       experiments, a process to exchange the experiment records and       results between the researchers is necessary as well.
By using a simple form of our program, it is able to exchange the       informations like the Brick designing process and the result data       between the researchers. By this program, not only you can       exchange the designing process in a file form, but you can also       exchange the components of BioBrick that was personally designed.       (i.g. By a fixed process, the BioBrick information that researcher       ‘A’ made, can be transferred and used by researcher ‘B’.) Also,       you can import or export the data as various forms(FASTA, Genbank,       SBOL) by the program itself. Because of this function, the       connectivity between the programs are enhanced, so the user and       the non-user of the program can exchange informations.
2. Human Practice
This program can show the exact cloning process in vitro by using       the Brick information that the user has chosen. Also, it can       produce usable knowledge of Synthetic Biology that will be needed.       Such as Brick informations or Restriction sites.
By proceeding the designing process before the actual experiment,       the beginners can participate more easily. Also you can utilize       the training software that can explain the visualized information       of the cloning process.
