1. Overview
- The importance of the transfer, saving and management of       bio-information is now closely related to the computers. Nowadays       bio-informatics are used in many fields from simple biological       models to complicated algorithm forecast and more. And in       synthetic biology, since designing a biological circuit by using       the computer became available, it has opened a new era. In the       past, synthetic biology used to find subjects like a genetic part       that is about a specific purpose and the connection between the       fastest designing process only by experiments. But now in the       future of synthetic biology, experiment and the computational       designing program must be in a mutual relationship. The purpose of       our project is to increase the efficiency of the experiment by       using the designing process of BioBrick prior to the experiment,       and improve the efficiency of the connection between the next       experiment conducted by the program user.
2. Feature
2-1. BioBrick Data Download
- The registered BioBrick information needed for designing       in this program, can be easily downloaded without being typed in.
2-2. Design
- The user can arrange the BioBrick in any sequence they       want. And if they want, the user can put a proper Prefix, Suffix       restriction enzyme site between the Bricks by the software.
- By selecting the Plasmid Backbone and the restriction       enzyme in sequence, the cloning will be done automatically.
2-3. Screen Shot
- The BioBrick that the user designed from the program is       saved in image files to be readily used in Wiki or documents.
2-4. Various Storage Formats
- The project in designing in progress can be saved or       imported. Also, by saving the informations as a SBOL, GenBank,       Fasta form, the user can use the information that they design in       other programs as well.
3. The process of the program designing
3-1. Problem Recognition
- In many common laboratories today, there is a limit that       the user themselves has to put in the BioBrick Data, and draw it       as an image after they finish the design. So we decided to develop       the designing a program that, based on BioBrick DataBase, directly       provide designing process with convenient additional functions as       well.
3-2. Requirement Checking
- We checked on other programs that many people are using       nowadays, and analyzed the steps that are needed in designing.
- For the connection within other programs that can be used       after the experiment, we checked on the needs of the saving       methods on GenBank, SBOL, Fasta.
3-2. Design
- Visual Studio 2010, 2012 (C#)
- Windows 7
- OleDB (MS OFFICE)
- * When running the program, Microsoft Runtime is required.
       X86 : Microsoft        Access 2010 Runtime Download        X64 : Microsoft        Access 2010 Runtime Download
3-2. Discussion and Feedback
- Our team members repeated testing the program, finding the       errors and fixing the problems.
4. Future Work
Our program is now version 1.0.0, and will be updated and       offer better information and performance about the designing       process in next versions. First, simplification of the       registration process of the iGEM Part will be offered. The       registration of BioBrick is now available only in online. But by       co-working with iGEM, we will develop a better functioning       program, and make it possible to design and register the Brick at       the same time. Secondly, we are planning to add a communication       function between the users. This function will help the users to       share opinions, and discuss designing information about a specific       Brick. This discussion will help the users improve their       experiment or project. Third, the expression rate will be produced       in a numerical value. The expression rate value is a score that       will show the users how the expression of the BioBrick designed by       cloning is working in the experiment. To make it as a score,       theoretical background and algorithm based on a lot of data are       required. The last is the import of the files with various saving       forms. Nowadays we can only save the designed BioBrick data after       exporting it. But the next version of the program will be improved       to read the data modified and saved in other process, and reading,       processing and saving it will be available as well.
