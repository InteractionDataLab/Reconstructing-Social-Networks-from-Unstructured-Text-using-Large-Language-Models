1. Introduction
1-1. Suggestion
Since the Genome project started in 2002, we can easily get       the genetic information of many species. Also as the scientific       technique developed, we can insert and compose the genome. If we       can design a whole genome, then we will be able to make a one and       only useful genome. But as today, the compose of the minimum       genome made with the essential gene has succeeded, but did not       last.
1-2. Object
To design a genome, we have to analyze the pattern of the       genome and the distribution of the gene.
1-3. Method and the range of the study
The study was used information of species in streptococcus by       patric database ( http://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Home ) and SynbUID.
The Data was built by mysql 5.5.27, and a statistical analysis       program was used by SAS 9.3.
2. Design
2-1. Prepare
1) Build database
An attribute of Genome name is consisted of ID, Genome_name, COG,       Start, End, Strand, and Size.
An attribute of Annotation       Table_EG is consisted of ID, locus, and SynbUID. Two entities are       paired of Locus_tag 1 by 1.
2) Represented sample number
For checking the number of specimen that is representative,       we used a simple random sampling method, and assumed that the       complete genome is random. We used the significance level (a=0.05)       and the limit of error (b=0.1). The total species of streptococcus       is 494 species, and between these, 82 species are completed.       According to our calculation, when there is 81 species, the result       is satisfied. Therefore, as a result, 82 complete species       represent the streptococcus.
3) Standard
3-1) Divided the interval of the genome
The number and size of the genome differs between species.       To supplement this problem, we divided the genes in a section to       show the genome’s size as a proportion. As a result, when we       divided the analyzing section less then a hundred, it was hard to       see the patterns because the data has been diluted. And when we       divided it into more then a hundred pieces, it was not that       different from the result that divided it into a hundred pieces.       So we decided to divide it into a hundred pieces.
3-2) Identified the starting point
The number one ORF of each gene sequence analysis data is different between every species. Thus we had to make a specific       standard to equalize the beginning of the data. We checked the       strand pattern of each genome and identified it with the strands.
2-2. Analysis
1) Strand
- We chose 77 species out of 82 species randomly, and       estimated the patterns of the strand ratio of each sections, and       verified the estimated number with the other 5 species.
- We checked the strand ratio of the essential gene.
2) Region
- We found the COG and the frequency of the essential gene       because of referred to the genome design
2-1) We checked where the essential genome is distributed.
2-2)       We checked where the gene by being provided COG is distributed.
3. Result
2-1. Strand
When we checked the strand pattern of the 82 species, the       genes were distributed in 4 places with different tendency. So we       decided the section of the proc transreg as 4, and analyzed.
1) Estimated the transpose linear regression
We explained with a theory that ‘The null hypothesis does       not satisfy the regression model, but the alternative hypothesis       does.’ As a result in the SAS, according to the null hypothesis,       the F-value was 3093.13, and the P=value <.0001. Therefore at a       significance level of 0.01, the null hypothesis is dismissible. In       other words, the regression model is more suitable.
2) Estimated factor β0, β1
As the notable probability gets smaller, it can affect the       dependent variable more. According to the null hypothesis, the       F-value of β0 is 10.13, and the Pr > F 0.0015. So the null       hypothesis is dismissable. And the estimated calculation is       1.22744031. Also F-value of β1 was 3093.13, and the Pr > F <.0001, so again the null hypothesis is dismissed. Therefore, the       estimated number is 0.97546498.
3) Estimated the transe regression model
As a result to look the distribution of the strand to each       species, we found a similar pattern. Thus we studied the pattern       of the strand distribution after to range a standard by section       which is changed the strand's sign. By using The Transpose       Regression Method, we have a result to be able to express The       Spline Regression Model by the distribution pattern of the strand       of 82 species.
Identity(spercent) = 1.22744031       + 0.97546498*spline(interval)
The X axis shows the 100 sections of the genome of the       randomly selected 77 species. And the Y axis is the ratio of the +       patterns of each section. The sum of each section’s +, - pattern       is 100. According to the graph above, when the standard number is       50, the + patterns appears as 25 on the left, and the – pattern on       the right higher than 80. So in this case, it is a + pattern.
4) Verifying the estimated Prediction Equation is        adequate.
By conducting the chi-square test with the estimated       transpose linear regression prediction equation with the 77       randomly selected species, we verified if the equation is       adequate. The null hypothesis is independent from the prediction       equation and the other 5 species that was not selected. And the       alternative hypothesis is subordinate with the prediction equation       and the 5 species. The p-value of the 5 species is independent       from the prediction equation estimated by the null hypothesis. We       can see that it is subordinate when it is dismissed.
2-2. Region
We estimated the origin which is a part of changed strand’s       pattern.
1) The spread of the essential genes is shown at        the table below.
The X axis shows the 20 sections of the genome size. And the       Y axis is the frequency of the genome. As a result to guess the       distribution of the essential gene, the graph is showed like that.       We know that 322 essential genes among 485 essential gene are       distributed a bilateral symmetry in the middle of origin. We can       divide between the Synb_ID which is the origin of high frequency       and Synb_ID which is the origin of high frequency by both sides.
2) The spread of the genes provided COG is shown        at the table below.
The X axis shows the 20 sections of the genome size. And the Y       axis is the frequency of the gene provided the COG.
As a       result to guess the distribution of gene by being provided COG,       the graph provide an information that the COG is distributed       symmetrically around the middle of origin.
