AID is known to be responsible for somatic hypermutation and the class-switch recombination of immunoglobulin in B cells. This enzyme of 28 kDa originally occurs in B cells but does also show activity after transfection into CHO cells. AID induces the deamination of cytidine to uridine at actively transcribed single strand DNA. The replacement of cytidine by uridine leads to a mismatch during DNA replication and integrates a single base substitution predominantly in the immunoglobulin genes.
Therefore this enzymes was used in our project for diversification of antibodies.With PCR and cloning we developed AID`s for the differnt requirements.

After certain expression time we purified the the single chain plasmids and transformed them into <I>E. coli</I> to enrich the mutated plasmids. After overnight culture and purification of the transformed plasmids, samples where sequenced. 
There is a significant higher mutation rate when wildtype AID, modified AID or modified AID-eGFP is added,  compared to the same experiment without AID. Surprisingly, the mutation rate of wt AID is two times higher than the mutation rate of the modified AID or modified AID-eGFP (Figure 4). This observation is contrary to our expectation. The modified AID+eGFP is located in the nucleus (Figure 5), that means our construct works and should have a higher mutation rate. One possible explanation is that the modified AID has a very high mutation rate and therefore the transfected cells die or inactivate the plasmid like it was observed for the wildtype AID (Martin and Scharff (2002)).</P><P><B>Green fluorescence reporter</B>:

<P>The fluorescence microscope images(Figure 5) show transfected cells A)with &quot;modified AID+eGFP&quot; (BBa_K929003)and B)with &quot;modified AID+eGFP&quot; (BBa_K929003) and a mCherry labeled nanobody construct (BBa_K929107)]]. &quot;Modified AID+eGFP&quot; (BBa_K929003)proved to be located in the nucleus.

Therefore we would expect an increased mutation rate with &quot;modified AID+eGFP&quot; but as described above the experimental setup possible can not reflect this. It is also shown that transfected cells(green nucleus, Figure 5 A&amp;B) can be discriminated from not transfected (grey, Figure 5). This can be used for a fast selection of transfected cells via FACS. Figure 5 B shows that &quot;modified AID+eGFP&quot; can be used in combination with an other fluorescence labeld construct (mCherry labeled nanobody construct ,BBa_K929107) and co transfected cells can be easily found or selected via FACS. </P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Selection_BioBricks">Selection BioBricks</SPAN></H3><TABLE border="1"><TBODY><TR><TD><A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K929200" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K929200</A> N-terminal sortase motif linked to AAV2-VP2 with Myc-tag, kozak and CMV </TD><TD><P>N-terminal sortase motif is required for being ligate to several Proteins with the C-terminal sortase motif.

The original PLICing is based on the amplification of insert and backbone to ligate them together by knocking out thiophosphates at the 3' end. For the Potsdam Standard, we designed a new cloning vector with an RFP expression cassette as insert and two new restriction enzyme recognition sites in the suffix and prefix in pSB1C3. In the prefix we added the Apa I recognition site and in the suffix the Sph I recognition site. Both enzymes causing a 3â overhang with 4 nucleotides. For the cloning process we cut the vector with Apa I and Sph I. In this assembly standard thatâs the only step where we have to use restriction enzymes.
The insert was amplified with primers that contain 4 phosphothioate nucleotides and the recognition sites for Apa I and Sph I at the 5â end. After incubation in an iodine/ethanol solution the thiophosphates were cut out resulting in a 3â overhang which is suitable to the overhangs that was created by cutting the new assembly vector.
After that the digested vector and the PLICed insert were mixed and transformed into <I>E. coli</I>. By using the RFP expression cassette we created a ligation control system. Due to the fact that red fluorescent colonies have a failed vector ligation we can tell which colonies are correctly ligated. The colonies that do not show red fluorescence are the positive clones.

We tested different combination to prove the most efficient experimental design. Therefore, we tried four different conditions: the ligation of the pliced GOI with the unpurified digested backbone with and without ligase and the ligation of the pliced GOI with the purified digested backbone with and without ligase. After transformation, we picked only clones which have lost their red fluorescence indicating that the ligation was successful (Figure 9).
To quantify the results, we counted the red colonies and the colonies without red fluorescence (Figure 10). It is obvious, that the ligation with the electrophoretic purified digested backbone is more efficient than without any purification. Nevertheless, the use of ligase is not necessary for the ligation process under these conditions.</P><TABLE class="table center" border="0"><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:402px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 7:</B> Overnight culture of transformed <I>E. coli</I></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD><TD><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:402px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 8:</B> After centrifugation, the cell pellets are coloured like cherries</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR><TR><TD><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:402px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 9:</B> Results of different ligation conditions</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD><TD><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:402px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption"><B>Figure 10:</B> Results of different ligation conditions</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
