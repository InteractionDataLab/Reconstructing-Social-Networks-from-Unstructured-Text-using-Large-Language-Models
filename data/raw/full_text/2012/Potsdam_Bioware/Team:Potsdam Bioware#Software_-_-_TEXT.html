BioLog Software
Last year the Potsdam Team developed BioLog Software. This application is a featured program for scientists with smart phones. Everyone can easily either download an already existing protocol or write his own procedure in a simple Plist Editor. The improvement of this application in this year is preparation of a few new ready protocols – ready to use. Additionally, some of the elements were developed to make your science life much easier. For example: we added a QR/datamatrix code import, file system access and log file generation.
Make your science life more organized!
The BioLog app helps you get prepared to work in the lab as well as lead your lab life. Especially for you we developed an application in which you can:
1. Browse/follow many protocols at the same time
2. Make sure that all the devices, solutions and materials are ready – the checkbox option is there for you!
3. Scan the chemicals that you used via Barcode Scanner
4. Comment on every step
5. Thanks to the preprogrammed timer, you don’t need to search for the timer in the lab space – you just use it on your phone
Download and try it yourself: you will be astonished!
Here you can download the BioLog Software.
The recent version of the app is available on our site http://www.betterprotocols.org .
The .zip archive contains the app, the protocols and a readme.txt file which contains instructions for installing the app.
We tested the App on the following devices:
- HTC Desire
- HTC Wildfire
- Samsung Galaxy S2
- Samsung Galaxy Nexus
- Samsung Galaxy S+
- Samsung G5500
- Samsung Galaxy Tab (first version)
- Sony Xperia
- Packard Bell Liberty Tab G100
Feedback on other devices whether the app is working or not, is welcome. Thanks!
