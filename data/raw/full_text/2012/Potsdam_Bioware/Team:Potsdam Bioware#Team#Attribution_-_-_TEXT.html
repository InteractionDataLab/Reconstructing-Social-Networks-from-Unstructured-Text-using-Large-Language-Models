The planning and the effort to realize our project was done in independent work by students participating in the competition. The attribution of each student is presented in detail in the lab journal and meetings protocols.
We are greatly thankful to our supervisors Prof. Dr. Katja Arndt and Dr. Kristian Müller for their support, help, advice and the possibility to realize our project.
We are very thankful for the helpful technical hints from the PhD. Students: Tim, Tobias, Stefan and Sven which were given us throughout our project.
Technical support and help was offered to us by Franzi. Thank you for autoclaving our glassware and taking care of the waste.
We owe a great thank you to apl. Prof. Otto Baumann for letting us use the confocal microscope, Prof. Dr. Silke Leimkühler and co-workers for TEV Protease and tips about CHO cell culturing, Prof. Dr. Michael Lehnhard for providing the DNA gel documentation station, Prof. Dr. Zoya Ignatova and co-workers for giving us the primers for colony PCR and G418 (Gentamycin) and Dr. Katja Hanack for pCEP4 vector and MACS column.
Additionally, we are are thankful for the helpful discussion with Felix Oden about the handling of CHO cells with Flp-In system.
Thanks to Dr. Lothar Lehnhardt for helping us organising the day of Synthetic Biology in Potsdam.
