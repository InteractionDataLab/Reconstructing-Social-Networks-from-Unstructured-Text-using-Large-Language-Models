1 Safety questions:
1.1 1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues concerning researchers, the public or the environment?
1.2 2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
1.3 3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
1.4 4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
Safety questions:
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues concerning researchers, the public or the environment?
The current project and further project ideas of the Potsdam Bioware Team 2012 are classified as biosafety level one (S1) work. None of the ideas do raise additional safety issues to the public, the environment or researchers. We comply with safety regulations given by the law and its amendments, including but not limited to handling and storage of genetically modified organisms and the documentation of the work.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
No, none of our generated BioBrick parts or devices will raise any safety issues concerning the public or the environment.
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
The University of Potsdam supervises biological and chemical laboratories and works according to federal and state regulations. A local biosafety officer has been appointed for the lab and the project. About twice a year, the laboratory is physically inspected by the state Authority for Biotechnological Laboratories to ensure compliance with the law and regulations. In Germany, the work with genetically modified organisms is regulated by the ‘Law on Genetic Engineering’ (Gesetz zur Regelung der Gentechnik, GenTG) and amendments of the ”Gentechnik-Sicherheitsverordnung (GenTS)”, the “Gentechnik-Verfahrensverordnung (GenTVfV)” and the “Gentechnik-Aufzeichnungsverordnung (GenTAufzV)”.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
With the beginning widespread use of synthetic genes, devices and systems the standard safety classification based on originating and accepting organism is becoming less appropriate. A more abstracted view of BioBricks with respect to their function and potential interference at the molecular, cellular and organismic level is advised. Known as well as potential risks could be listed in a specific section for each BioBrick in the Partsregistry. In addition to the safety assessment, each iGEM group could give a short assessment of the technology impact based on intended and, if applicable, unintended use.
