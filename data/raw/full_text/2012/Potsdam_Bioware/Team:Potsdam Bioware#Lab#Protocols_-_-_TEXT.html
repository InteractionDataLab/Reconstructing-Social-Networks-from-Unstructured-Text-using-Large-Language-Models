Procedure
1) Use bottles or tubes that are set aside for RNA work. Harvest 15ml cells by centrifugation for approx. 2 minutes @ 2500g. Cells should make a nice pellet.
2) Discard the supernatant and take up the all liquid with a pipette.

4) Set up 2ml tubes for phenol/CHCl3 extractions
5) Extract cell suspension with 600µl ml Phenol/CHCl3/Isoamyl Alcohol (25:24:1, e.g. Roti© from ROTH) and shake well for 1 minute
6) Centrifuge @ 12000g for 5 minutes.
7) Collect upper, aqueous phase (avoid interphase material) and repeat steps 5-7. (Total of 4 Phenol/CHCl3 extractions. Do not worry if phase is pink.)
8) After second extraction add 6µl of 4mg/ml proteinase K solution (Roche) and incubate for 10 min at 65°C.
9) Repeat the steps 6-8 twice.
10) Transfer the upper, aqueous phase to a new tube.
11) Extract the upper with 400µl CHCl3/Isoamyl Alcohol to reduce phenol concentration.
12) Centrifuge 2,5 minutes @ 12000g.
13) Take upper, aqueous phase and transfer to a new 1,5ml tube.

Make DNA Ladder Mix (Gene Ruler, Thermo Scientific) ready to use
if you work with Gelred DON`T follow the instructions from Thermo Scientific ! DNA-Ladder must be diluted 10x stronger because Gelred is very sensitiv. In the end the DNA Ladder must be diluted 1:60 in 1x Loading Dye Solution.
Example: Mix 10 µl DNA Ladder, 120 µl 5x Loading Dye Solution and 470 µl deionized wather --> 600 µl Ladder ready to use
