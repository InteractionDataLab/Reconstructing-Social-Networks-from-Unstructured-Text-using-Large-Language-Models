</SPAN></H3><P>This year we interviewed six Members of the German parliament (Bundestag) affiliated with two different parties, the CDU and the SPD, as well as members of the squad for economy and environment of the Pirate party. Furthermore, we met the German Minister of Education, Mrs. Prof. Schavan. In the following sections we summarize the interviews.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_Pirate_Party_Germany">The Pirate Party Germany</SPAN></H4><DIV class="thumb tright"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:302px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Interview with the Pirate Party Berlin</DIV></DIV></DIV><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Details_about_the_Pirate_Party_Germany">Details about the Pirate Party Germany</SPAN></H5><P>
The Pirate Party Germany is an alternative party which combines different political directions. The party demands direct democracy, transparency and freedom of information. That is why they are critical with copyright and patent law. Currently the party is not member of the German Bundestag but represented in some Landtagen (parliament of German constitutive federal states). We got the chance to meet the Berlin Squad for economy and environment on 6th September 2012. The Members of  the Squad tried to answer our questions about Synthetic Biology. It has to be mentioned, that the given answers are not the opinion of the whole Pirate Party, only of the Berlin Squad for economy and environment.<A href="/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=Http://www.piratenpartei.de/" class="new" title="Http://www.piratenpartei.de/">Homepage Pirate Party Germany</A></P><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Statements_on_Synthetic_Biology">Statements on Synthetic Biology</SPAN></H5><P> 
Primarily, we promote science and also demand the financial support  of projects. Nevertheless, we see also the risks and potentially danger of  Synthetic Biology. In the worst case we would abstain from gaining knowledge about a topic if there is danger associated with it. 
Nevertheless there is a great potential of Synthetic Biology for example to avoid animal experiments. However, we see the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment very critical. For example, we would not have supported the disposal of genetically  modified bacteria to combat the Exxon Valdez catastrophe 1989. 
Two points are very important, because they are official positions of Pirate Party Germany. Firstly, we demand free access to  information for society because we don´t see danger for the public safety. In our opinion, the withholding of information promotes illegal behavior. Therefore, we strictly refuse military research. That is the reason why we demand the support of public research. That is also a part of the second point: when we financially support companies the results have to be freely accessible for the public without any constraints. Finally we recommend a survey in any case of public interest.</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Dr._Max_Lehmer">Dr. Max Lehmer</SPAN></H4>

Synthetic  Biology  is  one  of  the  most  exciting  science  fields.  There  is  a  great  potential 
associated with Synthetic Biology which we can and should use. Specially, the green genetic 
engineering  provides  us  with  many  possibilities  to  respond  to  future  challenges  such  as 
climate change. That is the reason why we should financially support companies developing 
Synthetic Biology and German teams participating in the iGEM competition. Of course, there 
are  some  risks  and  uncertainties.  Nevertheless, we  should  use  the  possibilities  of  Synthetic 
Biology in form of genetically modified organisms to meet the world’s need for food, to cure
diseases or even to attenuate the consequences of ecological disasters.
To increase public acceptance for Synthetic Biology, it is important that scientists, politicians 
and other citizens work together, for example in a civic dialogue. In my opinion this process 
is very important, because the refusal of genetically modified organisms in our daily life, for 
example in our food, will not be sustainable in the light of the increasing market potential and 
possibilities of Synthetic Biology in the future. Furthermore, I think that the German public 
and politics overreact to the topic of Synthetic Biology or genetic engineering in general.
Although Synthetic Biology provides us with many useful tools to modify and change genetic 
information,  it  can also  be  used  to  genetically  generate dangerous  biological  material  like 
Dutch  scientists  did  with  the  H5N1  virus  in  2011. Nevertheless, information  should  not  be 
restrained. In contrast, we have to discuss the problems more transparently.</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Mechthild_Heil">Mechthild Heil</SPAN></H4>

Synthetic Biology is a field with great potential. This new scientific field offers totally different possibilities to examine DNA chains. Although we have controversial discussions in the media, we should take the opportunity to try this new approach.
The parliament supports various projects. Synthetic Biology is a long term project which offers a lot of chances. Therefore we should think about financial assistance to support this emerging project.  In order to enable companies to establish themselves on the market, the financially support should be restricted to a certain time period. 
Information is the key element for approaching new ideas, especially in the technological field. Thus we, as politicians, have the duty to inform the people about advantages and risks of Synthetic Biology. If people understand the potential of Synthetic Biology, the acceptance will increase. Therefore a transparent and open dialog between stakeholders and society is necessary.
In my opinion the resistance to genetically modified organism is not sustainable in the future. There is a great difference in the law on genetically modified organisms between Germany and other countries in the world.
Despite the great potential of the Synthetic Biology we also should think about the risks of the Synthetic Biology and the genetically modified organisms. With the law on genetic engineering and negotiated agreements of the companies we have instruments to handle almost all safety questions in Germany. There are also negative aspects, such as the example of the modified H5N1 virus 2011 which underlines the conflict between open source information and public safety. Thus, it is very important to publish information openly without any constraints.</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Ren.C3.A9_R.C3.B6spel">René Röspel</SPAN></H4>

In general it is difficult to find a clear separation between Synthetic Biology and genetic engineering. Nevertheless, it has to be mentioned that this new scientific field provides many advantages but also a new exposure to risks which has to be discussed. 
Firstly, we have to be careful with the hope we set in Synthetic Biology. Surely there are problems which can be solved by the Synthetic Biology. But nevertheless, there are problems which have to be resolved in a different way, a political and social way, for example the world’s need for food. 
Secondly, we should not ignore the risks of the Synthetic Biology. That is the reason why education of the people is an important aspect. Not only politicians but also scientists have the duty to inform the people about dangers. Especially scientists have not only the freedom of scientific work but also the responsibility to assume an obligation for their own work. For difficult safety questions, for example the modified H5N1 virus, it is important to have both: the scientist’s self-control and the public control. 
Because of unsolved safety questions, we have the opinion that we in Germany should be critical with genetically modified organisms and should try to abstain from those genetically modified organisms which directly serve as food, for example maize. For genetically modified organisms that produce proteins or other metabolites which are used as ingredients we trust in process technology to hinder contamination with these organisms. 
In the end we should support research and development in the field of Synthetic Biology. However, we think that it does not make sense to give financial support to companies because we as representatives of the German population have to support public projects and not commercial projects. For the iGEM competition, we should think about giving financial support to the German teams, for example in form of travel costs. Nevertheless, we have to consider also other teams in other competitions which need financial support.

</P><H5><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Statements_on_Synthetic_Biology_5">Statements on Synthetic Biology</SPAN></H5><P>Many people pin their hope on Synthetic Biology. This new scientific field has a great potential to develop new drugs and synthesize or harness new forms of energy. Nevertheless, scientists should be careful with two things: the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and the education of the public about advantages and risks of Synthetic Biology. For the first point, it is very important to promote research in this field to estimate the risks of release. Surely, the use of genetically modified organisms to meet the world’s need for food, to attenuate the consequences of ecological disasters, or to prevent animal experiments should be discussed, but the scientists have to be careful with GMOs and should spend more research on the consequences.
With regard to public education, green genetic engineering shows us that many people refuse the practical application of this scientific field. Therefore, every scientist has the duty to inform the public about Synthetic Biology and present in laymen words his or her research to improve understanding, because we have to rely on scientists who can estimate risks and danger more competent. For this point, it is also important to know that research has limits which were created by religion and ethics. That is the reason why we offer ethical support for companies. To put it into a nut shell, research should be used for the collective good. Therefore, I think that information should not be restricted although some information has a dangerous potential. Transparency is very important in science and should be protected.
