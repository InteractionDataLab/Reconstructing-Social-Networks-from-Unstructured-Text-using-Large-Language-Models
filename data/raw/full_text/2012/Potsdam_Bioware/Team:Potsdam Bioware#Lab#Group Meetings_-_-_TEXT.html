Group Meetings
Summary 2012-03-12
presentation of topics, progress and deepening of projects
Attendees: Christopher, Tom S., Rico, Kevin, Kerstin, Sascha, Mario, Tom O.
magnetosome-beads: Christopher
idea: functionalization of magnetic beads with proteins display method with magnetic beads:
knock-out mutant for magnetosomes – biosynthesis and transformation with essential gene
for protein interaction, transcribtion of gene and biosynthesis of magnetosomes
purification with magnetic force
problems & to do: which stains are suitable? ‘’Magnetospirillum WT‘‘ or ‘‘E.coli‘‘ transformation?
hypermutated antibody by transfection: Rico
idea: improvement of antibody affinity through integrated deaminase which leads to hypermutation
cell line with antibody + Fc-receptor for antibody presentation on surface
virus with antigen on envelope that can be bind specifically by antibody and releases incorpo-rated deaminase gene into cell
hypermutation
test for affinity
problems & to do: mechanism of hypermutation? CHO cell line (able to hypermutate sequences?) or myeloma cells?
voltage responding proteins: Sascha
idea: linkage of proteins to voltage sensitive transmembrane domains
application for voltotaxis via PI3-kinase for example
problems & to do: stability without membrane connection?
Next meeting: Wednesday 4th April at 5 pm,  B0.01 H25!
Summary 2012-04-04
Deepening of project ideas Attendees: Christopher, Tom S., Rico, Kevin, Kerstin, Sascha, Tom O. Presentation of project by Rico
hypermutation by protein E2 of Hepatitis C Virus
protein E2 leads to hypermutation in B-cells by activation of AID through CD81 (activation in-duced Deaminase)
3 concepts:
myeloma cells with antibody on surface. Addition of E2 and virus with antigen on surface + siRNA against AID – reduction of AID activity after virus binding
myeloma cells that secrete antibody, addition of E2 and antigen on surface  - saturation of virus by improved antibody
myeloma cells that secrete antibody and AID knock-out, addition of virus with AID on surface and E2 – induction of hypermutations through binding
(E2 with linker peptide and antigen)  to do:  are there any publications that describe E2? Is the mechanism of action well known? Why is CD81 important and which cells lines are robust enough to survive the pathway? How can you control CD81? How long does the hypermutation take? How is it possible to select cells? idea: patent, peptide linker for BioBrick, DNA-Origami as linker? magnetosomes
talk to people from the MPI, exists any application for the project mentioned above?
Next meeting: Friday, 13th April, 8 am (Vorlesungszeitraum)
Summary 2012-04-20
Attendees: Tom S., Rico S., Tom O., Kevin S., Mario K., Tobias P., Kerstin W., Xenia A., Barbara M., Katharina T., Stefan G., Maria K., Tarek S., Christopher K., Sascha L., Laura R. 1. reminder: all team members have to register for wiki! 2. presentation of wiki page and editing of wiki (Tom)  Presentation was uploaded! 3. deepening of the project
A. magnetosomes (Christopher): idea was rejected, preparation/creation of knock-out mutants would have been too time consuming and can thus not be realized and additionally a lot of genetic know-how would have been needed
B. hypermutation by protein E2 of Hepatitis C Virus (Rico)
protein E2 leads to hypermutation in B-cells by activation of AID via CD81 (activation induced Deaminase) idea und goal of the project:
increasing antibody -activity and specificity + adjustable hypermutation by AID
binding of virus-antigen to antibody on surface of beads have to be selected
cells to be used: CHO
possible stages of the project:
induction of hypermutation
transfection of cells with antibody
transfection of AID + detection/proof of hypermutation
binding of virus particles to antibody on surface
Establishment of selection system
Which steps can be realized during the project?
antibody on cell surface?
can virus bind?
to do:
possible usage of camellid antibody?
is a switchable expression of surface-antibody by Tet on/off- or Cre-Lox-system possible?
C. Adeno-assoziated Virus = AAV (Tarek)
idea:
using AAV as vector, transforming transgenes (GOI) between ITRs (inverted terminal repeats) of AAV
multiplication of transgenes would be possible via helper plasmid and not non-pathogenic AAV helper plasmids
Advantage: good purification possible, expression can be controlled Disadvantage: expression "without help" slowly, possible damage of genes by undirected integra-tion
Next meeting: Friday 27th of April 8:00 am (Vorlesungszeitraum)
Following tasks have to be prepared:
iGEM-judging criteria, creating time table (Kevin)
iGEM-requirements for cloning and Biobricks (Maria & Laura)
Sponsoring (Kathi, Mario & Tom)
topical focus:
How to design the virus construct? (Tobias, Xenia und Tarek)
Transfection von camellid-AK (Sascha)
AID-specificity (Rico, Chris) Chris will start with the following paper Paper or already known?
Tet-on/Tett-off- und Cre-Lox-systeme for switchable expression (Tom & Stefan)
--> to Rico and Tarek: could you maybe upload your presentation from the 20th April?

Summary 2012-08-06
Attendees: Tom S., Rico, Chris, Sascha, Maria, Kristian, Tobi
Protocol: Tom
Moderation: Rico
group planning:
(antibody): 1st week: small construct (transient/stable transfection, integrated 6th week), 3rd week big construct (transient/stable integrated 8th week)
(AID): 1st week: finishing everything, 2nd week: localization of modified AID, 3rd week: muta-tion rate with color change, (4th week) collaboration with Freiburg
(Virus): 3rd week: EGFR+ sortase construct and virus+ sortase construct, 5th week: virus is ready
virus: 3 variations of selection system: thymidin deaminase, antibiotic resistance, color reaction  (dye should be compatible with GFP and mCherry)
phage display: Arabinose promoter fused to non-modified AID with Amp resistance, Tim should be consulted (analogy to NEB protocol)
Next meeting: Friday at 10:00 am
Summary 2012-08-10
Attendees: Tom S., Rico, Chris, Stefan, Laura, Tobias
Protocol: Chris
Moderation: Tom S.
progress report:
(Antibody): search for Cre recombinase (Maria), important: cross interaction of cre recombinase and Flp-recombinase?
Big antibody construct will be too late for stable transfection till jamboree, can be transfected transiently, FACS for expression testing
Small construct is read for transfection, sequencing results will arrive soon, will be used for testing the AIDs mutation potential
(AID): weaker promoter for collaboration project with Freiburg, sequence specificity can possibly get lost with a high expression rate, first tests if expression with weaker promoter is useful
Phage display planning:
Plan: Transformation of ‘‘E. coli‘‘ with AID and phage vector, (new competent cells are needed) Induction of AID with arabinose 1 h before transformation of cells with vector Pak 100 (witht scFV 425- anti EGFR), adding helper phages afterwards
(Virus): selection for virus infection with which fluorescence protein? --> CFP? Leads to no inter-ferences with GFP,YFP and mCherry disadvantage: weak fluorescence
Modeling: Tobias calculated and analyzed several parameter
Model shows that there should be a definite difference in affinity of template antibody to mutated antibody so that selection system can work properly (too high affinity of our antibody?)
task allocations
Kathi: hotel and flight details for Amsterdam
Hotel: 2 nights, cheap, close to Uni
Flight: favorite way of travelling to Amsterdam

Summary 2012-08-31
Attendees: Basia, Stefan, Sascha, Kerstin, Chris, Xenia, Kathi, Rico, Tom
Presenter: Tom
Protocol: Maria
1.progress report:
Virus:
- pcBIC Plasmid is sequenced
- HEK cells are transfected with 4 plasmids for virus production (plasmid with YFP and CFP)
- Another GOI with “survival signal” should be designed!!
AID:
- All Biobricks (5 so far) are finished, got a number and are fully sequenced; just TAL domain is missing
- German names have to be translated
- Another Biobrick: Wt-AID-GFP = new standard can be used?
Phagemid Display:
- Difficulties with restriction enzyme digestion (was repeated in thermo cycler) and with purifica-tion/separation of single cut from double cut on gel
Antibody:
- Adjusting the transfection protocol is finished, transfection conditions are settled
- Clon 4 was transfected transient last week, pictures have to be taken with higher magnifica-tion
- But: fluorescence intensity was not high enough, repetition of experiment?
- Detection of antibody on surface with anti-FLAG-Tag antibody, secondary labeled antibody can be seen in microscope
- Start of long-time experiments with cmv-venus (48h over weekend)
- Cells are prepared for stable transfection
- GeneArt construct arrived!!!!
- Primers ordered for production of Biobricks
2. Episomal vector for longer transient transfection of antibody construct???
3. Measurement and data (needed!!!) for our project
- Mutations by AID: Sequencing of the antibody-fragment, search for sequence altered by AID
Idea: AID able to mutate specificity of antibody fragment for YFP to CFP ???
- Switch form on surface presented to secreted antibody fragment
- Selection system with virus
4. Virus
- Virus selection system needs to be able to distinguish between antibody/no-antibody on sur-face
- Possibilities of selection: death signal, survival signal (antibiotic resistance), fluorescence signal (CFP)
Signal
Surface
GOI
fluorescence signal
YFP
CFP
fluorescence signal
CFP
YFP
death signal
…
TK
death signal
…
CD
survival signal
…
antibiotic resistance signal which kills resting cells or use of selective media
- Find an antibiotic which is eligible for selection and orthogonal to Hygromycin
- Neomycin, Gentamycin????
5. Selection of CHO cells with antibody construct
- FACS of Potsdam antibody group still out of order
- Magnetic beats for selection
- FACS core facility at DRFZ
Important: phenol red free media has to be ordered for preparation
6. Assembly standard
- Biobrick standard vector, introduces compatibility
- Disadvantage: more expensive primers, ligase is still needed
- Advantage: much faster and vector doesn’t need to be amplified
7. Touch screen TV
- Collecting information
Idea: 4 smaller once instead of 1 big ones
8. Cre recombinase
– ordered from Addgene
9. Wiki/homepage
- Information/ ideas under UP12_ wiki-web-design
Important: suggestions for project name!!!!!
Next meeting: Tuesday, 04.09.12, 4 pm

summary 2012-09-11
Attendees: Xenia, Tobias, Chris, Rico, Stefan, Basia, Kathi, Tom S., Kristian, Kerstin, Maria, Sascha
Protocol: Basia Tops:
1. Progress report
a) Phage display:
- the first round will be ready tomorrow
- 1 plate (double mutated with AID) had only 1 colony - maybe too strong mutation? -> let's try to reduce the arabinose concentration
- 3 others had many positive clones
b) AID group
- news from sequencing: wtAID mutates stronger than the mod. AID
- other probes from different times will be sent for sequencing tomorrow
- split the cells earlier?
c) Virus
- Things from Sven are there - available (missing plasmids and primers)
- Transfection tomorrow
- Do we do magnetic beads? Do we stay with Virus and FACS only as a selection system?
d) Antibody
- we need the cells with stably transfected antibody - Kerstin will do that until Friday but the cells won't be happy!
- Basia and Chris will express YFP and CFP for magnetic beads selection system
e) Modeling
- Comparison between deterministic and stochastic model: stochastic model is better
- we should apply the law of mass action
2. Biobricks - who writes what?
- Write an email to iGEM headquarters: is genebank format available? what features should it have?
- everyone should write the texts but only 2 or three people should put it on the parts registry - see the BioBrick page and self-assign
3. Internetseite
4. Poster
5. FACS
- Maria and Stefan will call the DRFZ.
