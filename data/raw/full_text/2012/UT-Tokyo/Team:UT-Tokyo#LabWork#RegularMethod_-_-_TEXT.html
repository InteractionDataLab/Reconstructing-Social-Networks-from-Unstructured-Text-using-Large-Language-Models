Assembly parts
Digestion
Materials
Plasmid
10x buffer
100x Acet BSA
Emzyme (EcoR I, Xba I, Spe I, Pst I)
Protocol
1. Add plasmid
MilliQ up to 20uL
2uL 10x H or M buffer
0.2uL BSA
0.5uL emzyme I
0.5uL emzyme II
2. Incubation at 37 °C for more than two hour.
Ligation
Materials
Vector DNA
Insert DNA
2x Ligation Mix
Protocol
1. Make reaction liquid
MilliQ up to 20uL
10uL 2x Ligation Mix
Vector DNA
Insert DNA
2. Incubation at 16 °C for 15-30 min.
Transformation
Materials
BioBrick parts / ligation products
SOC or LB (No antibiotic) 500uL
TE 15uL
plates
competent cells
Protocol
to thaw out igem parts
1. With a pipette tip, punch a hole in the foil
2. Add 15uL of TE (MilliQ),and pipetting
3. Pipette 1uL of the resuspended DNA Transformation into your desired competent cells
4. Hold on ice for 30 min.
5. Heat shock at 42°C for 45 seconds (and on ice after it)
6. Add 300uL of LBborth in each epp
7. Wait for 10 mins
8. Hold at 37°C for 30 min.
(this step can be skipped with ampicillin selection)
9. Plate out
10. Incubate at 37°C
Purification of DNA
Miniprep
Material
kit of Promega (SVMinipreps)
incubative tube
1.5mL epp tube
MilliQ
Protocol
1. pour contents out of the incubative tube into the 1.5mL tube as you can
2. centrifuge for 10min (15,000rpm)
(you can centrifuge incubative tube directly when it can endure up to 6,000g )
3. throw supernatant fluid away not to damage the precipitation
( you should decant by using yellow tip first / remove culture medium as you can / throw waste water away in bio hazard!)
4.add 250uL cell resuspension solution (red label)、suspend completely
(incomplete suspending decreases yields / you should use epp stand like a washboard)
5. add 250uL Cell lysis solution（green label）
6. turn the tube upside down four times slowly not to bubble
7. add 10uL Alkalin Protease Sol. （small bottle）
8. turn the tube upside down four times slowly not to bubble
9. wait for 5min （Be careful not to exceed 5min! colon bacillus will disintegrate too much!）
10. add 350uL Neutralization Sol. (blue label）
11. turn the tube upside down four times slowly not to bubble
12. centrifuge for 10min (15,000rpm)
13. put the supernatant fluid to column (germ’s wreckage is adhering below)
14. centrifuge for 1min (15,000rpm)
15. throw flow through (the liquid in the tube below) away
16. add 750uL Wash Sol. to column and centrifuge for 1min (15,000rpm)
17. throw flow through away, put 250μL Wash Sol. to column and centrifuge for 1min (15,000rpm)
18. change the column into 1.5ml tube and centrifuge for 2min (15,000rpm)
19. change the tube into new one and add 50uL MilliQ
(use Nucleas-Free Water in the kit instead of MilliQ)
20. centrifuge for 1min (15,000rpm) after waiting for 1min
21. take 1 to 1.5uL and determine the concentration by NanoDrop (Don’t dilute)
22. label them
Gel extraction, PCR clean-up
Material
kit of Promega (SVMinipreps)
Gel
Protocol
1. Gel Slice and PCR Product Preparation
Dissolving the Gel Slice  *Cut out gel with wanted band and put it in a tube.  *Add 3 parts Mem. binding sol. to 1 part Gel volume.
Processing PCR Amplifications  *Add an equal volume of Membrane Binding Solution to the PCR amplification.
2. Shake & Incubate at 50-65 degrees C until gel is completly dissolved.
3. Put in the column.
4. Centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 1 minute
5. Empty collection tube and add 700 ul Mem. Wash sol, centrifuge for 1 minute.
6. Empty collection tube and add 500 ul Mem. Wash sol, centrifuge for 1 minute.
7. Change the column to a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf and centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 1 minute.
8. Change the old tube to a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf, add 30ul Nuclease-Free Water, incubate at RT for 1 minutes, then centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 1 minute.
9. Measure concentration, label the Eppendorf.
