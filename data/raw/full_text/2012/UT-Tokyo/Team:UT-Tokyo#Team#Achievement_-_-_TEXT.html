Achievement
We have produced hydrogen by fermentation.
We have demonstrated our biobrick parts contribute to hydrogen production.
We have shown possibility to improve the Biobrick system for following reasons:
We have suggested a possible alternative method of "knockdown" in E. coli.
We have assessed and improved existing parts, especially Arg box.
We have made a conclusion that reading is still a powerful source of information.
We have introduced more than 70 books in order to improve science literacy.
We have had a nice time communicating with various people in the May Fes!
We have enjoyed this summer!!!
