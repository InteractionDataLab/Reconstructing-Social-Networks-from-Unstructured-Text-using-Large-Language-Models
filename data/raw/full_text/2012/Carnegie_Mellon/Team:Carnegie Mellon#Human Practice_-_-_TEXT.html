Human Practices
Overview
This year, we spoke to high school students on several occasions about synthetic biology, iGEM and our project. Jesse Salazar designed an electrical analog of the characterization method we developed so that high school students could interactively learn about promoters and gene structure. Here, the schematics of the construct are displayed and a detailed description of the system and how to use it are displayed. This is designed to be a cheap, open source tool so that virtually anyone can build it and run simulations using our model. Our mathematical model is also programmed into the software so that given experimental values, one will obtain true output parameters.
