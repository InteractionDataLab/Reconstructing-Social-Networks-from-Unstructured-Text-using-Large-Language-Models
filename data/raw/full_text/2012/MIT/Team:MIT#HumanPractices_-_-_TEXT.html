Community Outreach
HSSP Class
We are passionate about sharing the exciting advances in research in the field of synthetic biology with young minds! On August 12, 2012, we taught a course on Synthetic Biology to local Boston middle-school students through the MIT Educational Studies Program. Our fun course included introducing the central dogma and basic molecular biology background information, teaching about cool circuit parts and simple molecular biology design tools, and interesting new applications of the research. Through our engaging course, we hope to have inspired these young minds to learn more about the field and to join us as members of the synthetic biology community some day!
Splash! Class
On November 17, 2012, we plan on teaching a course about Synthetic Biology to Cambridge and Boston high-school students. We hope to make a difference in the lives of a few future biologists by introducing them to tools, techniques, and exciting applications from the cutting edge of synthetic biology. Since this is for high-school students, we will be able to cover more difficult material. We're looking forward to it!
International Outreach Projects
Internationalization Project of Synthetic Biology
Our team has laid the foundations of the Internationalization Project of Synthetic Biology (IPSB), a collaborative project between MIT and Tel-Aviv University (TAU) that aims to introduce synthetic biology to Palestinian and Israeli high school students. The project seeks to educate these students in basic synthetic biology, bioengineering, and bio-entrepreneurship principles in a combined, collaborative setting. Over the course of three years, the students would work together to develop a technical project to present in the iGEM High School Contest, as well as a business plan to commercialize their proposed project to present in the iGEM Entrepreneurial Contest. The program would allow veteran MIT iGEM students to instruct the students in Tel-Aviv over the summers, and would have TAU instructors lead supervision during the academic year. The pilot program is proposed to run from (June 2013-June 2014), with the intent of creating a Palestinian-Israeli iGEM college-division team as well in the future.
IAP Synthetic Biology Class
Last January, students from the 2011 MIT iGEM team ran an introductory synthetic biology class to recruit students for this year's program and to spread interest in the subject.  The class was offered during MIT's storied Independent Activities Period (IAP), a four-week gap period in MIT's academic calendar.  Over two weeks, students learned biological theory and basic lab techniques, and built an inducible luciferase circuit.  Several students in the class ended up joining the 2012 iGEM team.  We plan to offer this class again next year and are currently designing the curriculum.

NEGEM
We participated in the first New England Regional iGEM (NEGEM) meeting at Boston University! Hosted by the BU team on September 15, 2012, the NEGEM meeting allowed four local iGEM teams – Boston University, Wellesley, Brown-Stanford, and MIT – to practice presenting our respective projects in front of an audience. Each team received valuable anonymous feedback about their project and viewed presentations from members of the other three teams. We really appreciate the opportunity to have been a part of this collaborative experience!

Collaboration with Fellow iGEM Teams
Wellesley
We collaborated with the Wellesley HCI team as beta-testers of their software! Check out their wiki .  We got to play with Wellesley's touch screen MoClo planner software, on a large PixelSense-style screen (a.k.a. the old, pre-tablet Microsoft Surface).  MoClo planner makes the plasmid-building process easier by integrating research tools, computer aided design, and construction planning under one application.  Having experienced plasmid construction firsthand this summer, the MIT iGEM team wholeheartedly supports any efforts to make the task simpler.

Several members of our team also tested SynBio Search , Wellesley's semantic search website for synthetic biologists.
In addition to testing their software, we also helped the Wellesley team by hosting Wellesley observers in our team meetings.  Through observing our team in action, the Wellesley team improved their understanding of what sorts of tools synthetic biologists need, and what challenges they face that can be solved by software.
TU Munich
Our team also participated in a survey run by TU Munich and received a collaboration medal from their team (shown below). Check out their wiki .
Overview
As representatives of the iGEM and synthetic biology communities, our team aims to serve as a positive influence locally and globally. We recognize significant broad impacts of our 2012 iGEM research project, both for fundamental advances in synthetic biology research and also for potential therapeutic applications stemming from our novel technology. Furthermore, we aim to promote a wider understanding of the synthetic biology field within the local and global communities and have organized several outreach and educational programs to accomplish this goal. Finally, we understand the importance of collaboration within the scientific community as a means of progress and have thus worked closely with fellow iGEM teams to foster positive connections and provide valuable assistance on their research projects.
To promote understanding of synthetic biology, as a team we taught our favorite topics in synthetic biology to middle and high school students in the Boston area this year. We formulated plans for international iGEM outreach in Tel Aviv, and we are designing a course on synthetic biology lab techniques to teach at MIT in January. Lastly, we participated in a New England regional iGEM meet-up (NEGEM) with the Boston University, Wellesley and Stanford-Brown iGEM teams and have formally collaborated with fellow iGEM teams by testing their software.
