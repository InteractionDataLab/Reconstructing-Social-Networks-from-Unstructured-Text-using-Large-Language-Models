Our instructors and other individuals from outside the Weiss lab provided the training necessary for us to conduct our work. Deepak Mishra, one of our advisors, taught cloning techniques and fluorescence microscopy on the Zeiss scope, assisted with FACS training, and operated the confocal microscope. Jonathan Babb, also an advisor, helped teach cloning techniques and assisted the team with the liquid handling robot. Initial tissue culture training was conducted by Kenneth Hu, a member of the 2011 MIT iGEM team. FACS training was also conducted by Glenn Paradis, manager of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research Flow Cytometry Core Facility. We were lucky to have Lulu Qian, whose work inspired our project, advise our team. Her feedback on design strategies and technical details for our project was invaluable. We would also like to thank the 2011 MIT iGEM team for providing our wiki design.  Without all of these contributions, our work this summer would not have been possible.
Otherwise, all of the data presented on the results page was generated by members of the 2012 MIT iGEM team, with the exception of some microscopy, time-lapse images in particular.
