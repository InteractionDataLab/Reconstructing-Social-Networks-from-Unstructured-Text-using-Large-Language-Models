Initially some trials of shaking flask cultivations were made with different parameters to identify the best conditions for the production of the His-tagged laccase LttH from <A href="http://www.dsmz.de/catalogues/details/culture/DSM-7039.html?tx_dsmzreso" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><I>Thermus thermophilus</I> HB27</A> named TTHL. Due to the absence of enzyme activity of the enzyme in the cell lysate a purification method was established (using Ni-NTA-His tag resin). Using <I>E. coli</I> KRX containing BioBrick &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K863010&lt;/partinfo&gt;, TTHL could not be detected by SDS-PAGE (molecular weight of 53 kDa) or by activity test. Therefore a new BioBrick &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K863012&lt;/partinfo&gt; was constructed and expressed in <I>E. coli</I> Rosetta-Gami 2. With this expression system the TTHL could be detected by SDS-PAGE and purified by using a small scale Ni-NTA column. The fractionated samples were tested regarding their activity. TTHL was shown to oxidize ABTS. After measuring activity of TTHL a scale up of the fermentation was successfully implemented up to 6 L. A further scale up to 12 L with a optimized medium (HSG) and a labscale Ni-NTA-Purification were implemented to enable additional experiments to characterize TTHL. A total specific enzyme activity of 15 U mg<SUP>-1</SUP> was determined for TTHL at pH 4 at 25°C with ABTS as a substrate.

This time <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Protocols/Materials#HSG_Autoinduction_medium" class="external text" rel="nofollow">HSG autodinduction medium</A> was used to produce more biomass. Due to the change of media and to a low amount of cells for inocculation, there was a long lag phase of about 6 hours. During this phase the glycerin concentration is nearly constant. The cells were in an exponential phase between 8 and 18 hours of cultivation, which results in a decrease of gylcerin, of pO<SUB>2</SUB> value and therefore in an increase of agitation speed. After 18 hours of cultivation the maximal OD<SUB>600</SUB> of 9.63 was reached and the glycerin was completely consumed. At that time the cells were just entering the stationary phase. No further data for OD<SUB>600</SUB> were measured. The cells have been harvested after 22 hours of cultivation. In the review, to leave the cells longer in the stationary phase could have been a better procedure concerning the yield.

This strategy was chosen to improve the purification caused by a step by step increasing Ni-NTA-elution buffer concentration. The elution was collected in 10 mL fractions. In Figure 3 only the UV-detection signal of the wash step and the elution are shown, this is because of the high UV-detection signal of the loaded samples and to simplify the illustration of the detected product peak.

Contrary to our expectations, the chromatogram shows one distinguished peak.

Earlier measurements of other bacterial laccases showed that the elution of these laccases begins with a elution buffer concentration of 50 % equates to 250 mM imidazole. One explanation of this result could be a low concentration of the produced TTHL. Consequently all elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect TTHL. In the chromatogram no further peaks were detected. The following increasing UV detection signal by increasing concentration of the elution buffer results from the rising imidazole concentration of the Ni-NTA elution buffer. The corresponding SDS-PAGES are shown in Figure 5.

There was no activity measurable after cultivation and purification of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K863022" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K863022</A> under the control of a T7 promoter. Activity tests of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K863012" class="external text" rel="nofollow">TTHL</A> under a constitutive promoter did reveal TTHL laccases capable of oxidizing ABTS. Fractions 1 to 5 of the purification above were rebuffered with deionized H<SUB>2</SUB>O and incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl<SUB>2</SUB> for 2 hours. Activity measurements were performed using 140 µL sample, 0.1 mM ABTS and 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) to a final volume of 200 µL. The change in optical density at 420 nm was detected, reporting the oxidization of ABTS through laccases. Fractions 1 to 5 show activity (Figure 6). Fraction 2 seems to contain most of TTHL showing the highest activity compared to the other fractions: 40 % of the used ABTS has been oxidized after 2 hours. Based on these results protein concentrations have to be determined and the activity of the TTHL laccase can be characterized in further experiments including pH optimum and activity in regard of temperature shifts.

This is the result of activity measurements using Britton-Robinson buffer with differently adjusted pHs. TTHL laccase was re-buffered into H<SUB>2</SUB>O and incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl<SUB>2</SUB>. The range from pH 4 to pH 9 was tested under substrate saturation at 25 °C for 30 minutes. At pH 5 ABTS gets oxidized the fastest (see Fig. 10 and 11). At higher and lower pHs than pH 5, the activity of TTHL is decreased considerably. The resulting Units mg<SUP>-1</SUP> support the observed data (see Fig. 12). At pH 5 TTHL shows a specific enzyme activity of ~15 U mg<SUP>-1</SUP>. The higher the pH, the less U mg-1 can be calculated for TTHL. At pH 4 and 6 the activity is decreased to 42 % and at pH 7 even to 14 % in comparison to pH 5. But still TTHL is active at this pH allowing an application of this laccase in a waste water treatment plant where the average pH is a pH of 6.9. However, a combination with a more effective enzyme should be considered.

The negative control without TTHL laccase but 0.4 mM CuCl<SUB>2</SUB> at 10 °C and 25 °C show a negligible oxidation of ABTS. The low difference observed between the two samples is great news for the possible application in waste water treatment plants.
