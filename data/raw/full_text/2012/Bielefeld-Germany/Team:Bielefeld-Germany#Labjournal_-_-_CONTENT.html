In March the final 2012 iGEM Bielefeld team was formed of 15 students and weekly meetings began. Our team was established and it was time to find a suitable project.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Find_a_project">Find a project</SPAN></H2><P>The first weekly meeting were more like big group brainstorming and we discussed idea, which in some cases were totally different from each other. Everyone had to inform about ideas of others so that, in the end, we all could discuss together.
</P><P>First project ideas were:
</P><UL><LI> the detection of multiresistent pathogens
</LI><LI> communication between bacteria and fungi using quorum sensing
</LI><LI> a bacterial hand warmer
</LI><LI> a possibility to detect and destroy mold fungus
</LI><LI> something about spontaneous combustion of hay bale
</LI><LI> an enzyme dispenser
</LI></UL><P>For most of the ideas little information was available. For example spontaneous combustion of hay bales is probably a combination of the metabolisms of different microorganisms and fungus. After some reports in media and press about the environmental effects of steroid hormones, we decided to go for hormones. From the beginning our aim was not to detect but to degrade hormones. We found several possible ways for degradation as there are the hydrolysis of estradiol-derivates with sufatases and glucoronidases. But we thought the best way to degrade steroid hormones would be with the use of laccases. Laccases have the ability to radicalize aromatic rings and can therefore be used to degrade or polymerize a broad range of substances, such as steroid hormones, special insecticides, polycyclic aromatic carbohydrates and aromatic acids. In nature laccases are often used for degradation or polymerisation of lignin or pigments.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Molding_together_to_a_team">Molding together to a team</SPAN></H2><P>After we found our project idea we decided to have a get-to-know-weekend with some presentations about iGEM, important methods and ideas for human practices. We also held presentations about other possible iGEM projects to extend our horizon, as there were: <I>e.g.</I> RNA aptamers  and magnetotactic bacteria.
But the most important part of this weekend was the growing as a team. We realized that we all had one summer to work together, have fun together and most important to stand up together as a team.
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Find_the_right_one_for_the_right_job">Find the right one for the right job</SPAN></H2><P>Now it was time to organize the work and find a suitable task for everyone. In a developing team a lot of different jobs have to be done, <I>e.g.</I>:
</P><UL><LI> finding sponsors
</LI><LI> communication with the public
</LI><LI> human practices
</LI><LI> wiki- and homepage-design
</LI><LI> modelling
</LI><LI> a forum for exchange of information
</LI><LI> a joker, who entertains the team and lifts the mood
</LI></UL><P>And finally lab work began, feel free to follow us in our weekly labjournal and have a look how our labwork, results and of course problems and their solutions, evolved.

For the experimental part our general idea was to give them an understanding of principle methods in biotechnology / synthetic biology by using fluorescent proteins. We planned the following experiments:
</LI><LI> Plasmid isolation of RFP/GFP from a liquid culture.
</LI><LI> Transformation of a plasmid mixture consisting of two different fluorescent proteins (e.g. RFP and GFP) and different antibiotic resistances into <I>E. coli</I> KRX. It will be plated out on LB agar plates without antibiotics and on plates containing one of the two antibiotics, which are present on the plasmids. This way we can demonstrate the effect of antibiotics as selective pressure. 
</LI></UL></DD></DL><UL><LI><B>Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:</B></LI></UL><P align="justify"><UL><LI>Before our lab time started we sent requests for different plasmids with the desired laccase genes to working groups, which have already worked with laccases we are interested in. Sadly just one working group responded to us. We got answer for a vector with the laccase-ORF <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/194015788" class="external text" rel="nofollow">CotA</A> from <I>Bacillus pumilus ATCC7061</I> and an ampicillin resistance from the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, Laboratory for Biomaterials in Switzerland. They promised to send us the plasmid pBpL6. <A href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/9" class="external text" rel="nofollow">More information...</A> For an uniformly labeling we will further call this laccase BPUL. 
</LI><LI> In a <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21790191" class="external text" rel="nofollow">publication</A> we found a research group who worked with the laccase <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/21230052" class="external text" rel="nofollow">CopA</A> from <I>Xanthomonas pv. campestris</I> ATCC33913. Luckily the sequence of this laccase is the same in <I>Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris B100</I> which we got from a research group at our university. We will call this laccase XCCL in our wiki from now on. 
</LI><LI>We found a <A href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/x33205rp257397kr/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">publication</A> which described the laccase <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/85674340" class="external text" rel="nofollow">CueO</A> from <I>E. coli W3110</I>. After blasting this laccase we found out that <I>E. coli</I> BL21(DE3) has this laccase, too. We decided to isolate the laccase from <I>E. coli BL21(DE3)</I> because this strain is available in our lab. 
</LI><LI> We generated new competent <I>E.coli</I> KRX cells.
</LI><LI> For the extraction of genomic DNA we cultivated <I>Xanthomonas campestris B100</I> and <I>E. coli</I> BL21(DE3). The bacterial strains we got from a working group at our University. After cultivation we isolated the genomic DNA. The DNA was needed as template for PCRs to purify the wanted laccase ORFs. 
</LI><LI> Primer design for the isolation of laccases from genomic DNA of <I>Xanthomonas campestris</I> B100 and <I>E. coli</I> BL21(DE3) and from plasmid pBpL6 <I>Bacillus pumilus</I> ATCC7061.
</LI><LI> In a team meeting earlier in the project we decided that we want to express the laccases under control of an inducible T7 promoter so we can choose the time point of induction. Additionally we decided that we want to use a c-terminal His-tag. Therefore the forward primers were designed with T7 promoter, RBS and the first 20 bases of the wanted gene. The reverse primers were designed with the last 20 bases of the wanted gene without the stop codon, a His-Tag and two stop codons. <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Protocols#Primers" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Primers</A>: Xcc_LAC_FW_T7, Xcc_LAC_RV_HIS, E.coli_LAC_FW_T7, E.coli_LAC_RV_HIS, B.pumi_LAC_FW_T7 and B. pumi_LAC_RV_HIS

</LI><LI> After the vector with the laccase gene bpul from <I>Bacillus pumilus</I> arrived, we transformed it into the competent <I>E. coli</I> KRX to have a larger amount of vector. The protocol we used was as followed: 
</LI><LI> The electroporation setup: U = 2,5 kV, C = 25 ÂµF and R = 400 Î©
</LI><LI> Since we did not know the efficient of our competent KRX we used two different <I>E.coli</I> volumes for the transformation, 50 ÂµL and 100 ÂµL. We gave 50 ÂµL 10% glycerol to the reaction tubes with 1 ÂµL of the vector DNA (<I>Bacillus pumilus</I>). After the transformation we plated them into ampicillin plates.
</LI></UL><LI> PCR with the <I>Xanthomonas campestris</I> B100 and <I>E. coli</I> BL21(DE3) genomic DNA to isolate the laccases. Therefore we used the primers Xcc_LAC_FW_T7, Xcc_LAC_RV_HIS, E.coli_LAC_FW_T7 and E.coli_LAC_RV_HIS which are listed under Materials.

We decided to check the activity via a photometer. The one we may use here at the Cebitec is a Tecan Microplate reader. Check  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Protocols/Materials#Tecan_Infinite_Microplate_Reader" class="external text" rel="nofollow">protocols</A> for further information. If oxidized by laccase, ABTS can me measured at 420 nm. Also we found out that sodium acetate buffer (100 mM / pH 5) would give an optimal environment to our enzyme. So letÂ´s have a look at our protocol:
</LI><LI><SPAN style="text-decoration: underline;">Initial laccase activity test:</SPAN></LI><LI>100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0
</LI><LI>5 mM ABTS
</LI><LI>8 U laccase
</LI><LI>ad 200 ÂµL deionized H<SUB>2</SUB>0
</LI></UL><LI>Also we talked about further characterization after accomplishing the first experiments and confirming that the used concentrations are a good choice. We are planning to buy and characterize the laccase from <I>T.versicolor</I> (TVEL0), to have a comparison to our future recombinant laccases. That laccase we are going to analyze in sodium acetate buffers that are adjusted to pH 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. Further we are going to analyze the effect of different temperatures on the enzymes activity. For that we will first do some more research on the temperatures of the waste water in clarification plants here in Germany. Also we found out that an addition of copper does enhance the laccases activity, so we are going to do some measurements with copper concentrations from 0.1 mM to 0.5 mM in each sample. This seems like some great experiments for the start, so next we are going to order what we need to do the measurements.

We started with the following setup: 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5), 5 mM ABTS, 8 U TVEL0 laccase, ad 200 ÂµL with deionized water. Then we measured the absorption at 420 nm every 15 seconds over a time period of 2 minutes. Immediately our samples turned dark blue but unfortunately the changeover was out of range to be detected by Tecan. With this information we needed to reduce the laccase concentration to get measurable results. We have chosen to try another measurement with 0.1 U TVEL0 laccase and it worked! The result was a nice saturation curve but it reached a too high, because not good measurable, optimum within 1 minute (Fig. 1). To avoid the loss of important data in the beginning of the reaction and to reduce the saturation OD we decided to slow everything down by using less ABTS.

</LI><LI> After testing the <I>T. versicolor</I> laccase under conditions that are optimal (pH 5, 25Â°C ) according to the literature we now started further characterization under different pHs. We analyzed the laccases behavior when working in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 1, 3, 7 an 9. Result: We agree with the literature that pH 5 seems to make the laccase happy. Since not all waste waters (especially those here in Germany) are not as warm as 25Â°C we now wonder what our laccase might do when exposed to lower temperaturers. Stay tuned.

Our team is planning to visit a municipal sewage plant for getting some insights into the water conditions there, so we will for sure test other temperatures after having more information. LetÂ´s hope the water there is a little warmer since laccase does not seem to be totally satisfied at 4Â°C. I would not either.

</LI><LI> Sequencing of the pSB1C3 plasmid with bhal(T7)_His was ok. In conflict to our reference sequence there was a point mutation in the DNA sequence but this mutation doesnât lead to another amino acid. So..next BioBrick (&lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K863020&lt;/partinfo&gt;) is ready to use!
</LI><LI> The sequenced plasmid bpul(T7)_His showed again the same mutation in the laccase ORF compared to the reference sequence. We concluded that probably the PCR amplification caused the point mutation. So we did the digest  of bpul(T7)_His PCR products from a new PCR, ligated it in pSB1C3 backbone and transformed it in competent KRX cells. Additionally we did the digest tthl(T7)_His and the ligation in pSB1C3 backbone again.

</LI><LI> While using the lab journal more frequently there came up some questions. 
</LI><LI> How detailed do we plan to write our lab journal entries?
</LI><LI> Do we want to write in keywords or explain everything in full sentences?
</LI><LI> Do we want to note every little detail about every successful or unsuccessful experiment or just the main important aspect?
</LI><LI> We discussed, sighted some former iGEM team wikis and decided:
</LI><LI> each team is responsible for their own lab journal entries
</LI><LI> we divide our lab journal in weeks <SPAN style="text-decoration: underline;">and</SPAN> days to prevent it from looking too chaotic.
</LI><LI> the texts are supposed to state which team is writing, which experiment has been done and what the main aspects were. Also we will write about successful experiments, as well as problems and solutions we came up with. If possible links to protocols with further information shall be created.
</LI></UL><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Wednesday_June_20th">Wednesday June 20th</SPAN></H3><UL><LI><B>Team Site Directed Mutagenesis:</B></LI><LI> Imported sequences of most of the used bacterial Laccases into Clonemanager and analysed their restriction-sites:
</LI><LI> bhal has no illegal restriction-sites
</LI><LI> ecol has one <I>Ngo</I>MIV-restriction-site
</LI><LI> bpul has one <I>Xba</I>I-Restriction-site and one mutation two <I>Age</I>I- and two <I>Ngo</I>MIV-restriction-sites (Decided to delete the Freiburg-restriction-sites would take too much time)
</LI><LI> tthl has one <I>Pst</I>I-restriction-site and two <I>Ngo</I>MIV-restriction-sites (Decided to delete the Freiburg-restriction-sites would take too much time)
</LI><LI> xccl has two <I>Pst</I>I, one <I>Age</I>I and seven <I>Ngo</I>MIV-restriction-sites (Decided not to change the <I>Ngo</I>MIV-sites, since to mutate seven would take too much time)
</LI></UL><UL><LI><B>Team Modeling:</B></LI><LI> Finding out, that the &quot;normal&quot; Michaelis-Menten kinetic isn't the right kinetic to model our situation, because therefor you need a high and steady state concentration of the substrates. We have low concentrations and not really study state. We found a transformed equation.
</LI></UL><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Thursday_June_21st">Thursday June 21st</SPAN></H3><UL><LI><B>Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:</B></LI><LI> Plasmid isolation and control digest with <I>Not</I>I on tthl(T7)_His and luckily this time the bands were where they should be. Again and again we did transformation of ligation with bpul(T7)_His laccase in pSB1C3 backbone..all fingers are crossed that this time we have colonies with the correct plasmid.
</LI></UL><UL><LI><B>Team Activity Tests</B> and <B>Team Immobilization:</B></LI><LI> After all this characterizing we feel so much closer to our <I>T. versicolor</I> laccase that its about time to make some activity test under immobilized conditions. So now we are cooperating with Team Immobilization. We have thought about many ways how to immobilize the laccase and decided to give Silica Beads the first try. Check the Immobilization TeamÂ´s protocol for further information. Our main problem was how to measure the samples with all those beads in it. Tecan will probably be confused and give us some false values due to the beads that are disturbing its laser. So we need a way to get the beads out (and thus also stop the reaction) at a very precise point of time. Centrifugation wasnÂ´t an option because it would simply take too long and not stop the reaction exactly in the second we want. While checking the internet for solutions we found Multi-Well Membrane-Bottom Filter Plates. Those are supposed to work in a similar way then our regular plates which we used for the Tecan but furthermore those plates contain a membrane that sieve the liquids through the filter when centrifugated. Thus the beads are separated and the ABTS-Buffer solution can me analyzed at 420 nm for oxidized ABTS. The plates will need a while before they arrive here at the CeBiTec, so we decided to first find out what the optimal amount of beads is and whether the beads might also bind ABTS (see lab journal Team Immobilization).
</LI></UL><UL><LI><B>Team Immobilization:</B></LI><LI>So after a lot of reading and discussion, we decided to try immobilization using beads. Since silica beads were already available in our lab (from last yearâs team), we decided to give them a try. The first challenge was to find out a convenient ratio of beads/laccase. According to the protocol of last yearâs team, the ratio 1:1000 was used (1000mg beads/ 1 mg protein). Therefore we decided to try the ratios 1:500, 1:1000 and 1:1500. We prepared different buffers: <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Protocols/Immobilization" class="external text" rel="nofollow">HBSS buffer</A>, <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Protocols/Immobilization" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Recrystallization buffer</A> both of which were used with silica beads; in addition to <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Protocols/Immobilization" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Britton-Robinson Buffer</A>, which was mentioned in publications as the best buffer for laccase immobilization. Laccases from TVEL0 were incubated with silica beads and different buffers at room temperature for 4hours on a rotator. After that, we collected the supernatants and delivered them to the team âActivity testâ and waited for the good news.

</LI></UL><LI><B>Team Immobilization:</B></LI><LI>Unfortunately, the activity test results werenât promising. According to publications, immobilization via covalent binding is the most widely used method. Silica dioxide bead offer only an adsorption of laccases. Therefore, we decided to order CPC-(controlled pore carrier) silica beads, to which laccases covalently bind, especially that we found some papers with protocols and activity tests proving their efficiency.

</LI><LI> We like our new cooperation with Team Immobilization. The thing is, that they donÂ´t like our buffer. Sodium acetate (pH 5) seems perfect for activity tests but apparently not for immobilization. What they prefer is a Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5). To find out whether there is a difference between the two buffers that causes different activity habits of our laccase TVEL0, we setup comparable measurements with the two buffers and TVEL0. We concluded that the laccase in sodium acetate buffer shows a slower saturation but all in all both laccase samples reach the same maximum so that it is ok for us to use both buffer systems.

For design the primer taox1-phis4-f and taox1-phis4-r we used the DNA sequence from the BioBrick <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K563000" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_K563000</A>. But this part was designed on DNA from <I>Sacharomyces cereviceae</I>. So we thought that we can not use this DNA sequence in <I>Pichia pastoris</I>. Our concerns were that the promoter site could not be detected by the transcriptional regulatory machinery. We tried to identified the promoter region upstream the <I>his4</I> gene on the plasmid pPIC9K from Invitrogen. Some blasts later, we saw that the <I>his4</I> ORF from this plasmid is virtually the same as the CDS in <A href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/537483" class="external text" rel="nofollow">NCBI</A>. Therefore, to create primers we used the DNA sequence from the plasmid pPIC9K and used the genomic DNA from the wild type <I>P. pastoris</I> X-33 or PCR amplification. Thus the primers taox-his4-f, taox-his4-r and his4-3aox1-f02 were new designed and ordered.

</LI><LI> Settings: We used 300Â mL flasks without baffles, final volume: 60Â mL, <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Protocols/Materials#Autoinduction_medium" class="external text" rel="nofollow">autoinduction medium</A>, 30/37Â Â°C, durance: 24Â hours 
</LI></UL><LI> Found out that we had a mixed culture of <I>E.Â coli</I> KRX with <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Labjournal/week1#Monday_April_30th" class="external text" rel="nofollow">pBpL6</A>, because it grew on chloramphenicol, but has only an ampicilline resistance. So we could not use this culture.

Therefore, we run a temperature gradient from 50 Â°C until 67 Â°C with the usual protocol for Phusion DNA polymerase. But no specific product could be detected.
</LI><LI>Because there were also many problems to get a PCR fragment of the HIS4 fragment for the shuttle vector we run a temperature gradient from 55 Â°C until 60 Â°C with the usual Phusion DNA polymerase protocol. From 50 Â°C until 65 Â°C we could detect the right fragment. The highest yield was at 60 Â°C.

We tested the cell extract for laccase activity by filling each well with 140 ÂµL cell extract, 40 ÂµL buffer, 18 ÂµL H<SUB>2</SUB>O and added 2 ÂµL ABTS. Unfortunately no activity was seen. We felt like we could not take the laziness of our laccases. We thought and discussed what the reason could be for them to be inactive.

Before translating the mRNA into cDNA we measured the following properties: 260/280: 1.93 and 260/230: 1.28. This indicates a high salt concentration which could be interfering during the PCR.

</LI></UL><LI><B>Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases</B>:
</LI><LI> After our laccases are not produced or not detectable we decided to try to express the laccases with a constitutive promoter. Therefore we searched for appropropriate promoters and found different promoters from the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Ribosome_Binding_Sites/Prokaryotic/Constitutive/Anderson" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Anderson promoter family</A>. We picked three different promoters with different promoter strengths. We chose the parts <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_J23103" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_J23103</A>, <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_J23103" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_J23110</A> and <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_J23103" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_J23117</A> and for all three promoters the RBS <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_J23103" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BBa_B0034</A>. The primers were designed that the FW and the RV primers anneal together to a short oligonucleotide with overhanging restriction site ends for <I>Eco</I>RI and <I>Spe</I>I. So we donât have to cut the annealed primers, because the sites should appear with correct annealing of FW and RV primers. The goal is to clone the different promoters, the PCR products with the different laccase genes with His-Tag in pSB1C3 in one ligation step. Furthermore we want to exclude the possibility that the His-tag is the reason for no activity, so we also want to clone the gene sequences without a His-tag under control of a constitutive promoter in pSB1C3. 
</LI><LI>Additionally we want to produce the constructs with a new T7 promoter. After our laccases were not expressed we now think that maybe the RBS &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_B0034&lt;/partinfo&gt;, which we changed in our primers from originally 5' aAagaggagaaa 3' to 5' aGagaggagaaa 3' is not or poorly recognized from the ribosomes in the cells.
</LI><LI>We have a primer pair from last year with the T7 promoter sequence with the RBS BBa_B0034. The primers can be annealed to an oligonucleotide. After boiling the primers and cooling down there should be an oligonucleotide with an <I>Eco</I>RI and a <I>Pst</I>I restriction site. We now want to assemble the promoter the laccase genes and the pSB1C3 vector in one step. The pSB1C3 backbone was digested with <I>Eco</I>RI and <I>Pst</I>I, the laccases with <I>Xba</I>I and <I>Pst</I>I, and the promoter has the restriction sites <I>Spe</I>I and <I>Eco</I>RI (we have to digest the promoter with <I>Spe</I>I, because the original restriction site is <I>Pst</I>I).

</LI><LI><B>Team Activity Tests</B>: Today was an exciting day for us. We got samples from Team Immobilization for activity measurements. They were trying to analyze which concentration of beads is a good choice for immobilizing the laccases. The exciting part was to check all the solvents they are using for possible reaction with ABTS during measurements. Check Team ImmobilizationÂ´s Labjournal and <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Protocols" class="external text" rel="nofollow">protocols</A> for the output and further information.
</LI><LI><B>Team Immobilization:</B></LI><LI>The 18h samples (see above: Monday August 6th/Team Immobilization and Tuesday August 7th/Team Immobilization) were washed with Britton-Robinson Buffer (link), then with 0.5M NaCl solution and again twice with the buffer.  The 36h samples were treated similarly as the 18h samples (see above: Tuesday August 7th/Team Immobilization). The supernatants were delivered to the âActivity Testâ team to measure the activity of the non-bound laccases. Based on the results, we would be able to figure out the most convenient bead concentration and incubation period. After comparing the results, we found out that the activity of the supernatant after 36h was less than after 18h, which indicated that 36h incubation is more convenient. On the other hand, the activity also decreased upon increasing the beadsâ concentration without reaching a saturation level (see Fig.). Therefore, we decided to carry out another experiment with higher beads concentration.

</LI><LI><B>Team Activity Tests</B>: 
</LI><LI> Again our skills in measuring laccase activity were in demand today. We had a job incoming from Team Substrate Analytic. Since they need to dissolve their substrates in methanol or acetonitrile, they were curious about laccase activity related to these solvents. And they infected us with their curiosity! So we started measurements using 0.1 U TVEL0 Laccase, 40 ÂµL sodium acetate buffer and different amounts of MeOH or acetonitrile respectively, ad 200 ÂµL H<SUB>2</SUB>O. Our tested range went from 2 ÂµL to 18 ÂµL. The results show that MeOH and acetonitril have an impact on the ability of TVEL0 to oxidize ABTS. Using 16 ÂµL MeOH (which means 8% of the amount of the sample contained MeOH) led to a different saturation curve as usual. The saturation couldn't be reached any more (see Fig. 1). Acetonitrile had a noticeable impact when using 5% (14 ÂµL) of it in relation to the sample (see Fig. 2). But in the end both solvents couldn't stop TVEL0 laccase from being active. We are happy to tell Team Substrate Analytics that they can proceed as planned and dissolve the substrates in the tested solvents.

</LI></UL></DD></DL><UL><LI><B>Team Cloning of Bacterial Laccases:</B></LI><LI> Colony PCRs: some prefix insertions of promoters in pSB1C3 with ecol and ecol_HIS showed positive bands, so we picked the colonies for plasmid isolation. The problem with the prefix insertion of the promoters in pSB1C3 with the ecol gene is that we canât easily prove that the promoters were ligated in the backbone because with control restriction there would be an about 50 bp longer fragment which is difficult to see even in 3Â % agarose gel. For this reason we designed FW primers (J23103_K_FW and J23110/117_K_FW and T7_K_FW) for our colony PCR, which can just bind, if the new promoter sequence is included in the plasmid. Until all colonies from the promoter J23110 ligation were red, we had some white colonies for the pT7 promoter in pSB1C3 backbone. So we picked a positive colony and plated it for plasmid isolation.
</LI><LI> We plated colonies on new plates, which weren't red from the transformation of pSB1C3 + pT7. We can't do colony PCR on this plasmids, because the resulting parts would be smaller than 100 bps.

</LI><LI> There have been some discussions about the storage of our laccases. It was said that the freezing of laccase (once deluted) might cause increased enzymatic activity. To find out whether storing the enzymes in the refrigerator or in the freezer is a better choice we compared to different samples from TVEL0. One was stored cooled and one was frozen and then measured as usual. As shown in figure 1 the frozen laccases showed an increased saturation curve and also reached the saturation slower. This seems like a clear hint to better store our enzymes in the refrigerator.

</LI><LI> Cells from today's cultivation were disrupted via sonication and laccase was purified by using the HisTrap column. This time the column was better cleaned by using the twofold volume of 500Â mM imidazol.
</LI><LI><B>Team Activity Tests:</B></LI><LI> Today we received even more samples from Team Cultivation. The interesting fact about those samples is that the cells that produced those laccases have been cultivated with CuCl<SUB>2</SUB>. We compared different measurements setup to see what the influences of different environments on the laccase can cause regarding enzyme activity.

Figure 2 shows the laccase activity in H<SUB>2</SUB>O without previous CuCl<SUB>2</SUB> incubation. In both cases the enzyme activity is comparable. This letÂ´s us conclude that their is no distinct difference between adding CuCl<SUB>2</SUB> during cultivation of before activity measurements. Figure 3 and 4 show the results of the same laccase that have not been rebuffered in H<SUB>2</SUB>O but measured in an imidazole buffer that is used during purification.

</LI></UL><UL><LI><B>Team Activity Tests:</B></LI><LI> This week we had Team Modeling over and they told us about their concerns. To continue modeling they wanted to have a look at the activity of our laccase from <I>T. versicolor</I> but with different ABTS concentrations. Especially the were interested in the first time points after adding ABTS. This should give them enough information to calculate the enzyme activity. We didn't want to wait, so we started immediately with our standard activity test. Our tested ABTS concentrations were: 0.5Âµl, 1Âµl, 2Âµl, 4Âµl and 8Âµl. We got nice activity curves but also noticed, that the activity saturated quickly and therefore the initial activity of our laccase can not be measured accurately. Of course Team Modeling got our data just in time, but we also want to start new activity tests with half of the amount of laccase. So we are still trying to keep our lovely Team Modeling satisfied.

</LI><LI> We got another <I>E.coli</I> strain (Rosetta-gami 2) from our supervisor Dr. Christian RÃ¼ckert. The cells carry a chloramphenicol-resistant plasmid, pRARE2, which supplies tRNAs for seven rare codons, AUA, AGG, AGA, CUA, CCC, GGA and CGG under the control of their native promoter. We want to use this strain for the expression of TTHL and BHAL hopeful that some rare codons are the reason that the laccases canât be expressed by now. So we need the genes under control of a constitutive promoter because this strain has no T7 polymerase and we canât use our inducible constructs. Further the plasmids need to have AMP resistance, because otherwise we can't select on positive transformed cells. Hopefully the plasmids, we sent for sequencing are ok, so we can use them.

After fermentation and Ni NTA purification the laccase was still hanging around in imidazole buffer, so we rebuffered it into nanopure water. We incubated the sample with copper and considered to measure the protein concentration before running the activity tests. Using the protocol for determining the protein concentration via Bradford (standards were 1 mg/ml, 1.5 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml BSA) we got a final <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K863000/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BPUL</A> laccase concentration of 0.22 mg/ml. With this information we designed the following activity test different as usual. As a positive control we took 140 Âµl of our bought laccase TVEL0 with a concentration of 0,021 mg/ml. Accordingly to this concentration we applied 14 Âµl of the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K863000/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BPUL</A> laccase to get approximately the same amount of laccase into each well. Additionally we tested 140 Âµl of the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_K863000/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BPUL</A> laccase to make sure that we will definitely see any activity. After measuring the samples the whole night we got our results in the morning. It turned out, that our store bought laccase TVEL0 was rapidly active as seen before in our activity tests.

We got some new and nice fractions that we tested immediately after rebuffering in H<SUB>2</SUB>O, determining and adjusting the protein concentration via Bradford and incubating with 0.4 mM CuCl<SUB>2</SUB>. The samples we got were large tubes so that this measurement was decisive for further characterization of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K863005" class="external text" rel="nofollow">ECOL</A>. Fraction 7 was our favorite (it convinced us with its high protein concentration and great enzyme activity) so that we chose that one to be our candidate for all future measurements with <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K863005" class="external text" rel="nofollow">ECOL</A> (see Figure 3)

We realized that our primers we used for amplification of the laccase genes for cloning in the shuttle vector don't have overhanging ends which were needed for an optimal activity of the enzyme <I>Aar</I>I. So we had to order new primers with some bases prior to the recognition sites. But after there is little time left until wiki freeze and the new primers need some time until they are here we started a last trial for cloning this 'wrong' PCR products in the shuttle vector. The idea was to phosphorylate and ligate the ends of the PCR product from tvel5 together. Then the problem with the missing bases at the end would be solved and <I>Aar</I>I can digest the end of the PCR product. We digested the shuttle vector with <I>Aar</I>I and dephosphorylated it. After ligation we transformed the approaches in <I>E. coli</I> KRX cells.
</LI><LI> The ligation of the parts in pSB1C3 was not successful. So the Parts and the plasmid have to be digested with <I>EcoR</I>I and <I>Spe</I>I restriction enzymes.
</LI></UL><UL><LI><B>Team Cellulose Binding Domain:</B></LI><LI> Designed a lot of primers to cope with the expression problem. E.g. inserting a long S3N10-Linker via blunt-end-cloning between the CBD and the GFP, also primers to get rid of the His-tag on the GFP and a last set to easily change the order of CBD and GFP (via assembly but with no linker in between).

</LI></UL><LI><B>Team Activity Tests:</B></LI><LI> Another day full of measurements is over! Today we measured some more samples from Team Immobilization: check their labjournal. As well we went on with characterizing our laccases. <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K863005" class="external text" rel="nofollow">ECOL</A> was analyzed regarding its behavior in different concentrations of MeOH and acetonitrile. The activity was measured with concentrations of 2-16 ÂµL, respectively. Since ABTS is changing itÂ´s emission spectrum when being in contact with methanol we also detected the OD<SUB>530</SUB>. As expected ECOL is happier when only little MeOH is in its environment. We did the same measurements with acetonitrile and got the same result: the fewer acetonitrile, the better for ECOL. Again, we will hand over these results to Team Substrate Analytics.

Through our cooperation with the clarification plant we found out that the waster water here in Germany has a minimal temperature of 10Â°C throughout the year. We used this value together with our previous measurements at 25Â°C to complete the temperature gradient of our measurements. Eventhough <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K863005" class="external text" rel="nofollow">ECOL</A>  shows an increased activity at 10Â°C, it does reach a comparable OD value as the samples measured at 25Â°C. The increased activity is expressed by achieving the maximal OD<SUB>420</SUB> slower than the laccase measured at 25Â°C. This seems like good news for Team Modeling. On the other hand <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K863000" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BPUL</A> shows nearly the same great activity at 10Â°C as at 25Â°C.

We agreed, that the most active fraction contains 90Â % laccase, which is commonly used in the literature. Since we applied the same protein amount of each fraction for the activity measurements, we made sure that the results really correspond to the amount of laccase. These are the most active fractions we have chosen with their contained laccase amount:
</LI><LI> ECOL: Fraction 50% 2 with a laccase concentration of 63,9 Âµg mL<SUP>-1</SUP>.
</LI><LI> BPUL: Fraction 50% 2 with a laccase concentration of 25,1 Âµg mL<SUP>-1</SUP>.
</LI><LI> BHAL: Fraction  5% 3 with a laccase concentration of 10,9 Âµg mL<SUP>-1</SUP>.
</LI><LI> TTHL: The best fraction of our TTHL laccase was fraction 50% 1 with a laccase concentration of 4,03 Âµg mL<SUP>-1</SUP>. In regard to Team Immobilization and Team Substrate Analysis we had to reach a higher amount of TTHL laccase. So we thought of combining two fractions. We chose the second best fraction of TTHL, which is 5% 3. To calculate the amount of contained laccase we had to compare the activity and reconsidered the slope. Since we stated the fraction with its highest activity as 90Â % contained laccase, we calculated the amount of laccase regarding to that one. The following figure shows the slopes we got out of the activity from fraction 50% 1 and fraction 5% 3 (which is the second best). Accordingly to this, fraction 5% 3 contains 68,9% of laccase, which is 4,8 Âµg mL<SUP>-1</SUP>. In total, the composed fraction contains 4,4 Âµg mL<SUP>-1</SUP>.

One remark was about the calculation of the enzyme specific units. As you all remember, we measured the activty with 0.1 mM ABTS, but to get comparable results with the literature, we had to measure each protein with other concentrations of ABTS. The concentration of ABTS should be saturated for each laccase. So we started with ECOL and BPUL and applied different ABTS concentrations starting from 0.1 mM as usual: 0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM and 5 mM. We applied 616 ng Laccase in each sample. Our results showed, that especially ECOL does not reach its substrate saturation with 5 mM ABTS. Our plans are now to check these concentrations of ABTS for BPUL and TTHL and also higher concentrations of ABTS for all laccases. For that we should reduce the enzyme amount to be able to detect the change in OD 420 properly.
