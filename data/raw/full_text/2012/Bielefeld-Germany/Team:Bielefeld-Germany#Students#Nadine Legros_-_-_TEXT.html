Studies: Molecular Biotechnology, because of it's interdisciplinary. I wanted to study something with both biology, excessively genetics and chemistry and I'm also interested in informatics and physics.
The reason why I participate in iGEM: I love the possibility to plan and operate our own project. To get in contact with other international teams and to work for our selves. I wish to learn something about organising new projects and about interacting in a team, in which everyone has the same goal. I want to use iGEM to improve my soft skills and to learn new interesting methods.
Things I which during working in Lab: Great results of course. And fun, even if something does not work... we'll find a way.
What I do if I'm not in Lab: Sports, I like do go mountain-biking, swimming, doing archery, or just running trough nature, if I can find some time between lab, working an learning. I also would like to paint a picture again, but this will have to wait.
My favorite laboratory equipment: UV-table it's making things glow
My favorite Protein: GFP, RFP and everything colourful.
And my favorite organism: Hansenula polymorpha – it hates me, but I love it anyway.
What I think about safety an how I want to practice it: It's quite important and everybody should know what she or he's doing when working in a laboratory.
Time I like most to work: (early bird/ not a morning person) If I'm abele to get enough sleep definitely someone who likes to work early in the morning. The Lab is quite nice when everybody is still sleeping.
