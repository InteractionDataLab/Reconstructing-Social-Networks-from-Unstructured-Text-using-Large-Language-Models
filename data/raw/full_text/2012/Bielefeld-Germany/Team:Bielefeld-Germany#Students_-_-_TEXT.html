Our Team consists of 15 dedicated undergraduate students from Bielefeld University. We are majoring in Molecular Biotechnology, Genome-Based Systems Biology, Bioinformatics and Molecular Cell Biology. Our participation in this competition enables us to get inolved in an international project, which gives us the chance to collaborate and challenge with excellent early stage researchers from all over the world. This participation results from personal and scientific interest and all our work is realized in our spare time besides the regular academic calendar. In order to realize our project, we try to maintain a high level of organization charge  and accomplish a large amount of work. But despite all the work, we have a lot of fun
