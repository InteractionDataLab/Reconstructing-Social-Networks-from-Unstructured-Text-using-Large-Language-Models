Project Achievements
We successfully produced, purified and identified active laccases of E. coli BL21(CueO named ECOL), Bacillus pumilus DSM 27 laccase (CotA named BPUL), Bacillus halodurans C-125 laccase (Lbh1 named BHAL) and Thermus thermophilus HB27 (tthL named TTHL).
Results ECOL
Results BPUL
Results TTHL
Results BHAL
We successfully designed a shuttle vector for site-directed integration in P. pastoris which allows the production and secretion of a protein of interest. We were able to show that the vector is functioning as expected.
Results
We successfully produced the laccase TVEL5 from Trametes versicolor in P. pastoris and showed the activity of the produced enzymes.
Results
We successfully characterized the activity of all four bacterial laccases produced regarding the oxidization of ABTS under different conditions.
Results ECOL
Results BPUL
Results TTHL
Results BHAL
We established a method for the degradation of several compounds with the help of our self-produced laccases. The HPLC analysis showed that our produced bacterial laccases are able to degrade estradiol with and without addition of ABTS. BPUL is able to degrade ethinyl estradiol with addition of ABTS. LC-MS measurements showed degradation products which could not be identified but were further analyzed using MS/MS. The resulting products have been discussed with an organic chemist.
Results
We successfully immobilized Trametes versicolor laccase (named TVEL0), E. coli BL21 laccase (CueO named ECOL) and Bacillus pumilus DSM 27 laccase (CotA named BPUL) and measured their activity.
Results TVEL0
Results ECOL, BPUL, BHAL and TTHL
We successfully created a model which simulates the required laccase amount to degrade harmful substances under real sewage plant conditions.
Results
We conducted a feasibility study of our project with sewage plant experts.
Results
We successfully created our own database to organize our samples.
Results
We successfully improved a BioBrick by clarifying its true function.
Results
We did an outstanding outreach work.
Results
We won a gold medal at the Europe Regional Jamboree.
We qualified for the world campionship

About our Wiki
Fifteen students from different fields of study from the Bielefeld University aspired to complete a project called TOXIC COMPOUNDS IN NATURAL WATER - A CASE FOR LACCASE. In his Wiki we document our achievements and our approach.
