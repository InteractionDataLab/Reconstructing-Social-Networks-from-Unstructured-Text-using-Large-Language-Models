How our project reaches the world
Internet Articles
After having chosen the degradation of estrogen derivates with laccases to be our iGEM project we published our first press release on the 25th of june in German als well as in English. In following weeks and months  a lot of newspapers, journals and online magazines reported on our project. We are very proud to have raised interest not only in Germany but in several other countries, too. Feel free to browse through the different articles, published online about our project and iGEM.

Radio and Television
We are honored to be part of a documentation about the newest developments in SynBio and iGEM, directed by John Kantara . In early October we had two shooting days with Mr. Kantara and his team. Not only did we have much fun but we are sure that the film will help to communicate SynBio and iGEM and thus to lower prejudices and anxiety of the broader public towards SynBio. Most probably the film of Mr. Kantara will be aired on 3sat, a German television company, on the 17th of January, 2013 at 20:15. We are really looking forward to this day.
We also had the chance to talk about our project and the problem of estrogen and other phenolic compounds in water in two radio broadcastings.

Print Articles
With our project we could not only raise interest of online magazines, German newspapers reported about our project as well. Especially the SynBioDay, which was held by nearly all German iGEM teams, attracted attention of the local media.
