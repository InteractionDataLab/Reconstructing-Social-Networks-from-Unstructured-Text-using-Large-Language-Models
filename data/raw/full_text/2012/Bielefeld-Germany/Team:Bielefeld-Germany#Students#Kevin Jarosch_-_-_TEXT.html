Studies: Molecular Biotechnology, because it's an interesting study program. May favorite themes in the studies are biochemistry, chemistry and fermentation, and this Study combines these themes in an interesting way.
The reason why I participate in iGEM: To work on our project, to improve my softskills and to get new connections to the scientific network. I hope to win the Main Award and the Improvement of my Skills.
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab: Every Experiment should work and generate the results we want to see.
What I do if I'm not in Lab: Speed-Cycling, swimming, fitness and playing guitar
My favourite  laboratory equipment: Tecan Pipetting Robot… does all the work by itself
My favorite Protein: GFP…… Everything is GREEN :-D
And my favourite organism: Penicillium chrysogenum….. this fungus saves the world
What I think about safety an how I want to practise it: It´s a very important topic. Everybody should think about the experiments he or she is doing, before he or she does something. First thinking than doing!!!!! Everybody is responsible for the Safety in the laboratory. This should be manifested in the brain of everybody.
Time I like most to work: (early bird/ not a morning person) I´m working the whole day (24/7)
