First some trials of shaking flask cultivations were made with various parameters to identify the best conditions for production of the His tagged laccase Lbh1 from <A href="http://www.dsmz.de/catalogues/details/culture/DSM-18197.html?tx_dsmzresources_pi5" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><I>Bacillus halodurans</I> C-125 </A> named BHAL. Due to inactivity of the enzyme in the cell lysate a purification method was established (using Ni-NTA-Histag resin). BHAL could not be detected by SDS-PAGE (theoretical molecular weight of 56 kDa) or activity test by using the BioBrick &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K863020&lt;/partinfo&gt; and <I>E. coli</I> KRX as expression system. Due to this results the new BioBrick &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K863022&lt;/partinfo&gt; was constructed and expressed <I>E. coli</I> Rossetta-Gami 2. With this expression system the laccase could be produced and analysed via SDS-PAGE. A small scale Ni-NTA-column was used to purify the laccase. The fractionated samples were tested regarding their activity with ABTS and showed ability in oxidizing ABTS. A scale up to 12 L with a optimized medium (HSG) and a labscale Ni-NTA-Purification were implemented to enable additional experiments to characterize BHAL. A total specific enzyme activity of 8 U mg<SUP>-1</SUP> was determined for BHAL at pH 4 at 25°C with ABTS as a substrate.

The varied parameters in our screening experiments were temperature (27 °C, 30 °C and 37 °C), concentration of chloramphenicol (20 - 170 µg mL<SUP>-1</SUP>), induction strategy (autoinduction and manual induction with 0,1 % rhamnose) and cultivation time (6 to 24 h).

For further cultivations <I>E. coli</I> Rosetta-Gami 2 was transformed with BBa_K863012, because of its ability to translate rare codons. Finally BHAL was produced under the following conditions:

Due to the change of media and to a low amount of cells for inoculation there was a long lag phase of nearly 10 hours. During this phase the glycerin concentration was approximately constant. The following cell growth caused a decrease of glycerin concentration and of pO<SUB>2</SUB>. After 11 hours the value fell below 50 %, so that the agitation speed increased automatically. After 21 hours the deceleration phase started and therefore the agitation speed decreased. The maximal OD<SUB>600</SUB> of 9.9 was reached after 22 hours, when the cells entered the stationary phase. The glycerin was completely consumed. The cells were harvested at this time. It might have been better to cultivate a few hours longer.

This strategy was chosen to improve the purification caused by a step by step increasing Ni-NTA-elution buffer concentration. The elution was collected in 10 mL fractions. In figure 3 only the UV-detection signal of the wash step and the elution are shown, this is because of the high UV-detection signal of the loaded samples and to simplify the illustration of the detected product peak.

The chromatogram of the BHAL elution is shown in Figure 3:

The chromatogram shows two distinguished peaks. The first peak was detected at a Ni-NTA-equilibration buffer concentration of 5 % (equates to 25 mM imidazol) and resulted from the elution of weakly bound proteins. Contrary to our expectations, the chromatogram shows the second distinguished peak. This peak was detected at a <A href="https://2012.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Protocols/Materials#Buffers_for_His-Tag_affinity_chromatography" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Ni-NTA-equilibration buffer</A> concentration of 100 % (equates to 500 mM imidazol) and resulted from the elution of bound protein. Earlier measurements of other bacterial laccases showed that the elution of these laccases begins with a elution buffer concentration of 50 %(equates to 250 mM imidazol). One explanation of this result could be a low concentration of the produced BHAL. Consequently all elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect BHAL. In the chromatogram no further peaks were detected. The following increasing UV detection signal by increasing concentration of the eltutionbuffer results from the rising imidazol concentration of the Ni-NTA elution buffer. The corresponding SDS-PAGES are shown in Figure 4.

This allows the comparison of Units mg<SUP>-1</SUP> with other laccase activities and data found in literature. For this purpose ABTS concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 8 mM were applied in an experimental setup containing Britton-Robinson buffer (pH) and a temperature of 25 °C. For measurements with 0.1 mM to 5 mM ABTS 616 ng BHAL were used (Fig. 7). For measurements with 5 mM to 8 mM ABTS only 308 ng BHAL were applied (Fig. 8). Applying less than 7 mM ABTS a static increase in oxidized ABTS was given. Measurements with 8 mM ABTS showed a slower increase in oxidized ABTS as with 7 mM ABTS (Fig. 8). This may be due to a substrate toxication. The most compromising ABTS concentration was 7 mM with the highest increase in oxidized ABTS. Therefore a substrate saturation was reached with 7 mM ABTS.

Using Britton-Robinson buffer pHs between pH 4 and pH 9 had been adjusted. 308 ng BHAL per well had been tested under these pH conditions using 7 mM ABTS. The CuCl<SUB>2</SUB> incubated and therefor activated BHAL showed a high activity at pH 4 and pH 5, where most of ABTS was oxidized (compared to Fig. 9 and 10). The calculated specific enzyme activity of BHAL showed high activity at both mentioned pHs (Fig. 11). While BHAL had an activity of ~8 U mg<SUP>-1</SUP> at pH 4 and pH 5, the enzyme activity decreased at higher pHs. At a pH of 6 only 1/3 of enzyme activity could be detected compared to the activity at pH 4 and pH 5. While still active at pH 7, the BHAL is not as suitable as thought for an application at a waste water treatment plant because of its high activity in acidic environments.

The measurements were conducted for 30 minutes. The obtained results revealed a lower activity of BHAL at 10 °C in comparison to 25 °C (see Fig. 12). The obtained results were used to calculate the specific enzyme activity which was at 4.2 and 7.2 U mg<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively (see Figure 13). The negative control without BHAL but 0.4 mM CuCl<SUB>2</SUB> at 10 °C and 25 °C showed a negligible oxidation of ABTS. The activity of BHAL was increased to about 60 % at 10 °C but nevertheless the observed activity at both conditions was great news for the possible application in waste water treatment plants.

The measurements were made to test if the produced laccases were able to degrade different hormones. Therefore the produced laccases were inserted in the same concentrations (3 µg mL<SUP>-1</SUP>) to the different measurement approaches.
