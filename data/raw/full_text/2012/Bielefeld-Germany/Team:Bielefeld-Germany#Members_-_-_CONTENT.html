Our Team consists of 15 dedicated undergraduate students from Bielefeld University. We are majoring in Molecular Biotechnology, Genome-Based Systems Biology, Bioinformatics, and Molecular Cell Biology. Our participation in this competition enables us to get involved in an international project, which gives us the chance to collaborate and challenge with excellent early stage researchers from all over the world. This participation results from personal and scientific interests and all our work is realized in our spare time besides the regular academic calendar. In order to realize our project, we try to maintain a high level of organization to accomplish a large amount of work. But despite all the work, we have a lot of fun.

Participating in iGEM offers the chance to plan and hold an own project. I would like to learn about communication with the industries as well as the broader public. Of course I also want to expand my laboratory skills and to deepen my scientific understanding.

It’s difficult to write about security in laboratories in a few sentences. I think it’s obvious that security is very important and everyone has to keep in mind that he is not only responsible for himself but also for all the other people. So it is necessary to follow all the rules in laboratories and to think about all risks of an experiment before starting it.

Lab safety is a very important topic. Everyone should be aware of safety when entering the lab and check for example if there is any food or water that should be left outside. Reading the safety instructions of chemicals and knowing how to dispose them properly are also basics. In my opinion one of the most significant aspects about lab safety is to leave the working area in a safe and tidy state.
