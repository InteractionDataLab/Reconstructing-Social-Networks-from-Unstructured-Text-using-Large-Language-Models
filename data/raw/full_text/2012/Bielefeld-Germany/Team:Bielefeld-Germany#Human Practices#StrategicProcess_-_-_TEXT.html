Meeting of iGEM teams from Germany
Robert and Gabriele beside our poster
On 28th of June 2012 the third yearly congress of the strategy process “ Biotechnologie 2020+ ” took place in Berlin. The strategy process was initiated by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research to gather ideas and information about new production processes and methods as well as new applications by supporting the cooperation of science and engineering. During the congress the recently realized achieved arrangements were presented and still existing problems and questions were discussed in workshops. Central aspects were inhibiting and supporting factors for the development and production of future biotechnology products.
This year all eleven iGEM teams from Germany participated with representatives at the congress of the strategy process. Each iGEM team was present with a poster about its project and the teams discussed their ideas with the participants of the

congress. For the iGEM teams the heterogeneous professions of the participants had the special advantage that their projects were observed from different points of view. To move closer together a get together with all iGEM teams took place with a lot of discussions, help offers and talk about collaborations. Especially for new teams this was a possibility to discuss not only problems concerning their project but also central questions of the competition and organizational concerns. One of the central topics of the meeting was Human Practices. In this connection the iGEM teams were considering about how it is possible to give the society a deeper understanding of synthetic biology. Therefore the final idea was to organize a common day of action in all ten cities of the iGEM teams to inform and to discuss with the public.
