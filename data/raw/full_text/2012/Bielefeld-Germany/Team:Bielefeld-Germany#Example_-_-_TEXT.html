Links
There are two important possibilities to include a link in your text. The first one is to refer to a wiki page, for example our home page. You can also refer to an external page. And there wouldn't be a better example than our german homepage . :)
Did we talk about pictures yet?
One of the most important things is to include pictures or diagrams. The first step is to uplade your picture. Use the "Upload" button at the bottom of each iGEM-page (remember: Uploading a picture is only possible if you are logged in). When uploading you have to make sure to have the appropriate rigths and to start the file name with Bielefeld2012_(and here comes the actual name). And now you decide how to arrange the picture and include it in the webpage:
Discodopsis likes the dance floor!
Some more facts to make your text even more prettier
Your text can be written in italics, bold (or both of it), underlined or striked. Also you can arrange your text
centered
left
or right.
There are a lot more stylistic goodies to arrange your text like this horizontal line above. If there is anything missing in this example page have a look at the MediaWiki help page or the german analog at Wikipedia . Have fun with creating and editing your own text :)
