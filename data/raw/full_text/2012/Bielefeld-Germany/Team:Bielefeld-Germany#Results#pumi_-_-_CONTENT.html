First some trials of shaking flask cultivations were made with different parameters to define the best conditions for production of the His tagged CotA from <A href="http://www.dsmz.de/catalogues/details/culture/DSM-27.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow"><I>Bacillus pumilus</I> DSM 27 ( ATCC7061)</A> named BPUL. Due to inactivity of the enzyme in the cell lysate a purification method was established (using Ni-NTA-Histag resin and Syringe or ÄKTA method). The purified BPUL could be detected by SDS-PAGE (molecular weight of 58.6 kDa) as well as by MALDI-TOF. To improve the purification strategies the length of the linear elution gradient was increased up to 200 mL . The fractionated samples were also tested concerning their activity and revealed high activity. Optimal conditions for activity were identified. After measuring activity of BPUL a successful scale up was made up to 3 L and also up to 6 L that enables an intense screening afterwards. A further scale up to 12 L with a optimized medium (HSG) was implemented to enable additional experiments to characterize BPUL. With this a total specific enzyme activity of ~40 U mg<SUP>-1</SUP> was determined for BPUL at pH 5 at 25°C with ABTS as a substrate. Additional scale up experiments will be important for further real world applications.

After 8.5 hours the deceleration phase started and therefore the agitation speed was decreased. The maximal OD<SUB>600</SUB> of 3.53 was reached after 10 hours, which means a decrease in comparison to the fermentation of <I>E. coli</I> KRX under the same conditions (OD<SUB>600,max</SUB> =4.86 after 8.5 hours, time shift due to long lag phase).

The chromatogram shows a remarkable widespread peak between the process volume of 460 mL to 480 mL with the highest UV-detection signal of 69 mAU, which can be explained by the elution of bound proteins. The corresponding fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis. During the elution, a steady increase of the UV-signal caused by the increasing imidazol concentration during the elution gradient. Between the process volume of 550 and 580 mL there are several peaks (up to a UV-detection-signal of 980 mAU) detectable. These results are caused by an accidental detachment in front of the UV-detector. Just to be on the safe side, the corresponding fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis.

The chromatogram shows a peak at the beginning of the elution. This can be explained by pressure fluctuations upon starting the elution procedure. In between the processing volumes of 832 mL and 900 mL there is remarkable widespread peak with a UV-detection signal of 115 mAU. This peak corresponds to an elution of bound proteins at a <A href="https://2012.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Protocols/Materials#Buffers_for_His-Tag_affinity_chromatography" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Ni-NTA elution buffer</A> concentration between 10 % and 20 % (equates to 50-100 mM imidazol). The corresponding fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The ensuing upwards trend of the UV-signal is caused by the increasing imidazol concentration during the elution gradient. Towards the end of the elution procedure there is a constant UV-detection signal, which shows, that most of the bound proteins was already eluted. Just to be on the safe side, all fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect BPUL. The SDS-PAGE is shown in Figure 6.

The reaction setup included 140 µL of a elution fraction, 0.1 mM ABTS and 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) to a final volume of 200 µL and the absorption was measured at 420 nm to detect oxidization over a time period of 5 hours at 25°C.

To determine at which pH the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K863000" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BPUL</A> laccase has its optimum in activity, a gradient of sodium acetate buffer pHs was prepared.

The results are shown in Figure 12. A distinct pH optimum can be seen at pH 5.

This fits the expectations as laccases are copper reliant enzymes and gain their activity through the incorporation of copper. Additionally negative controls were done using the tested concentrations of CuCl<SUB>2</SUB> without applying laccase to detect the oxidization of ABTS through copper (see Figure 15). The more CuCl<SUB>2</SUB> was present, the more ABTS was oxidzied after 5 hours. Still the maximal change accounts only for ~6% oxidized ABTS after 5 hours.

In order to find the substrate saturation, laccase activity was measured with ABTS concentrations ranging from 0.1 mM to 8 mM. 616 ng BPUL were used for measurements with ABTS concentrations of 0.1 mM to 5 mM, 308 ng BPUL were used for measurements with ABTS concentrations of 5 mM to 8 mM. Measurements were done in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) at 25 °C for 30 minutes taking the OD<SUB>420</SUB> every 5 minutes. Comparing the graphs in Figure 21 and Figure 22, both show a comprising substrate saturation with 5 mM ABTS. Higher concentrations of ABTS than 5 mM did not show any other effects on the activity of BPUL. For all following BPUL activity measurements after the Regional Jamborees in Amsterdam a concentration of 5 mM ABTS was applied.

This is the result of activity measurements using Britton-Robinson buffer with differently adjusted pHs. BPUL was re-buffered into H<SUB>2</SUB>O and incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl<SUB>2</SUB>. The range from pH 4 to pH 9 was tested under substrate saturation at 25 °C for 30 minutes. At pH 4 and pH 5 ABTS got oxidized the fastest (see Fig. 23 and Fig. 24). At higher pHs than pH 5, the activity of BPUL was decreased considerably. The resulting Units mg<SUP>-1</SUP> support the observed data (see Fig. 25). At pH 4 and pH 5 BPUL showed a specific enzyme activity of ~37 U mg<SUP>-1</SUP>. The higher the pH, the less U mg<SUP>-1</SUP> could be calculated for BPUL. At pH 7 1/3 of the activity decreased, but still BPUL was active at this pH allowing an application of this laccase in a waste water treatment plant where the average pH is a pH of 6.9.

The obtained results reveal a comparable activity of BPUL at high and low temperatures (see Fig. 26). The measurements were conducted for 30 minutes until saturation initiated. Both samples reached saturation after 15-20 minutes. The obtained results were used to calculate the specific enzyme activity which was in both cases at about 37 U mg<SUP>-1</SUP> (see Fig. 27). The negative control without BPUL laccase but 0.4 mM CuCl<SUB>2</SUB> at 10 °C and 25 °C show a negligible oxidation of ABTS.
