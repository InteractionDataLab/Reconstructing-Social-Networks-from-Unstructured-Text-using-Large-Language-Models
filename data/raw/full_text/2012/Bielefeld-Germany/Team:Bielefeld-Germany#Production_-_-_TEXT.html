Production Protocols: These are the protocols for the cultivation and the downstream processing.
Contents
1 Cultivation
1.1 Expression of Laccase genes in E. coli
1.2 Expression of Laccase genes in P. Pastoris
2 Purification methods
2.1 Enzymatic cell lysis with lysozyme
2.2 His-tag affinity chromatography
Cultivation
Expression of Laccase genes in E. coli
Chassis: Promega's E. coli KRX
Medium: LB medium supplemented with 20 mg L-1 chloramphenicol or autoinduction medium
Cultivations in LB-medium were supplemented with 0.1 % L-rhamnose as inducer, when the designated OD600 was reached.
Autoinduction medium for expressing was supplemented with 1 mM IPTG .
150 mL culture in 500 mL shaking flask with baffles (Schott) with silicon plugs
Cultivation temperature: 37 °C at 120 rpm
Expression of Laccase genes in P. Pastoris
Chassis: Pichia Pastoris
Medium:
200 mL culture in 1000 mL shaking flask with baffles (Schott) with silicon plugs
Cultivation temperature: 37 °C at 120 rpm
Purification methods
Enzymatic cell lysis with lysozyme
After cultivation biomass was collected by centrifugation at 5,000 g at 4 °C for 20 min.
1 g of biomass (wet weight) was suspended in 10 mL of enzyme buffer containing 0.1 % Triton X-100, 2 µL benzonase (250 U/µL) and 40 µL of lysozyme (100 mg mL-1)
Incubation for 30 min at 4 °C
reaction mixture was centrifuged for 30 - 90 min at 15,000 g at 4 °C
His-tag affinity chromatography
Column: 1 mL HisTrap FF crude by GE Healthcare
Harvest cells by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C
Discard the supernatant and freeze bacterial pellet at -20 °C for at least 30 min
Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL binding buffer for each gram of cell paste
Wash column with 5 - 10 mL of deionized water
Equilibrate column with 5 - 10 mL of binding buffer
For buffers see table buffers for his-tag affinity chromatography
Mechanical lysis:
Sonification on ice for 6 - 10 min with Sonifier 450 by Branson , max. 20 W, cooled on ice
Incubate lysate 1 h at 4 °C shaking or rotating for solving inclusion bodies
Centrifuge at 15,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C
Filter sample (sterile filter or 300 kDa cut-off)
ÄKTA method
Equilibrate with 20 column volumes binding buffer, 0.5 mL min-1
Load sample onto column
Wash with binding buffer until UV signal is constant
Elute with 50 mM imidazol
Elute remaining proteins with 500 mM imidazol
