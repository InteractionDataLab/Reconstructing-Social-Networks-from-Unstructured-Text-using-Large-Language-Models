Bioreactor cultivations with E. coli KRX
To obtain higher amounts and concentration of proteins we cultivated and expressed in a bioreactor. It is possible to cultivate several liters and to control temperature, pH and pO_2.
Bioreactor: Braun Biostat B Bioreactor (3L), Infors Labfors Bioreactor (3L), Bioengineering NLF22 Bioreactor (7 L),
Autoinduction-medium with 60 mg L-1 chloramphenicol

Airflow: 5 NL/min
pO2-Control: 30 % airsaturation (controlled with stirrer cascade starting with 200 rpm)
pO2=100% calibration with 300rpm
pH: 7.0 (controlled with 2M phosphoric acid and 2 M NaOH)
Antifoam: BASF pluronic PE-8100
Harvest after 12-13 h
Cell Harvesting
Harvest cells by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C
if the purification should start the next day store the cell pellet at 4°C !(the laccase must not be frozen!)
Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL special buffer or binding buffer for each gramm of cell paste
Solubilization of inclusion bodies
centrifugation of the celllysate at 40,000 g for 30 minutes
resuspend the pellet of the lysate in 1 mL 6M Urea solution, incubation for 1 hour
centrifugation for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm
resuspend the pellet in SDS running buffer
Cell disruption strategies
B-PER lysis (chemical lysis)
B-Per bacterial Protein Extraction Reagnt was used for a cell disruption screening according to the following protocol of Thermo Scientific.
add 4 mL B-Per Reagent per gram of cell pellet
resuspend the cell pellet by pipetting the suspension up and down until it is homogenous.
incubate the solution for 10- 15 min at room temperature
centrifuge lysate at 15.000g for 10 min
decant the supernatant in a clean tube
The lysate is ready for a following purification step.
enzymatical lysis with lysozym
The lysis with lysozym was used for a cell disruption screening. The following protocol was utilized:
resuspend the cell pellet in 600 µL of lysozym-solution per gramm
incubate the solution for 1 h at 4°C
centrifuge the lysate toseperate soluble proteins from insoluble proteins and cell debris.
combination of chemical and enzymatical lysis
B-Per bacterial Protein Extraction Reagnt was used for a cell disruption screening according to the following protocol of Thermo Scientific.
add 4 mL B-Per Reagent per gram of cell pellet
add 2µL of lysozym-solution(50 mg mL -1) and 2 µL DNaseI (2500 U mL -1) per  mL B-Per Reagent. (For laccases:Do not use EDTA!)
resuspend the cell pellet by pipetting the suspension up and down until it is homogenous.
incubate the solution for 10- 15 min at room temperature
centrifuge lysate at 15.000g for 10 min
decant the supernatant in a clean tube
The lysate is ready for a following purification step.
Mechanical lysis
The method of choice to disrupt the cells depends on the amount of biomass.
Mechanical lysis of the (shaking flask) cultivation
Sonication
Sonication of the re-suspended pellet on ice
cycle number depends on the volume of the resuspended cells (e.g. 3 mL means 3 cycles)
one cycle means sonification treatment for 1,5 min with Sonifier 450 by Branson, max. 50 %, cooled on ice, make sure not to heat the cells too much
Precellyse 24 homogenization
homogenization with the Precellyse 24
fill the precellyse tubes with a sample volume between 1 mL up to 1,5 mL (for 2 mL tubes)
homogenize the samples for 3 cycles (6500 rpm for 35 sec. ), to make sure not to heat the cells to much, the sample were stored for 5 min in ice between 2 cycles.
Mechanical lysis of the (bio-reactor) cultivation
Cell disruption with a high-pressure homogenizer
high-pressure homogenisation with a Rannie Homogenizer:
disruption of the cells by 3 cycles with cooling phases between the cycles, pressure = 1200 bar, make sure not to heat the cells too much
Purification
Ultra-/Diafiltration
Arrange the filtration module as shown on the right side.
Microfiltration (0.22 µm) or cross flow filtration with 300 kDa (we used a Milipore Pellicon XL 300) membrane of sample before ultrafiltration.
For concentrating the sample just filter it until the desired volume is left in the feed reservoir. For diafiltration (e.g. buffer exchange, desalting) dilute the feed reservoir several times and filter continously.
Used membranes: Milipore Pellicon XL 50 or XL 100 membranes
50 kDa cut-off
50 cm2 filtration area
tangential flow filter
Hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride membrane
Used pump: SciLog TANDEM 1081 peristaltic pump
flow rate during filtration: 40 mL min-1
