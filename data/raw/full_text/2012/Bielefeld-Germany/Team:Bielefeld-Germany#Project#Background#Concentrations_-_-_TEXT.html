Concentration data
This page gives a first impression for the concentrations of several human-derived substances in the european surface water. These data show that our water is contaminated with several micro-contaminants. Some of them are found in a terrifying concentrations in treated wastewater.
Micro-contaminants concentration of sewage effluent and surface water
These assay results were collected by the State Agency for Environment, Nature Conservation and Geology Mecklenburg-Vorpommern from 2008 to 2010. Measured data from watersamples of sewage treatment plants and surface waters are shown as part of a study ordered by the Federal Environment Agency (UBA-Germany).

Finding of a cooperating sewage treatment plan
These micro-contaminant concentrations were found in the clarified sewage water of the central sewage treatment plant of the city Schloß Holte-Stukenbrock (Germany) on 31.05.2012. The different micro-contaminants were detected by liquid chromatography-masspectrometry (LC-MS) or LC-MS/MS. For the original document click here .

About our Wiki
Fifteen students from different fields of study from the Bielefeld University aspired to complete a project called TOXIC COMPOUNDS IN NATURAL WATER - A CASE FOR LACCASE. In his Wiki we document our achievements and our approach.
