First some trials of shaking flask cultivations were made with changing parameters to identify the best conditions for 
the production of the laccase CueO from E. coli BL21 (DE3) named ECOL fused to a His tag. Because of no measured activity 
in the cell lysate a purification method was established (using Ni-NTA His tag resin and Syringe or ÄKTA method). The purified 
ECOL could be identified by SDS-PAGE (molecular weight of 53.4 kDa) as well as by MALDI-TOF. The fractionated samples were also 
tested concerning their activity. A maximal activity of 55% was reached, measured in ABTS<SUB>ox</SUB> [µM]. After measuring activity of ECOL a scale up was made up to 
3 L and then also up to 6 L that enables an intense screening afterwards. A further scale up to 12 L with a optimized medium was implemented to enable additional experiments to characterize ECOL. Additional scale up experiments will be important for further application. The enzyme was characterized further
regarding its temperature and pH optimum and concerning the influence of different concentrations of CuCl<SUB>2</SUB>, ABTS, MeOH and acetonitrile. A total specific enzyme activity of 5,5 U mg<SUP>-1</SUP> was determined for ECOL at pH 5 at 25°C with ABTS as a substrate.

After the positive measurement of activity of ECOL we made a scale-up and fermented <I>E. coli</I> KRX with &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K863005&lt;/partinfo&gt; in an Infors Labfors fermenter with a total volume of 3 L. Agitation speed, pO<SUB>2</SUB> and OD<SUB>600</SUB> were determined and illustrated in Figure 1. The exponential phase started after 1.5 hours of cultivation. The cell growth caused a decrease in pO<SUB>2</SUB>. After 2 hours of cultivation the agitation speed increased up to 629 rmp (5.9 hours) to hold the minimal pO<SUB>2</SUB> level of 50 %. Then, after 4 hours there was a break in cell growth due to induction of protein expression. The maximal OD<SUB>600</SUB> of 2.78 was reached after 5 hours. In comparison to <I>E. coli</I> KRX (OD<SUB>600,max</SUB> =4.86 after 8.5 hours) and to <I>E. coli</I> KRX with &lt;partinfo&gt;BBa_K863000&lt;/partinfo&gt; (OD<SUB>600,max</SUB> =3.53 after 10 hours, time shift due to long lag phase) the OD<SUB>600 max</SUB> is lower. In the following hours, the OD<SUB>600</SUB> and the agitation speed decreased and the pO<SUB>2</SUB> increased, which indicates the death phase of the cells. This is caused by the cell toxicity of ECOL (reference: <A href="http://www.dbu.de/OPAC/ab/DBU-Abschlussbericht-AZ-13191.pdf" class="external text" rel="nofollow">DBU final report</A>). Hence, cells were harvested after 12 hours.

The supernatant of the cell lysate was loaded on the Ni-NTA column (15 mL Ni-NTA resin) with a flow rate of 1 mL min<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. Then the column was washed with 10 column volumes (CV) <A href="https://2012.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Bielefeld-Germany/Protocols/Materials#Buffers_for_His-Tag_affinity_chromatography" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Ni-NTA equilibration buffer</A>.

This strategy was chosen to improve the purification caused by a step by step increasing Ni-NTA-elution buffer concentration. The elution was collected in 10 mL fractions. In Figure 2 only the UV-detection signal of the wash step and the elution are shown, this is because of the high UV-detection signal of the loaded samples and to simplify the illustration of the detected product peak. A typical chromatogram of purified laccases is illustrated <A href="https://static.igem.org/mediawiki/2012/4/49/Bielefeld2012_Chromatogram_examplegrafik.jpg" class="external text" rel="nofollow">here</A>.

After increasing the Ni-NTA elution buffer concentration to 50 % (equates to 250 mM imidazol), an UV-detection signal peak of 292 mAU was measured. The area of this peak indicates that a high amount of protein was eluted. The corresponding fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect ECOL. There were no further peaks detectable. The following increasing UV detection signal results from the rising imidazol concentration of the Ni-NTA elution buffer. The corresponding SDS-PAGES are shown in Figure 3.

Additionally negative controls were done using the tested concentrations of CuCl<SUB>2</SUB> but no laccase was added to detect the oxidization of ABTS through copper (see Figure 17).

The re-buffered fractions have been incubated with 0.4 mM CuCl<SUB>2</SUB> to gain higher activity of the laccases, because they are copper-dependent. Standard activity tests were done with all ECOL fractions with adjusted protein content for comparison. The experimental setup included the ECOL fractions, Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) and 0.1 mM ABTS. Measurements were done at 25 °C. Resulting, one fraction showed very high activity in comparison to the other fractions (see Fig. 22). This fraction, fraction 50% 2, oxidized up to 23 µM ABTS after 5 hours. The first number of the sample indicates the percentage of used elution buffer, whereas the second number stands for the fraction number of this elution. This fraction was set as containing 90 % ECOL laccase of the whole protein content. Therefore a ECOL concentration of 63,9 µg mL<SUP>-1</SUP> was gained.
