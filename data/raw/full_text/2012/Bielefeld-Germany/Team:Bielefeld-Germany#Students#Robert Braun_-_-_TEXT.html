Studies: Molecular Biotechnology, because it's an impressive and innovative combination of industrial production processes and research with a deeper understanding in molecular operations.
The reason why I participate in iGEM: Taking part in iGEM is maybe the best chance to test and surpass the own limits and to compete and cooperate with other young scientists. On of the greatest things about iGEM ist the “spirit”, the chance to meet and get to know hundreds of young people, feel and be part of the innovation of iGEM and to realize that all those people from around the world share the same passion. Participating in iGEM offers the chance to plan and hold an own project. I would like to learn about communication with the industries as well as the broader public. Of course I also want to expand my laboratory skills and to deepen my scientific understanding.
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab As many and as well as possible lab results and success in communicating our project and our result with the society.
What I do if I'm not in Lab: For me, the best way to enjoy the few hours of leasure time is sitting in the sun at the “Siegfriedplatz” in Bielefeld. Which, to be honest, is rarely the case. Either it rains (which is nearly always the case), or, well, it rains.
What I think about safety an how I want to practise it: Think before you act, so you can take the appriopriate steps to protect you, others and the environment. And always, always, always be careful when doing something stupid.
Time I like most to work: (early bird/ not a morning person)  The later the evening gets, the better the results. Nothing against the early bird, but I need my sleep.
