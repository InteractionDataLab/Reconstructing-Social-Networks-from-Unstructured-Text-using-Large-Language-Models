Studies: I study GBSB because i am fascinated about the genomresearch.
The reason why I participate in iGEM: iGEM Rockt :) and i wish to get to Boston
What I hope to achieve during working in Lab: That everything works in Lab.
My favourite  laboratory equipment: The pipette… You need it every time
My favourite Protein: GFP - It just amazing
And my favorite organism: E. coli’s easy to handle and it grows fast.
What I think about safety an how I want to practise it: The lab and person safety is important. The material you work could be replaced but the person not, so i care about my own safety while working at lab.
