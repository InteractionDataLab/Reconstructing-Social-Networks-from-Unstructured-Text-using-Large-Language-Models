Let´s give it up for our Laccase-donators
Arabidopsis thaliana
Picture of A. thaliana found at wikipedia.de
Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana), or commonly known as thale cress, is a small flowering plant which has been established as a model organism. We have chosen this little plant as a representative for higher eukaryotes and not only because there is a lot of research going on at Bielefeld University with this tiny little weed. A thaliana has a small genome with 125 Mb total and was sequenced completely in the year 2000. Besides the good annotation of genes there is also a large number of mutant lines available. The research on A. thaliana is progressing fast and researchers from all around the world are working with this model organism because of its rapid life cycle of 6 weeks and its easy cultivation even at restricted places, just to name a few examples. The Arabidopsis community is therefore huge and progress in understanding the cellular and molecular biology of this flowering plant is documented well and available. For our project we were interested in the laccase(s) of Arabidopsis. We did some research at TAIR and found 22 laccases or laccase-like genes. Stunned by the amount of laccase genes we decided to concentrate on just one which does not encode a laccase-like protein. We have chosen gene AT5G48100.1 and investigated further. Our next stop was at the eFP Browser to see where our chosen laccase is expressed. We found out, that it is expressed in the seeds and therefore available in the siliques, as you can see in here:
Laccase gene expression in A.thaliana seeds and siliques of different developmental stages. Expression is visualized in different red colors (see bar on the right).
With this bioinformatic research and the following laboratory work we try to get in contact with a laccase from a higher eukaryote.
