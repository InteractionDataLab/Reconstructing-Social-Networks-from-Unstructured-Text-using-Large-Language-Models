Laccases
Figure 1: The figure was designed with Jmol-software in combination with the data from the RCSB Protein Data Bank
The iGEM Team successfully produced four active bacterial laccases and an eukaryotic laccase (click for the results):
Escherichia coli laccase ECOL
Bacillus pumilus laccase BPUL
Bacillus halodurans laccase BHAL
Thermus thermophilus laccase TTHL
Trametes versicolor laccase TVEL5
Comparison of the different bacterial laccases
Purchased positive control Trametes versicolor laccase TVEL0
All four laccases (ECOL, BPUL, BHAL and TTHL) we accomplished to purify. Besides the successfully scale-up fermentation, those  laccases could be purified in a high amount to characterize the optimal activity conditions regarding  pH, temperature, buffer solutions  and  organic solvent resistance. Furthermore the iGEM Team Bielefeld demonstrated that the produced laccases can be immobilized maintaining their activity and the degradation capacity was screened for several micro-contaminants. These tests indicate that the ECOL and BPUL are able to degrade ethinyl estradiol and estradiol.

About our Wiki
Fifteen students from different fields of study from the Bielefeld University aspired to complete a project called TOXIC COMPOUNDS IN NATURAL WATER - A CASE FOR LACCASE. In his Wiki we document our achievements and our approach.
