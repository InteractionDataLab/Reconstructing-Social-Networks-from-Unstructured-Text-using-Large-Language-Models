Chemically competent cells
The transformation of E. coli with plasmid DNA via heatshock transformation requires chemically competent cells.
Materials
Equipment
-80°C freezer
Incubation shaker
Centrifuge (cooling cababilities required!)
photometer
Ice water bath
Chemicals & consumables
Ice and/or liquid nitrogen
Falcon tubes
dYT Medium (50 ml p.c.)
ice cold 100mM CaCl2
Procedure
Inoculate 2 mL of LB-Media with an E. coli colony and incubate at 37 °C overnight
Inoculate 200 mL LB with the preculture
Incubate at 37°C and 150 rpm until an OD600 of 0.4-0.6 is reached
Incubate cells on ice for 15 min
Centrifuge the culture at 4°C and 3000 x g for 10 min (the following steps are carried out on ice)
Resuspend cell pellet in 10mL ice cold 100 mM CaCl2 (Do not vortex!)
Incubate on ice for 1 hour
Centrifuge the culture at 4°C and 3000 x g for 10 min
Resuspend cell pellet in 10mL ice cold 100 mM CaCl2
Incubate on ice for 1 hour
Centrifuge the culture at 4°C and 3000 x g for 5 min
Resuspend cell pellet in 2mL ice cold 100 mM CaCl2 and 15 % (v/v) glycerine
Incubate on ice for 30 min
Aliquot the cells à 100µL
Store at -80°C
Solutions
CaCl2
5.55 g CaCl2
Add di H2O to 1 L
Sterilize by autoclaving
Cryo solution
0.278 g CaCl2
10 ml glycerin
Add di H2O to 50 ml
Sterilize by autoclave
