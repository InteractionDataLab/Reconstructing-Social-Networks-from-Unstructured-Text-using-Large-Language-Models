The SOB medium is used for growth of bacteria in preparation of chemically competent cells .
Ingredients
0.5% (w/v) yeast extract
2% (w/v) tryptone
10 mM NaCl
2.5 mM KCl
20 mM MgSO4
For 1 L:
0.186 g KCl
2.4 g MgSO4
0.584 g NaCl
20 g tryptone
5 g yeast extract
Adjust to pH 7.5 prior to use.  This requires approximately 5 mL of 5M NaOH per liter.
