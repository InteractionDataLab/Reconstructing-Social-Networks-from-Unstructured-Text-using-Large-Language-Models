Agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE)
Agarose gel electrophoresis is the most common used method to separate nucleic acids. Due to their negativ charge DNA and RNA molecules can be moved through an agarose gel by an electric field (electrophoresis). Longer molecules move slover through the agarose matrix while short move faster and migrate further.
Procedure
AGE is used for seperation of DNA fragment corresponding to their respective nucleotide lenght
The agarose gel is mixed with 0.0005 vol % of ethidium bromide solution (1mg/µl) alternatively ROTI-safe
A current of 120 V and 50mA is employed
Modifications
Fragments longer than 500 bp are separated in 0.8% - 1% agarose-TAE gels
Fragments shorter than 500 bp are separated in 2% agarose-TAE gels
Materials
TAE-solution (50x batch)
Tris base 242 g
Glacial Acetic Acid 57.1 mL
0.5M EDTA 100 mL
