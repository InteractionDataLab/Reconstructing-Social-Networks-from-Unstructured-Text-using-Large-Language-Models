T4 DNA Ligase
About
T4 DNA ligase is an enzyme that facilitates the joining of DNA stands by catalyzing phosphodiester bonds. It was isolated from bacteriophage T4 and is used to generate recombinant DNA sequences.[1]
Working conditions
For ligating extended oligos in a PCR reaction it is necessary to have phosphorilated 5'-ends. Oligos will only be ligated when they are assembled on a compementary strand. [2]
