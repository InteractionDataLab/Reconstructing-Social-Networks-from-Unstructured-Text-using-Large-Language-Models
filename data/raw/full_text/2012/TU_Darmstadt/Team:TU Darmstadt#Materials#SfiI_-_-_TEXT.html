About
SfiI is a endonucleasic restriction enzyme isolated from Streptomyces fimbriatus. It creates stick ends with 3' end overhang.
Working conditions
The recognition motive of SfiI is:[1]
5' GGCCN5GGCC --> 5' ---GGCCNNNN   NGGCC--- 3' 3' CCGGN5CCGG --> 3' ---CCGGN   NNNNCCGG--- 5'
Buffer: NEBuffer 4 + BSA
SfiI requires at least 4bp overhang on its cutting site (93% cleavage efficiency).[2]
