Dephosphorylation
About
Antarctic Phosphatase catalyzes the removal of 5' phosphate groups of DNA and RNA and thus prevents re-ligation of cut vectors. It is used before ligation.
Procedure
The reaction mix contains:
up to 5 µg of digested DNA (no purification needed)
1 µL of Antarctic Phosphatase
1/10 of reaction volume of 10x Antarctic Phosphatase Reaction Buffer
1 µL of Antarctic Phosphatase
Incubate at 37° C for 30 minutes (3' ends) or 60 minutes (5' ends)
Heat inactivate at 65° C for 15 minutes
Continue with ligation
