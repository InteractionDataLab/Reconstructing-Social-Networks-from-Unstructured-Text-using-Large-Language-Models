Sponsors
We wish to thank the following companys and people for their support. Without their generous contributions and input the iGEM participation of the Technische Universiät Darmstadt would not have been possible.
AppliChem
AppliChem GmbH (Darmstadt, Germany) produces chemicals for chemical, biological, pharmaceutical and medical research and production and markets them worldwide. The main product lines are:
BioChemica
AppliChem offers a wide range of biochemicals for biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology and molecular biology. A further focus at AppliChem is the development and production of decontamination reagents such as our trademark DNA-ExitusPlus™.
Chemica
This product line includes chemicals and reagents such as standard volumetric solutions, acids and bases, salts of the sulfonic acids for IPC, ready-to-use- buffer solutions, dye solutions and many more. A major part of the Chemica products are manufactured in our labs.
Custom Synthesis and other Services
We offer single-step and multi-step synthesis, building blocks for combinatorial chemistry or even synthesis elaboration from concept to start-up.
Binder
BINDER is the world's leading specialist in simulation chambers for scientific and industrial laboratories. Sales top 23,000 units per year that are exclusively produced in the factory in Tuttlingen.
Cutting-edge technology, groundbreaking innovations and absolute precision shape the brand image of BINDER. The main focus is on the perfect simulation of biological, chemical and physical environmental conditions for a variety of industries. The three red triangles stand for superior products, best service packages and professional advice. This is "Best conditions for your success".
In addition to the versatile productlines, BINDER offers its customers a wide selection of options and accessories.
From its headquarters in Tuttlingen and the four BINDER sales offices in New York, Moscow, Hong Kong and Shanghai, as well as numerous distribution partners, BINDER advises and supervises customers in over 135 countries.
Biospring
BioSpring is a chemical company which produces synthetic oligonucleotides in any quantity for all applications:
Therapy
Diagnostics
Molecular biology
Research and development
We offer our customers the entire range of modified and unmodified oligonucleotides, including RNA chimeras and/or very long DNA/ RNA molecules. You, the customer, set the limits of the nucleic acid synthesis.
Since 1997 our company has been synthesising nucleic acid products to meet the needs of a steadily changing market.
Flexible products require variable solutions without ever compromising on quality.
We have always managed to find acceptable solutions for our customers, regardless how complex the synthesis product or how large the synthesis scale required. Using the open source system designed for you, we maintain the highest degree of quality for each and every product. And, finally, our analyses give you the security that you have received what you ordered – guaranteed. website
Brain
BRAIN discovers and develops novel natural BioActive compounds, microbial producer strains, proprietary enzymes and biocatalysts for its customers in the chemical and pharmaceutical as well as in the food and cosmetics industries.
In an unique approach to the discovery and production of new biological compounds and biocatalysts the company harnesses creative solutions from nature`s untapped BioDiversity. Its success is built on its proprietary BioArchive comprising millions of genes, proteins, natural compounds and metagenome libraries from microbial isolates and complete habitats.
BRAIN was founded in 1993 and has developed into one of Europe`s leading industrial or white biotech companies. For more information feel free to visit their website .
Carl Roth
ROTH - Your partner for high-quality performance labware, life science and chemicals.
Carl Roth GmbH + Co. KG is a global supplier for companys, laboratories and scientific facilities with sophisticated demands on selected products for Life Science and chemicals. The company is located at Karlsruhe for more than 130 years.
Carl Roth is well-respected for their excellent product quality their sortiment and their special services: expert advice – on-site, fair prices and short delivery times.
