About
SpeI is a endonucleasic restriction enzyme isolated from Sphaerotilus natans. It creates stick ends with 5' end overhang.
Working conditions
The recognition motive of SpeI is:[1]
5' ACTAGT --> 5'---A     CTAGT---3' 3' TGATCA --> 3'---TGATC     A---5'
Buffer: NEBuffer 2 + BSA
SpeI requires at least 2bp overhang on its cutting site (100% cleavage efficiency).[2]
