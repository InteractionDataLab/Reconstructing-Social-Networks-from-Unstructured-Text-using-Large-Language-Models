Chemicals & consumables
3% milk powder PBS buffer pH=7.4
1.5% milk powder PBS buffer pH=7.4
0.05% Tween 20 in PBS pH=7.4
Antibody (mouse-antimyc)
antibody (goat-antimouse-AP)

Blotting buffer
AP buffer
nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman Nitrocellulose membran)
filter paper
Procedure
Transfer
seperate proteins via SDS gel ( SDS PAGE )
put 3 layers of filter paper (drenched in Blotting buffer ) on the graphite diode of the apparatus
cover it with nitrocellulose membrane with the size of your SDS gel
place SDS gel on top of it (should be wet)
cover it  with 3 layers of filter paper (drenched in Blotting buffer )
put cathode on top of the apparatus
transfer of from SDS gel to membrane is performed by adding a constant current of 12 V for 1 h
afterwards the nitrocellulose membrane, carrying the proteins, is blocked by incubating it in 3% milk powder PBS buffer for 2 h at room temperature or over night at 4°C
Staining
wash membrane with Tween PBS buffer 3x for 5 min each
add 1.5% milk powder PBS carrying 1. antibody in 1:1000 concentration
incubate for at least one hour at RT, keep shaking the whole time
wash membrane with Tween PBS buffer 3x for 5 min each
add 1.5% milk powder PBS carrying 2. antibody in 1:10000 concentration
incubate for at least one hour at RT, keep shaking the whole time
wash membrane with Tween PBS buffer 3x for 5 min each
wash membrane with ddH2 once for 5 min
add AP buffer, 20  µL of NBT and 70 µL of BCIP
keep shaking for 1 h
