Electrocompetent cells
The transformation of E. coli with plasmid DNA via electroporation according to Dower et al. requires electrocompetent cells.
Materials
Equipment
-80°C freezer
Incubation shaker
Centrifuge (cooling cababilities required!)
OD meter
Ice water bath
Chemicals & consumables
Ice and/or liquid nitrogen
Falcon tubes
dYT Medium (50 ml p.c.)
ice cold ddH2O (95+ ml p.c.)
Procedure
Cultivate the cells in 50 ml dYT with a starting OD600 of 0.1 at 37°C and 180 U/min
At an OD600 of 0.5 transfer the cells to a sterile Falcon tube
harvesting of the cells is performed with centrifugation at 4000 U/min 4°C
Wash the cells with an decreasing volume of 50/30/15 ml (discard the supernatant)
use some of the supernatant in the last centrifugation step to resuspend the cells
Notes
Important: Cooling must be maintained at all times.
