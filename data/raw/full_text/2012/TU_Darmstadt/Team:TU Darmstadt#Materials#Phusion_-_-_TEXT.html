About
Phusion is a Pyrococcus Pfu-like DNA polymerase with a dobule-strand DNA binding domain, resulting in an enhanced processivity and higher activity than other available DNA polymerases like taq and creates blunt ends.
Working conditions
98°C denaturation temperature
~30 s/kb extension velocity (at 72°C)
(TM-3)°C=TA
