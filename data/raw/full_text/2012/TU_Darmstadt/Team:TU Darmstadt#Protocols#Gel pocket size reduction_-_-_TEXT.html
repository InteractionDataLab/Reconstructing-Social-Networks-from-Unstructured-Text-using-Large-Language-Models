Gel pocket size reduction
Sometimes, when it comes to adding the samples to the agarose gel, it may happen that one does realise, that there are not enough pockets. This would usually result in pouring a new gel, but what if there is not enough agarose left or one is in a hurry?
We improvised a method for gel pocket size reduction, making it possible to split one pocket into two.
Required tools
Agarose gel
some excess agarose (less than 20µl worked in our case)
a ruler or any other improvised support
a mauly
a pipet tip
Instruction
Cut of a piece of the pipet tip so that it does fit smoothly in the gel pocket
Fix the upper section of the tip on the ruler/support using the mauly
Put the construction on your gel puring chamber (already filled (isert the tip in the pocket at 3/4 of its width))
Add a small volume of agar solution to the side of the tip with more space and let the agar dry (~3 min)
Remove the tip an use the gel
