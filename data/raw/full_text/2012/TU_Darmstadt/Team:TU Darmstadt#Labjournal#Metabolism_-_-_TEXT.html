Labjournal Metabolism
This lab journal describes a isolation and characterisation of the terephthalic acid 1,2-dioxigenase system and an dihydrodiol decarboxylase from Comamonas testosteroni KF-1 in Escherichia Coli. The strain was purchased from DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganism and Cell Cultures (DSMZ no. 14576 ). For more informations you will see our project discription .

Functional testing of BBa_J23100-xylE-dT
We inoculated 2 x 50 mL LB-media -ampicilin with 10 µl of the glycerine stock BBa_J23100-xylE-dT
After incubation we centrifuged the culture at 4600x g for 10 minutes
We resuspended each pellet in 3 mL PBS buffer and added PBS to 120 ml
We added 2 mL of 0.5 M catechol solution to the first cell suspension
We added 2 ml of 0.5 M protocatechuic acid to the second cell suspenion
We observed in either colony a colour change from colourless to light yellow.
Conclusion: XylE accepted protocatechuic acid as a substrate.
Kinetic assay of XylE with protocatechuic acid as a substrate
We inoculated 50 mL LB-media -ampicilin with 10 µl of the glycerine stock BBa_J23100-xylE-dT
After incubation we centrifuged the culture at 4600x g for 10 minutes
We resuspended each pellet in 3 mL PBS buffer and added PBS to 15 ml
After cell disruption we centrifuged the suspension at 9600 rpm for 20 min and decanted the supernatant in a fresh tube.
For the kinetic measurements we prepared the following standard concentrations:

Purification of TphA2
Protein purification according to standard strep-tag purification protocol
Note: We didn't perform an SDS-Page from the purification.
week 19 (17.-21.09.12)
Gel permeation chromatography
We performed the GPC with the following conditions:
Instrument
Pharmacia FPLC System
Colum
Superose 6 10/30
Mobile phase
PBS pH 7.4
Detector
280 nm
Flow rate
0.5 ml/min
Progam
Isocatic
We injected 50 µl of fraction 3 from each protein (TphA1, TphA2, TphA3, TphB and AroY) for analysis of the molar mass and the oligomerization.
Results:
GPC analysis of TphA3. The Peak of TphA3 has a retention time of 33 minutes. This retention time corresponds to a molar mass of 52 kDa, approximately.
GPC analysis of TphB. The Peak of TphB has a retention time of 32.5 minutes. This retention time corresponds to a molar mass of 64 kDa, approximately. The peak at minute 13 is an undefined contamination.
GPC analysis of AroY. The Peak of AroY has a retention time of 28 minutes. This retention time corresponds to a molar mass of 285.4 kDa, approximately.
Note: The GPC analysis of TphA2 and TphA1 respectively didn't work. The peak at 39 minutes is desthiobiotin from the protein purification.
Operon Construction
After several failed cloning attempts a test restriction digest was performed
Test restriction of J61002-RBS-tphA1-RBS-tphA2-RBS-tphA3-RBS-tphB, J61002-aroY and BBa_K316003 (far left: Lambda DNA/Eco47I (AvaII) Marker, 13)
J61002-RBS-tphA1-RBS-tphA2-RBS-tphA3-RBS-tphB showed unexpected bands although only one was expected after cutting with SpeI and PstI
BBa_K316003 showed two bands when cut with PstI and SpeI and PstI respectively where only one was expected
This lead us to the assumption that our PstI enzyme was contaminated with EcoRI (note the slightly differences between BBa_K316003 cut with SpeI and PstI and BBa_K316003 cut with XbaI and PstI)
Nevertheless also J61002-RBS-tphA1-RBS-tphA2-RBS-tphA3-RBS-tphB seemed to possess mutation(s) introducing new recognition sites for SpeI and/or PstI
As we lacked time to confirm our assumptions by sequencing we decided to cancel further operon construction
week 20 (24.-26.09.12)
Enzyme assays
Tph enzymes
For the protocol, see here
We didn't measure the activity.
AroY
For the protocol, see here
Before the addition of XylE we observed a brown solution. The brown color is typical for 1,2-Benzoquinone.
After the addition of XylE we observed a very high activity.
Functional test for AroY:
1) AroY with 50 mM Protocatechuate after 24 h;
2) after addition of XylE and 10 min incubation
