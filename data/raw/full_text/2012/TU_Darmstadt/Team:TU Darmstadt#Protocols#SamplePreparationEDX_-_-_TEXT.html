Overview
Benefits
Preparation of Escherichia Coli for the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
For the EDX measument the cells have to be fixed, embedded in a SPURR-embedding medium (resin) and cut in to small rectangles smaller than 100 nm.

Fixation
NOTE: The pellet must be about 0.25 g and the preparation takes about 4 days
Primary Fixation-step
give about 1 ml pre-fixationmixure to your pellet and incubate at room temperature for at least  1 hour
NOTE: you have to centrifuged your pellet after each step (about 30-45 sec at max. rpm)
Washing-step
wash your pellet 4 times with about 750 µL 0.1 M Cacodylate-buffer (CaCo) pH 7.4 for at least 15 min at RT
Secondary fixation-step
give about 750 µL  0.5 % Osmium in 0.1 M CaCo Puffer pH 7.4 to your pelett and incubate at RT at least 1 hour
washing-step
wash your pellet 2 times with about 750 µL 0.1 M CaCo buffer pH 7.4 for  at least 10 min and 2 times with bidest.  H2O for 10 min
Dehydration
give to your pellett about 750µL 30%,50%,90%,100% acetone and incubate each pellet at RT for  at least 10 min
give to your pelett about 750µL 100% acetone (dried)  and incubate 2 times at RT for at least15 min
Infiltration
give to your pelett about 500µL 25 % SPURR (in acetone) and incubate at RT for at least 45 min
give to your pelett about 500µL 50 % SPURR (in acetone) and incubate at RT for at least 45 min
give to your pelett about 500µL 75 % SPURR (in acetone) and incubate at RT for at least 45 min
give to your pelett  2 times about 500µL 100 % SPURR (in acetone) and incubate at RT for at least
give to your pelett about 500µL 100 % SPURR (in acetone) and incubate at 4 °C overnight.
Polymerisation
NOTE: your pellet have to be on the bottom of the capsule
give to your pelett fresh mixed SPURR and fill a part of your pellet into a capsule and incubate at 74°C over night.
Cutting
cut your polymererised capsule with a.... in a thicker than 100 nm rectangles
your sample ist ready for EDX
Mixtures
