Purification of Periplasmatic Proteins
Materials
Resuspension buffer
10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.8
ice
Ammoniumsulfate
Centrifuge
Procedure
1 L cell culture centrifugate at 6500 rpm for 20 min
Discard the supernatant
Resolve the pellet in 20 mL ice cooled resuspension buffer
Combine the solved pellets
Shake for 30 min at 100 rpm on ice
Centrifugate again at 6500 rpm for 10 min
Repeat step 2-6
Fill supernatant in a new flask
Add 130 g ammonimsulfate
Stir on ice until the ammoniumsulfate is solved
Protein flocculates
Centrifugate at 10000 rpm for 10 min
Discard supernatant
Leave the pellet for 5 min on ice
Remove buffer with pipette
Resolve the pellet in PBS
Purificate the suspension with e.g. IMAC
