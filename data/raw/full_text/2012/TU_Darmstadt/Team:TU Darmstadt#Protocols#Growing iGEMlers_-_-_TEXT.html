iGEMler growth / Requirements
Induction / lag phase
One person to come up with the iGEM topic
Some [in our case at least 7] people to get started
A brilliant idea
Darwins will to survive
Find a volluntary professor to temporary lend you his workspace / manpower (just don't tell the manpower part jet)
Early log Phase
Putting posters everywhere
Telling everyone how cool iGEM is and that it was initiated by the MIT (the TU Darmstadt rocks!)
log Phase
Getting the first feedback!
Friends bringing friends effect
...
stationary phase
The actuall work is to be dealt with
Start of the 40h weeks
Labwork
A LOT of coffee
Early death phase
Upcoming jamboree
Cells won't grow
Only days left to the wiki freezdown
Everything needs to be done
Running low on coffee
No sleep...
...
Death phase
Work is dealt with
iGEM is over ...
Returning home and getting to know the own parents and/or friends again
