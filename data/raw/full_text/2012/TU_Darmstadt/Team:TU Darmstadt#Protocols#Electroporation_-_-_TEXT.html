Electroporation
About
Electroporation is a transformation method. Genetic material is transfered into competent cells by an electric pulse.
Procedure
Defrost a stock of competent cells on ice
Mix it with 1 µL of plasmid
Transfer the mixture in an electroporation cuvette
Use the following settings for electroporation: 200 Ohm resistance, 2.5 kV current , 2 µF capacity and 2 mm capacitor plate distance
Pulse
Add 1 mL of DYT medium to cell suspension directly after the pulse and incubate at 37°C for 1 h
Finally the cells are ready to be crossed out
Notes
Important: Use only clean cuvettes for electroporation and wash them very carefully
Make sure that the cuvettes are perfectly dry to reduce the risk of a shortcut
Impurities in the plasmid may lead to an arc, if this does occur add small volumes of ddH2O to reduce the conductivity
