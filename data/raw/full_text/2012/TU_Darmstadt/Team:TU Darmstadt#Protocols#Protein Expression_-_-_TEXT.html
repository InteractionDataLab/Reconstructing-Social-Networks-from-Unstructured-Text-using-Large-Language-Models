Standard Protocol Protein Expression
Materials
DYT medium
100 mL and 3 L flasks
E.coli BL21 SHuffle for pET26b-Est13 and BmH7118 for pEX-FsC
1 mM stock of isopropyl-ß-D-thiogalactopyranosid (IPTG)
incubator
photometer
kanamycin
ice
Protein Expression Est13
Inoculation of 50 mL DYT medium in the 100 mL flask with E.coli BL21 SHuffle containing pET26b plasmid with the sequence for the protein Est13. Addition of the 15 µL kanamycin to the medium.
Incubation at 180 repulsion per minute (rpm) at 30°C to an OD600= 4.
Transferation of the starter culture into 1 L DYT medium in a 3 L flask resulting in an OD600= 0.2. Addition of 300 µL kanamycin.
Incubation to an OD600= 0.6 at 180 rpm and 30°C.
Incubation for 15 min. on ice.
Induction of the proteinexpression with 0.8 mL of IPTG (stock conentration 1mM).
Incubation of the cell suspension over night at 180 rpm at 16°C.
Protein Expression FsC
Inoculation of 50 mL DYT medium in the 100 mL flask with E.coli BmH7118 containing pEX plasmid with the sequence for the protein FsC. Addition of the 15 µL kanamycin to the medium.
Incubation at 180 repulsion per minute (rpm) at 30°C to an OD600= 4.
Transferation of the starter culture into 1 L DYT medium in the 3 L flask with that results in an OD600= 0.2. Addition of 300 µL kanamycin.
Incubation to an OD600= 0.6 at 180 rpm and 30°C.
Incubation for 15 min. on ice.
Induction of the proteinexpression with 0.8 mL of IPTG (stock conentration 1mM).
Incubation of the cell suspension over night at 180 rpm at 16°C.
