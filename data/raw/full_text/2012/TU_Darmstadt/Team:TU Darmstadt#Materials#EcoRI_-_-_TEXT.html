About
EcoRI is a endonucleasic restriction enzyme isolated from Escherichia coli RY13 . It creates stick ends with 5' end overhang.
Working conditions
The recognition motive of EcoRI is:[1]
5' GAATTC --> 5'---G     AATTC---3' 3' CTTAAG --> 3'---CTTAA     G---5'
Buffer: NEBuffer EcoRI
EcoRI can exhibit star activity depending on the conditions present in the reaction and needs at least 1bp overhang on its cutting site.[2]
