Cooperation
Capacity for teamwork is one major feature and character of the iGEM competition . Since we first met team frankfurt at the Achema our paths crossed on several occasions. During these occasions we came up with the idea to give them support by modelling their enzymes. The simulations group performed modelling studies for three enzymes of the Frankfurt iGEM Team.
For the Saccharomyces HMG CoA Reductase and Sulfolobus GGPP Synthase we were not able to build homology models, but their Saccharomyces FPP Synthase (SFPPS) worked out. The results for the developed models can be seen in the following pictures.

The Sulfolobus GGPP Synthase (SGGPPS) sequence contains 262 residues in 1 molecule. We used 1VIZ chain A, 2F6U chain B and 3VK5 chain A.
For the target sequence of the Saccharomyces HMG CoA Reduktase (SHMGR) with 536 residues in 1 molecule. Hence the target sequence was the only available information we identified modelling templates by running various PSI-BLAST iterations. We used 1DQA chain A (Human Hmg-coa Reductase) and 2R4F chain A (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a Reductase). Unfortunately, our hybrid model could not be improved by copying parts from other models.
