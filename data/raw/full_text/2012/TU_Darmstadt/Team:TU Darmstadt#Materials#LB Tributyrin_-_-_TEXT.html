LB-Agar-Tributyrin
About
Modification of LB plates for hydrolytic activity detection. Tributyrin serves as a model substrate and is a good indicator for hydrolytic activity.
Ingredients
5 g tryptone
10 g yeast extract
5 g NaCl
15 g agar-agar
15 mL Tributyrin medium
5 g gum arabic
5 mL Tributyrin
ad. 15 mL dist. water
sonification for 45 min.
ad. 1 L dist. water
autoclave for 20 min. at 121°C
wait until the temperature decreased under 60°C and add the prefered antibiotic
pour the medium into petri plates (1 L LB-Agar is equal to 40 plates)
store the plates at 4°C
