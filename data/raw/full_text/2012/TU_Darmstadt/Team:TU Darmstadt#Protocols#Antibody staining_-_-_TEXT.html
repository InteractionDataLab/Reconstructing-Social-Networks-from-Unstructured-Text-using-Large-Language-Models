Antibody staining
Materials
ice bath
Centrifuge
PBS buffer pH 7.4
1. antibody (mouse-anti-myc)
2. antibody (goat-antimouse-biotin)
Streptavidin, R-phycoerythrin conjugate (SAPE)
Procedure
centrifuge 750 µL of cell suspension for 2 min in order to gain pellet
wash the pellet two times with 200 µL PBS buffer (after every wash centrifuge for 2 min)
add 30 µL of 1. antibody 1:10 concentration in PBS buffer
incubate suspension including antibody for 10 min. on ice
centrifuge for 2 min.
wash pellet three times with 200 µL PBS buffer (after every wash centrifuge for 2 min)
add 10 µL of 2. antibody 1:10 concentration in PBS buffer
incubate suspension including antibody for at least 30 min on ice
centrifuge for 2 min
wash pellet three times with 200 µL PBS buffer (after every wash centrifuge for 2 min)
add 10 µL of SAPE 1:10 concentration in PBS buffer
incubate on ice for 10 min.
wash two times with 200 µL PBS buffer
now your cells are ready to be detected via flow cytometry
