Mutagenic PCR
This site-directed mutagenesis is used to change particular base pairs in a piece of DNA.
Working principle
Figure 1.A shematic representation of mutagenic PCR
The basic procedure requires the synthesis of a short DNA primer. This synthetic primer contains the desired mutation and is complementary to the template DNA around the mutation site so it can hybridize with the DNA in the gene of interest. The mutation may be a single base change (a point mutation), multiple base changes, deletion or insertion. The single-stranded primer is then extended using a DNA polymerase, which copies the rest of the gene. The copied gene contains the mutated site, and is then introduced into a host cell as a vector and cloned. Finally, mutants were selected by restriction digestion with a disered restriction enzyme.
