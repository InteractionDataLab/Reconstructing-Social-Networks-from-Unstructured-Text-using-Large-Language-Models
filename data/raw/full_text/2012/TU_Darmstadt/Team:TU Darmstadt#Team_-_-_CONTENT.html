Biology
</P>Master of SOE PCR and SDS-bubblesMarie is one of the few remaining diploma of the TU Darmstadt and the only one of their kind that made it to our iGEM team.If you need someone to keep a cool head and a bunch of testosterone driven menfolk in control there is no way around her.She is skilled in all kind of genetic methods and even knows how to play the piano.<P><B>Jascha Dimer</B> M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>Master of SOE PCRAlthough it required some force to make Jascha join our iGEM team he never regretted joining us. Nor did we.Together with Marie he dealt with the isolation of FsC and Est13 via SOE PCR and kept up the working spirit.To start with iGEM was his chance to realize a project that involves going beyond the usual university project limits. We went far...<P><B>Adrian Eilingsfeld</B> M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>Trainee in BioBrick production and god of wikimediaAdrians objective was the construction of BioBricks based on the fusion proteins sub units.When time was running short he took up the challenge and started the wiki.He's a constant source of wicked ideas: He implemented the laser thermometer as labware, likes rockets and owns a 3D printer.<P><B>Philipp Rottmann</B> M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>Master of BioBrick production and god of overexpression of FsC/Est13Philipp represented our iGEM team on severall occasions, cared for our public relations, funding and to put us into good humor.Yet he insited to spend time in the laboratory. Without him the lab wouldn't be the same.He is one of the alltime enthusiastic kind who always gives a helping hand and makes teamwork a pleasant experience.<P><B>Renè Sahm</B> B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>God of activity assaysRenè joined the iGEM teams as soon as he heard about it.In the lab, playing Dota or Pen'n'Paper role plays, Renè is always in search of a challenge and gives his best while having a lot of fun. With his experience from earlier lab work he was a gain for our group<P><B>Arne Wehling</B> B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>Team leader and god of SOE PCRArne is a great team leader. He is confident and doesn't hesitate to kick ass if required but doesn't mind to pay attention to trivial matters.Although he classifies himself as a tough guy and trains boxing on a regular basis, the only one who ended up with a black  eye (twice) was himself, after some close quarter combats (sparring). He is extremely dedicated trying to bring science to the people.<P><B>Niklas Weber</B> PhD student of biochemistry
</P>Team Advisor and god of teaching molecular biology<P>As an advisor Niklas always gave his best. No matter when we could always trust in his expertise and experienceHe gave good advice and hope in even bad times, which we had definitly. We are glad to had him as an advisor</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Transport"> Transport </SPAN></H3><P>from left to right: Sebastian, Valentina, Malte/Max, Andreas
</P><P><B>Malte Blumenroth</B> B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>Master of competent <I>E. coli</I> cells. No one else produced better competent cells in our lab.He also did a good job developing a photometric system to measure TPA uptake. <P><B>Max Heumüller</B> B.Sc. Biology
</P>Master of translationMax couldn't spend much time in the wet lab,so he decided to translate our lab protocols.<P><B>Valentina Herbring</B> M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>Master of documentationValentina ist not only the &quot;Mama&quot; of our team, but also the helping hand in every situation.She went almost mad in the lab with Andreas but never left until work was done. In this lab italian passion met russion havoc. Beside beeing the Master of Documentation Vali also showed outstanding miniprep skills.<P><B>Andreas Schmidt</B> B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>Team leader and master of improvisationA russian dictator is nothing compared to this lab worker. Chaos seems to be a normal thing for Andi and a lab without chaos wouldn't be challenging enough. But he is also the only one who succeeds to find the right sample in the right moment.  Andreas basically lived in the lab for many weeks.<P><B>Sebastian Palluk</B> B.Sc. Biology
</P>Master of mutagenic PCRSebastian managed it to eliminate the PstI restriction site in tctA 505aa trying only one time, while others spent weeks fighting against it.He also managed to fight against the &quot;normal&quot; chaos in our lab  and spent many hours discussing strategies and design of new primers with Andreas. Sebastian was representing biologists in our lab, surrounded by chemists and biomolecular engineers.<H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Metabolism"> Metabolism </SPAN></H3><P><B>Sascha Hein</B> B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>Team leader and god of GLPSascha is a certified biological technical assistant and decided to lead the metabolism team.His internalized skills and knowledge on a variety of methods make him essential for succesfull labwork.He even went so far to be ready to sleep over at the lab.<P><B>Sven Rumpf</B> B.Sc. Chemistry
</P>Master of gel leak-proof gel chambersSven took iGEM as a chance to expand his skills on biotechnology.Nevertheless he taught us to assemble an SDS-PAGE thatcould withstand thousands of liters of resolving and stacking gel.<P><B>Daniel Sachs</B> B.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>Master of colony pickingDaniel is the perfect man for colony PCR.Unfortunately his transformation and ligation skills are afflictedby his tendency to lose tubes with plasmid DNA in his ice box.<H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Material_Science"> Material Science </SPAN></H3><P><B>Velten Horn</B> B.Sc. Chemistry 
</P>Master of AFM and PET synthesisVelten was the teams good soul keeping everybody calm in stressing situations.Entertaining everone in the long hours of using the AFM was one of his easiest tasks.If he wasn´t synthecising PET or taking AFM images he could be found playing smartphone games addictedly, emptying everyones batterie.<P><B>Jonas von Irmer</B> B.Sc. Chemistry
</P>Team leader, god of AFM and synthesisJonas evolved from a mere spectator to team leader. Showing an enormous desire to make a contribution.As a chemist he provided crucial skills and synthesised PET analoga.His endurance using the AFM lead to beautiful pictures but also a big pile of broken cantilevers.<P><B>Henner Zirpel</B> M.Sc. Chemistry
</P>Master of the vanishing productHenner lead the team until he began his studies abroad.He took care of PET synthesis being the first one ever to evaporate PET at a temperature of 170 °CNevertheless he was an excellent companion and pleasant to work with.<H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Simulation"> Simulation </SPAN></H3><P><B>Sven Jager</B> M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>God of <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Modeling" class="external text" rel="nofollow">simulation</A>Sven turned out to be our personal genius on simulation and modeling. When he presented his first data we were stunned and prettymuch didn't know what to say. As a consequence he reduced his data to a threshold that common people understand (images).Even though he usually evites lab work he ended up performing the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Protocols/GC-MS" class="external text" rel="nofollow">GC-MS measurements</A> with great success.<P><B>Henrik Cordes</B> M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>Under the watchful eyes of Sven Henrik performed homology modelings and MD simulations for the iGEM Frankfurt team as well as for our team. Some computers couldn't take it (crashed) but it was worth it ....<H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Wiki"> Wiki </SPAN></H3><P><B>Patrick Boba</B> PhD Biology (Bioinformatics)
</P>WikiPatrick was pretty much dragged into this mess.He helped setting up and proofread the modeling sectionand expanded his fields of operations when the time ran short.<P><B>Adrian Eilingsfeld</B> M.Sc. Biomolecular Engineering
</P>God of WikiAdrian pretty much pulled the short straw and ended up with the wiki and all its wonderful side effects: Sleep deprivation, mood swings, spontaneous burst of laughter and the infinite wisdom on ditching the wiki task next time it crosses his path.He is our secret weapon. He can be used in the dry and in the wet lab, always giving his best.<H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Human_Resources_.26_Coordination"> Human Resources &amp; Coordination </SPAN></H3><P><B>Henrik Cordes</B> M.Sc.
