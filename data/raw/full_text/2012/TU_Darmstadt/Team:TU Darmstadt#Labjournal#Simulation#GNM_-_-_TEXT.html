Gaussian network model
Theory
Nearly all biologically important processes such as enzyme catalysis,ligand binding and allosteric regulation occur on a large time-scale (micro- to millisecond). A Gaussian network model (GNM) is  a coarse-grained  representation of a protein as an network consisting of  balls and springs. In our approach, proteins are represented by balls corresponding to the CA –atom of each residue[1]⁠ . While Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations  are computational expensive,  a GNM calculation only needs a few seconds.
Computation
The dynamics of the structure in the GNM is described by the topology of contacts within the Kirchhoff matrix G. Thus in this  network of N interacting sites, the elements of G are computed as:
<math> \Gamma_{ij} = \left\{\begin{matrix}  -1, & \mbox{if } i \ne j & \mbox{and }R_{ij} \le r_c  \\  0, & \mbox{if } i \ne j & \mbox{and }R_{ij} > r_c  \\ -\sum_{j,j \ne i}^{N} \Gamma_{ij}, & \mbox{if } i = j \end{matrix}\right. <math>
where Rij is the distance between point i and j. We used Gamma as  the intra CA-contact matrix. The inverse of it describes correlations between ﬂuctuations within the proteins native state. The diagonal of the matrix is replaced by the sum of contacts of one CA-atom within the whole protein. After a singular value decomposition (SVD) we have calculated the normal modes of the protein. Slow modes describe functionally relevant residues within a biomolecule[2]⁠. The opposite,  Fast modes, represent an uncorrelated motion without significant changes in the structure.

A recent examination of the X-ray crystallographic B-factors of over 100 proteins showed that the GNM closely reproduces the experimental data [3]⁠.
Application to our Proteins
We computed the GNM in R [4]⁠ by using the BioPhysConnectoR [5]⁠ library.
