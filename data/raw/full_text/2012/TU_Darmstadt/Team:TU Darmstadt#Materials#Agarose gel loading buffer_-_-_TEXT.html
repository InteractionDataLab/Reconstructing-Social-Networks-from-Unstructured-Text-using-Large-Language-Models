Agarose gel loading buffer
About
Loading buffer also known as loading dye is mixed with DNA samples for use in agarose gel electrophoresis . It contains a dye to assess the progress of the electrolysis and reagents that render the samples denser than the running buffer (so that the samples sink in the well).[1]
Application
Loading dye usually comes in 5X concentration. To use, add and mix 1/5th volume dye/sample (in order to save material mixing on Parafilm is an option). It is crucial that the dye and the expected DNA size do not overlap. Take a look in the spec sheet provided with the stain.
