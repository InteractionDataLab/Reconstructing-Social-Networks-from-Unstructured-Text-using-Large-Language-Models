Heat Shock Transformation
About
Heat shock transformation is a method of bacterial transformation .
Procedure
Defrost stocks of competent cells (100 µL in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube) on ice
Add the DNA and incubate the suspension for 5 minutes on ice
Heat shock is done by incubating the cells for 1 minute at 42°C
Add 1 mL of DYT medium and incubate for 1 hour at 37°C in order to obtain antibiotic resistance
Finally the cells are ready to be crossed out
