About
PstI is a endonucleasic restriction enzyme isolated from Providencia stuartii 164 . It creates stick ends with 3' end overhang.
Working conditions
The recognition motive of EcoRI is:
5' CTGCAG --> 5'---CTGCA     G---3' 3' GACGTC --> 3'---G     ACGTC---5'
Buffer: NEBuffer 3 + BSA
PstI requires at least 1bp overhang on its cutting site (with reduced cleavage efficiency 37%), more than 3bp (98%) are recommended.[1]
