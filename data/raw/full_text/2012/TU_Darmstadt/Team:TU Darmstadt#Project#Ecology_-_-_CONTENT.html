The  project of the iGEM team of TU Darmstadt specifically addresses the area of waste management and waste water technology. The present information on <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Project/Ecology#Waste_Management" class="external text" rel="nofollow">waste management</A> was provided by Kathrin Jager and the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Project/Ecology#Wastewater_Engineering" class="external text" rel="nofollow">wastewater engineering</A> content by Carolin Groß. Their evaluation is primarily focussed on Germany and Europe. This is due to the fact that there is hardly any detailed information available on global PET distribution.

In 2008, were worldwide about 24 million tons of PET, used in the form of fibers and about 12 million tons of PET packaging. Even more than 1 million tons of films and other technical applications of PET were 2008 worldwide deployment problem (see picture 1).

When PET is however discarded, many problems arise because PET has a high shelf life in the environment and is very resistant to the influences of uv light or heat. Today, many plastic products are stored in landfills over long periods. When PET is added to a thermal utilization in the combustion process, there are also emerging toxic byproducts.
The discipline of Environmental Engineering is located in this issue of the waste treatment situation. A genetically modified microorganism, which has the ability to degrade plastics into its components and to metabolize these ingredients and produce high-quality and useful products of it, would be an ideal solution to the disposal problem of PET.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Use_of_PET_and_Material_Flow_Analysis"> Use of PET and Material Flow Analysis </SPAN></H3><P>Over the past few years the percentage of use of PET in Europe rose significantly. In Germany occures an increasing  consumption of PET bottles during the last few yeras. The market share of PET bottles for soft drinks in Germany increased from about 40% in 2002 to almost 80% in 2008.

This coherence is probably based on the initiation of the tin pawn throughout Germany.

</P><P>For further processing the PET is bought and processed into fibers. The fibers can be used for textile production and packaging material, such as egg cartons or even used for car or computer parts. Once these products have reached the end of its product life, they end up for disposal being mainly burned in incinerators, at high temperatures without producing toxic substances. When combustion takes place with insufficient temperature, it produces toxic byproducts. Due to the high energy value and low toxicity, PET can be used as an energy source.

</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_actual_situation_of_the_disposal_of_PET"> The actual situation of the disposal of PET </SPAN></H3><P>By the requirements of the EU legislation (WFD) and in Germany (new Recycling Act), the producers of products have to be include into the responsibility for the disposal. There is, by this product stewardship, a redemption penalty. Since PET can be used for a long time and is also the recycling returned to the circuit, the disposal is in accordance with the life cycle not in the foreground. Nevertheless, PET may eventually need to be disposed of, and then there is, for the producers in Germany and Europe, the opportunity to sell the PET on the commodities exchange.
The withdrawal of the no longer usable PET bottles (returnable) is first in the beverage market. Here ends the responsibility of the consumer. Mortgage drink bottles should be disposed by the consumer, via the Dual System Germany (DSD &quot;The Green Dot”) in the yellow recycling sacks or bins. The bottles of both collections are then transported to a local disposal company and treated there.
The bottles are crushed either in a shredding machine or in a scroll compressor. This process simultaneously devalued the PET beverage bottles. Thereafter, the material is brought in sorting.
Of these facilities, PET is automatic sorted in foreign materials and recyclable PET. PET separated in colored PET and clear PET. The material is then baled and either returned to the circulation or marketed under the Ordinance.
PET has a relatively high calorific value. That makes it interesting for combustion. The cement industry uses material like plastics for the firing of cement kilns. If the industries that use PET to fire, do not or no longer have access to the same extent to PET, it could lead to controversy.

The calorific value of PET is about the calorific value of paper, wood or lignite. But with a calorific value of 4 to 7 kWh / kg there are higher calorific alternatives.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Alternative_ways_of_the_recycling_of_PET_.28-bottles.29"> Alternative ways of the recycling of PET (-bottles) </SPAN></H3><P>In addition to the main recycling routes of PET, there are also other alternatives now. These alternatives exploitations make no significant contribution to the total amount and are mentioned only briefly. China is a large consumer of PET, which is traded on commodity exchanges. There are textiles produced from the PET fibers. This is the most common way for PET fibers, which are no longer returned to the circuit.
A group of students from Switzerland has developed a project that brings to aid acquisition of PET bottles, light in the &quot;slums&quot; of poorer Asian cities. Here is a PET bottle is filled with water and a little bleach and the lid sealed. This bottle is then passed through a hole in the ceiling of the hut, attached to the half. By the reflection of light striking on the outside of the bottle, this design brightens the room, how could a 55-watt light bulb.

</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:502px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Picture 9: PET Recycling, exploitation and disposal with PET.er</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>The microorganism may be initially recognized by the collection of PET bottles. Here the percentage of the PET which is no longer used for recycling, is discarded. For this proportion, there are usually fibers produced, which can be used for textiles and other manufactured packaging, such as egg cartons or other plastic parts such as computer parts can be made from this discarded plastic.
From this percentage, a part of this amount could be used for the disposal by the microorganism.
The second approach would be for the disposal of the products, which were produced from the discarded PET bottles. After the using phase of the products made from PET bottles, they will be disposed, mainly supplied by combustion.
At this point, to keep the proportion of harmful combustion less, it is possible to offer the microorganism as a further disposal way and in the future it may replace the complete combustion.

Among the techniques of wastewater treatment in recent years, in addition to mechanical (rake, sand trap and sedimentation) and biological processes (activated sludge) also chemical processes (precipitation and phosphate) and the use of membrane filters replaced.
Through the project, we asked ourselves how we can use the micro-organism in a water treatment plant in the future PET.er.
