All work was done by the team , except for the tasks outlined in the supporters section, this includes inaugurations into measurement methods like MS, AFM or ELISA reader.
We want to underline the independce of our project. We have not been influenced or led by any other than our student team members. Neither in the creative and beginning time nor in the practice phase, professors, instructors or companies took any kind of control over our iGEM project.
We are a team founded by students just for students.
For detailed informations about our supporters please visit our supporter section .
