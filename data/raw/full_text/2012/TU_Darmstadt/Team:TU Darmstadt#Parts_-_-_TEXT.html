BioBricks
This page contains the BioBricks that our team created and distributed to the registry . BioBricks are the standardised building blocks of synthetic biology, they usually consist of circular DNA ( plasmid ) and a DNA sequence coding for a specific function like a protein or a promotor. The finalised BioBrick is based on the pSB1C3 vector contains defined restrictions sites for an easy assembly and an chloramphenicol resistance for selection purposes.
In general three levels of complexity are distinguished:
Simple parts like proteins, promoters, RBS, terminators
Devices they consists of wired parts like a RBS in front of a protein sequence
Systems are interconnected devices (like ab electric circuit) e.g. a combination of promoter, RBS, protein and terminator
Via combination of parts and devices a wide range of new functions can be generated. Assembling multiple parts can be achieved by recombination of cut parts.
All parts, devices and systems are open source and available in the registry .
