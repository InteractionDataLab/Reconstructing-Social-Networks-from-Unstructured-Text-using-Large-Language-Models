Ethidium bromide
About
Ethidium bromide aka EtBr is a marker for nucleic acids in agarose gel electrophoresis . It does intercalate between DNA base pairs and fluorescents under UV light.
Application
For DNA staining the agarose gel is mixed with 0.0005 vol % of ethidium bromide solution (1mg/µl).
For more information take a look at the Agarose gele electrophoresis protocol .
Notes
CAUTION: EtBr is carcinogen and mutagen, the penetration time of EtBr on latex gloves is less than 5s, nitrile gloves must be worn![1]
Roti® SafeGelStain is a less toxic alternative.
Due to its hazardous properties EtBr must be handled and disposed accordingly.
