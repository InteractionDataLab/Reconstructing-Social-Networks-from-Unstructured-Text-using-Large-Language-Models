Ammonium acetate / Ethanol precipitation
About
Ammonium acetate precipitation is a method used to purify DNA by altering their solubility. It is a specific case of a  gerneral technique known as salting out .
Materials
Equipment
-40°C freezer
Centrifuge (cooling cababilities required!)
Heat block
Chemicals & consumables
Ammonium acetate 7M
97% EtOH
Eppis
ddH2O
Procedure
add 1/10 volume of 7M ammonium acetate to DNA solution
add 3 volumes 97% EtOH to DNA solution
precipitate for 2 hours at -20°C
centrifuge for 30 min at 13000 rpm and 4°C
discard supernatant
dry pellet for 30 min at 50°C
solve pellet in 30 µL water
Notes
Important: Cooling must be maintained at all times.
