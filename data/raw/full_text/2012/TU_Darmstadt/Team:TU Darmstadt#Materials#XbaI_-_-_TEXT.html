About
XbaI is a endonucleasic restriction enzyme isolated from Xanthomonas badrii . It creates stick ends with 5' end overhang.
Working conditions
The recognition motive of XbaI is:[1]
5' TCTAGA --> 5'---T     CTAGA---3' 3' AGATCT --> 3'---AGATC     T---5'
Buffer: NEBuffer 2 + BSA
SpeI requires at least 1bp overhang on its cutting site (99% cleavage efficiency).[2]
