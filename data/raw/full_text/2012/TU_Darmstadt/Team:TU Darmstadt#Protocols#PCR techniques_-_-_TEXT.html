PCR techniques
Several techniques have have been derived from the basic polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Below is an overiew of important PCR methods with links to individual pages for detailed information.
PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a method for exponentially amplifying a fragment of DNA in vitro.
Colony PCR is a PCR technique to detect DNA in bacterial colonies. Colonies are picked, lysed, and amplified by PCR. It is used to detect successful ligations or recombinations among large numbers of bacterial colonies.
