Nanjing-China 2012 is working on small interfering genetically engineered machine.

Engineered lettuce growing

siGEM at a glance
The essential and expanding roles of  small non coding RNAs are becoming clearer to us. More interestingly, plant  endogenous small RNAs through food intake directly influence gene expression in  animals (especially in liver) , as a recent study showed.  
We took advantage of this phenomenon, and made engineered lettuce producing  artificial small RNA for therapeutic purpose. We in this case chose PGC1-alpha,  whose high expression in liver can cause insulin resistance, as target. (More...  in project section)
Parts at a glance
Our team designed three main modules for  our project, si/mi RNA and green plant synthetic biology. They may serve as a  bit of ground work for future teams working on plant.
They are RNA generating module, T-DNA  module, and Barcode 2 module.
 RNA generating module make vegetable a  small RNA producing factory.
Parts in T-DNA module are used for  constructing customized binary vector for plant.
Barcode 2 module is a signature system  for engineered plant.

Sharing
You can simply use overlapping PCR to  switch the sequence of small RNAs in part BBa_K788002 to make your own parts and  plant. (Detail is available in the part registry BBa_K788002 ). Also, you can use part BBa_K788010 and BBa_K7880005 to make new binary vectors. And you may put the signature on  the plant you work with by adding a barcode 2 part at the end of your system  according to rules BBa_K880007 gave.
