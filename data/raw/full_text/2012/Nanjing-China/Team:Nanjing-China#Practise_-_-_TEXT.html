Human Practice : Biosafty Issues
BIOSAFETY & BIOETHICS
As our project  is all about genetically engineered vegetables and plant/food-derived siRNAs,  transgenic food security is the prior issue on our checking list. Several  methods are proposed for related issues.
 
Unlike all the  traditional transgenic food which focus on expression and accumulation of  certain small chemicals or proteins of clinical application, our project is  based on the idea of gene silencing or repressing through direct regulation on  the DNA level by siRNA. A general assessment of other potential targets of our  siRNA on Mouse/ Homo sapiens genome will be assessed. Since whether the  potential targets belong to coding sequences along with tissue/ organ/ period  specific problems, as well as hereditary variation problems (if we aim for mass  production of our vegetables) are to be considered, it’s almost a new project on  bioinformatics/

Human Practice : Communication And Public Awareness
GET STARTED: 2011 China Meet-up
The iGEM team, Nanjing China, got  started two months before the 2011 iGEM China Meet-up in University of Science  and Technology of China with great enthusiasm and a bunch of ideas. The team  members wanted to have fun and explore into modern biological technology which  goes far beyond college textbooks, a real scientific research. The idea of  synthetic biology and iGEM competition, along with projects carried out by  former iGEM teams, have provided us with an excellent resource for gaining  knowledge not only of splendid ideas from various research areas, but also of  advanced technology applied to solve the problems. During the meeting, students  and instructor from former iGEM teams in China paid a great effort promoting the  spirit of concerns for biosecurity. They also shared practical tips for the  competition.
 
SALOONS, LECTURE AND COOPERATION WITH SEU TEAMS
To promote the  idea of synthetic biology and the iGEM competition, we made presentations on  academic saloons held for undergraduate students and teachers. Because it’s the  first time that any team from Nanjing University has ever taken part in this  competition, we want to trigger the merging of future iGEMers.
 
A saloon was  first held on June 2, 2012, where our team member Chen Jiabao first gave a brief  introduction of iGEM competition to the chief faculty members and students in  our department. Actually before this saloon, starting from 2011 autumn, we had  visited some major laboratories in our department presenting previous iGEM  competitions. We were very excited about being the first iGEM team representing  NJU, and also proposed some ideas of the project we want to compete. We showed  proposals in different aspects of biology research so that faculty in our  department could decide which they were interested in, which could be carried  out on the basis of available facilities, and which could be qualified to  receive financial support. And our job partly encouraged the establishment of  the other team in our school, too.
 
 
One thing of  what’s great about taking part in iGEM is that we make new friends and get  together for new ideas just like we are in a big family. We meet with the other  three teams in Nanjing to talk about progress of each team and discuss about  solutions if any team encounters a problem. We had great time getting to know  each team and each individual student at the same time. Also, on September 20,  2012, our team was invited over by the two iGEM teams from Southeast University  (SEU), Nanjing, China, to visit their campus and introduce our project to  students in SEU.
 
On September  21, 2012, we held a special academic saloon on the very topic of iGEM and  synthetic biology, as well as presenting our project as we were close to the  Asia Regional. It turned out a great success. Our audiences were very interested  in our project and some of their questions were vital to improving our project  and presentation. We also invited iGEM team from SEU and an exchange student  from America background in biochemistry and microbiology to introduce their  projects, so as to give our audience more information and help broaden their  view when they consider being an iGEMer in the future.
 
 
LAB TOUR FOR OTHER STUDENTS
During 2012  summer, we encouraged other students to learn about our project by encouraging  them to observe or join our experiment. Instead of holding lectures for them, we  decided to introduce to them one by one whenever someone was interested in  having a look at our lab and our work. We thought it’s a better idea because  they could decide how long to stay themselves which was more practical  especially when you consider the actual condition during an annual summer  holiday. And by having such private conversation it’s easier for them to develop  deeper understanding towards our project.
