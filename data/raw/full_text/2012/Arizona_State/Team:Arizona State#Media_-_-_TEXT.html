In the News
The ASU iGEM team and our individual members have been featured in these news articles. Our activities are bringing more awareness of iGEM and Synthetic Biology to the Southwest.
10.19.12 Student team wins gold in synthetic biology competition
ASU News, Science & Tech. A team of Arizona State University undergraduates earned a gold medal and a spot in the international championship event for one of the world’s premiere student engineering and science
09.20.12 Students create biosensor to detect water contamination
The State Press. ASU students are working to create a biosensor for use in developing countries that can detect disease-causing bacteria in water.
09.14.12 Must a paper trail be paper?
Science Careers. Dr. Haynes shares her thoughts about how OpenWetWare notebooks enable open science.
09.10.12 Students create low-cost biosensor to detect contaminated water in developing nations
ASU News, Science & Tech. The ASU team started its research during the summer to prepare for the synthetic biology competition. Its goal is to create a user-friendly, DNA-based biosensor that can detect major pathogens. The low-cost device would be used in the field rather than in a laboratory.
09.09.12 ASU team vying for shot at synthetic biology championship
ASU News, Science & Tech. A team of nine Arizona State University students is participating in the premiere student competition in synthetic biology. The ASU squad will be at the America-West Regional Jamboree for iGEM – the international Genetically Engineered Machine competition – at Stanford University, Oct. 12-14.
09.07.12 Arizona State Students Develop Low-Cost Biosensor to Detect Contaminated Drinking Water
Inhabitat.com, Morgana Matus. Nine undergraduates from Arizona State University have made major strides in creating a low-cost biosensor capable of identifying dangerous waterborne pathogens.  Their efforts adressed the iGEM challenge to create a device for use in the field that could be made from standard, interchangeable parts.
