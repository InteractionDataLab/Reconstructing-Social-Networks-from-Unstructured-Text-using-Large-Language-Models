Note from Dr. Haynes: Hi Ryan. The judging form is here [1] .
Teams often create their own "Here's how we met the judging criteria" page because the Judging form isn't very personalized. Here is an example: https://2011.igem.org/Team:Harvard/Results/Accomplishments
The ASU page should include accomplishments met for Bronze, Silver, and Gold, and accomplishments that are relevant to any of the Special Prizes (Best Human Practice Advance, Best Experimental Measurement, Best Model) if applicable.
