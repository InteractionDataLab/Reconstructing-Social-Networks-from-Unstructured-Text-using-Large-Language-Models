University Outreach
Around the Campus
The ASU iGEM team publicized iGEM and synthetic biology by  placing our QR code (linking back to our wiki) around the campus as well as  flyers in common areas. The goal was to raise awareness and spark interest in  the student body.
ASU 101
Arizona State University holds a required introductory  course to introduce first-year students to the unique culture, challenges, and  opportunities at the nation’s largest university. Over 9,000 freshmen take this  course their first semester. By the end of the semester, all ASU freshmen will  know what is expected of them as college students and how to succeed. ASU’s  2012 iGEM team came to speak in the ASU 101 classes for science majors. The  team introduced the freshmen to the new field of synthetic biology. In  addition, the team informed the students about the iGEM foundation, about the  competition and ASU’s iGEM project this year, and how students can become  involved with iGEM.
Passport to ASU
Passport to ASU was on 22 August 2012.  Passport is an opportunity to reach thousands of students as part of Welcome Week activities. The iGEM team set-up a table and talked with fellow ASU students to recruit members for next year’s team, to publicize our project, and increase awareness of synthetic biology.
