Acknowledgments
Thank you to:
Dr. Karmella Haynes for providing us guidance and support throughout the whole iGEM process. She generously opened her lab for the iGEM team and provided access to various equipments such as a thermocycler, spectrophotometer and a Light Cycler. In addition to providing us access to various equipments, she also donated various reagents contributing to the success of our projects.
Dr. Xiao Wang for serving as one of the team mentors. Wang Lab provided us with lab space during the summer and also provided us with cells and reagents.
Dr. Vincent Pizziconi for serving as one of the team mentors and providing us with aspiring words throughout the summer. Dr. Pizziconi opened his lab, the Biomedical Engineering Design Studio and the conference room for this years iGEM team.
Dr. Miles Orchinik and Dr. Tsafrir Mor for providing us lab space during the summer. Additionally, we would like to thank Dr. Gary Tahmahkera for giving us continual support in answering any questions we had while we were there.
Kylie Standage-Beier for providing us with feedbacks on our projects and helping troubleshoot our experiments. He also generously donated cells, few DNA samples and few reagents due to back ordering.
Alizee Jenck who ran mass spectrometry for us to determine whether or not topoisomerase was covalently bound to single stranded DNA.
Jordan Nguyen for setting up the foundation for our Wiki.
James Alling for helping us edit our abstract as well as providing guidance for our ethics essay.
Eric Trang for helping us with creating the logo.
Dr. Thomas E. Grys, Mayo Clinic, for providing his feedbacks on the project and suggesting different applications of the device.
In terms of research materials, we would like to thank:
Case Western for providing us with the split-beta gal fragment sequences.
The University of Pennsylvania for the Topoisomerase samples.
Also, we would like to thank our sponsors who help fund the project:
Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering
School of Biological Health Systems Engineering
School of Life Sciences
School of Politics and Global Studies
