Human Practices Overview
We know that a biosensor is not the ultimate solution to stop childhood diarrhea so we created hygiene lesson plans to be implemented internationally in Guatemala.
We conducted case studies and mathematical models to predict when to implement our biosensor and how to evaluate the accuracy and the reliability of the device.
We addressed ethical consideration s regarding whether or not we should tell a community without the necessary resources that their water is contaminated and how to best implement our biosensor.
We gave presentations about synthetic biology the incoming ASU freshman science and engineering class. Also we had two high school interns over the summer from Bioscience High School. During the school year, we also presented at their schools.
