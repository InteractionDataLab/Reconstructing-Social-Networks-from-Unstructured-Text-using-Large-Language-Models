Helping
[ Back to the Results Page ]
As two teams from one school, Our team and SEU_A are connected tightly. Though working for different projects, we discussed about the idea together at the beginning, ran experiments in the same laboratory, shared all kind of reagent and a lot of valuable memories. During this process, the two teams helped each other a lot.
What we have done:
Xuelong Fan did most administrative work for both teams, such as fund raising and team registry.
In the discussion stage, Muyuan Chen is actually the first to come up with the idea of "Poisonous Apple", trying to kill other bacteria by inserting a plasmid with both "Sweet Gene" and "Death Gene" into the gene pool, which is later developed and partly realized by team SEU_A.
At the beginning of experiment, Shen Gao did a lot of work to introduce basic experiment operations to the junior members of SEU_A.
We held a lecture on synthetic biology as human practice together, in which Xiaodan Xu gave an impressive speech.
For confirmation, see their Attribution Page .
What they have done
SEU_A held a lecture on synthetic biology as human practice and invited our team and NJU to share ideas together. In which most of the organizational work is done by the member of SEU_A.
In the final stage of experiment, SEU_A helped us in providing bacteria caring pSB1C3 and the expression vector for verification experiment.
In the lab, SEU_A is responsible for most of the cleaning and disinfection work.
