Surviving in the harsh conditions of space is not easy for an organism.  Extreme temperatures, desiccation, and pressures are only some of the problems an intrepid bacterium might face on its journey.  We hope to equip our organisms with the ability to live and thrive in space, and maybe even Venus!
The surface of Venus is harsh and unforgiving.  However, research suggests that there may be layers of its atmosphere that are more temperate.  We aim to see whether or not it is possible for bacteria to survive and replicate in an aerosolized environment, and then put our Hell Cell to the test!
If we are to colonize space, we are going to need rare metals for materials. But bringing the heavy duty equipment for traditional mining is not very viable at all! Bacteria and other biological organisms can be used to extract rare metals from sediment. Bacteria could mine asteroids and do all the work for us!
