As is designed documently, we need to conduct the amplification of one promoter Purel and five genes including CcdB、CsgD、fdhF、pflB followed by structural splice and functinal detection using six vectors constructed from genes the official organizor sent us , the six vectors are LuxI-Ter、pV-cI、pC-LacI、LuxR、pR-cI and pT-LacI.
We have to complete three site-specific mutations on gene pflB and following functional detection, as well as having two gene fused and corresponding function detected so as to fullfill the requirements of submittion to the element library.
Amplify H+-sensitive promoter Purel from the gDNA of  Streptococcus salivarius strain 57.I.
