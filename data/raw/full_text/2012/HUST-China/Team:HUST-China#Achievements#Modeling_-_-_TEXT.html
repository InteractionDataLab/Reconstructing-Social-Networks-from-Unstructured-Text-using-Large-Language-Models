Modeling Achievements
Not only have we design bacterial batteries, but we modeled simplified pathway of bacterial batteries. In the project, we have constructed three models, the single cell model, multi-cell model, and CCDB-related model. All of these can co-attribute to this pathway.
1>Design of bacterial batteries
2>Simulation and calculation of the distribution of proton in panel
*Formation of hydrogen ion's concentration gradient
In our model, we first put up an idea about building a concentration gradient of hydrogen ions by wasted water. The two with different PH values are lay at opposite places, and were linked with each other by a narrow bucket, which can form the concentration gradient.
3>Quorum-Sensing
Simulate and calculate different molecules or cells with time-dependent concentration, i.e., AHL, cell-density, CCDB. The results can be showed in the three figures below.
1,AHL-time
2,Cell density-time
3,CCDB-time
4>Simulating the Quorum-Sensing and aggregation by constructing software named HUST-CAL 1.0
