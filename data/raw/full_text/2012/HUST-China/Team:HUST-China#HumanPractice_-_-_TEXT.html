Survey
Synthetic Biology and iGEM have been around for years now. Every year we see hundreds of curious and interesting projects at the jamboree: using E. coli to treat desertification, to draw a colorful rainbow, to produce diesel, and so much more. Since synthetic biology is a field combining science and engineering, it is extremely appealing to students with various majors. This year is the second time HUST iGEM team participates in the competition. We have designed a questionnaire to survey a number of professors and graduate students in our university on their opinions about synthetic biology and our project.
Interviewees whose answers we have chosen to share:
Anyuan Guo, Professor of Bioinformatics
Hui Liu, Post-doctor of Biostatics
Jun Yan, PhD of Biochemistry
Zhaowu Ma, PhD Candidate of Bioengineering
Yongbo Wang, PhD Candidate of Bioinformatics
1.Does synthetic biology affect your life?
"No, but I think it will be applied in and affect our life in a few days." - Anyuan Guo
"No, at least not yet. I hope to see it in the future." - Hui Liu
"Yes. They are already affecting our lives, for instance, some engineering bacteria are producing drugs, and some are producing food additives." - Yongbo Wang
"No, despite its application in industry. But it has little impact on our everyday life." - Jun Yan
2. Do you regard synthetic organisms as one of the most efficient ways to change the field of biology? And how?
"Yes. It will change the world dramatically if it is applied widely. However, it may arise a lot of ethic problems." - Anyuan Guo "I don’t think so." - Hui Liu
"Yes. It’s an effective way to change the world. It can be applied in varies fields, e.g. energy, environment, health care and etc. Used properly, synthetic biology can bring us more profit."
- Yongbo Wang
"Synthetic Biology is widely applied in the industrious fermentation and sewage treatment. But it should be more discreet when concerning ethics issues such as altering genetic information." - Jun Yan
3. What do you think of synthetic organisms? Would they be a calamity to us or lead us to flourishing?
"It depends on the users. It will be the worst in the hands of people with malign intentions." - Anyuan Guo
"In my opinion, synthetic organisms are the same as many other science application, a double-edged sword. Used properly, it brings advantages; used improperly, it brings harm." - Hui Liu
"The Synthetic Biology is advantageous within a certain range, for instance in the field of energy. However, beyond the range there may be unknown consequences." - Yongbo Wang
"The Synthetic Biology techniques will be a bless to all of us if under control." - Jun Yan
4. Do you think synthetic biology should be applied to human beings?
"No. It would be a lot of big problems when concerning human beings." - Anyuan Guo
"It is applicable, but we should not do so. The potential is unlimited, but should not be exploited."- Hui Liu
"It can be implemented in a way, but certain rules must be followed." - Yongbo Wang
"It’s not really necessary.” - Jun Yan
5. What future directions do you see for synthetic biology?
"Production of bioenergy using synthetic bacteria. It may solve the energy problem for the world." - Anyuan Guo
"I hope that the product of synthetic biology can stay in the lab much longer, rather than hurrying into peoples’ life." – Hui Liu
"Organ transplant, disease treatment, agricultural production." - Yongbo Wang
"Synthetic organs and disease treatment." - Jun Yan
Introduction of iGEM and Synthetic Biology to Freshmen 2012
Ever since the project began, the iGEMers of HUST have been “stuck” in labs, or fixated in front of their laptops for months. Therefore when new school year started, we decided to go out and smell the fresh air, also the fresh freshman boys and girls, and introduce them to the fantastic world of synthetic biology and iGEM. We have held numerous sharing meetings, having our team members introducing to the curious freshmen what synthetic biology is, what iGEM is about, what our project does, and so on. Before the meetings we were a little concerned that the young prospective scientists might be at a loss at what we were trying to convey, however we were surprised also glad to find that they were all so attracted to this new concept. Some of the students even came up with really thoughtful and professional questions, such as “How does parts standardization resemble any device in the electric circuit” or “What can I, a bioinformatics student, use my professional knowledge to aid gene network regulation”. We are almost certain that among these students will emerge future "activists" in the field of synthetic biology.
One meeting with students majoring in bioinformatics.
“I have never heard of synthetic biology before. I guess it might be related to synthetic drugs.”
Jianhao’s passionate introduction of iGEM.
Shuangyang, spreading the basic concept of mathematical modeling.
Finally, Yuliang, our team leader, showed up before the meeting ended, amusing the freshmen with his humor and shared his two-year experience in the HUST iGEM team.
