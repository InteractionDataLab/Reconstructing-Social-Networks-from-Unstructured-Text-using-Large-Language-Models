Lignocellulose Degradation Pathway
In order to break down lignocellulose into glucose molecules, we have planned to construct three pathways, aiming at: a) lignocellulose pretreatment/lignin degradation, b) cellulose degradation, and c) hemicellulose/xylan degradation. For each pathway to work, multiple enzymes are needed to work collaboratively. We have used standard cloning methods to construct secretory vectors pPICZα-ΒBa_K500000, pPICZα-BBa_K500001 and pPICZα-BBa_K500003 for pretreatment, 9k-BBa_K805011 and ZXFα-bglX for cellulose degradation, 9k-BBa_K805012 and ZXFα-BBa_K805010 for hemicellulose degradation.
Cell Surface Codisplay
We have planned to construct two whole-cell biocatalysts with the ability to induce synergistic and sequential cellulose and hemicellulose degradation reactions through codisplay of two types of degradation enzymes on each of the Pichia pastoris cell surface. Cell surface display technique fuses foreign protein with the surface of microorganisms and can enhance the activity of enzymes by concentrating them. We utilized the cell surface display technique to simultaneously codisplay endoglucanase as fusion protein with the N-terminal-half region of ankyrin Sed1 and β-glucosidase as fusion protein with the C-terminal–half region of α-agglutinin Aga2. The other codisplay system consists of endoxylanase as fusion protein with the C-terminal–half region of α-agglutinin Aga2 and β-xylosidase as fusion protein with the N-terminal-half region of ankyrin Sed1. Cell surface display was confirmed by observation of immunofluorescence-labeled cells with an upright fluorescence microscope, which will be introduced in the detection section.
Ethanol Fermentation
In order to convert glucose into ethanol and thereby produce cellular energy, we have planned to incubate our engineered yeast cells for fermentation. Ethanol fermentation is classified as anaerobic because yeasts perform this conversion in the absence of oxygen.
Detection
In order to make sure that several of our cell display enzymes are actually displayed on the surface of yeast, we utilized Immunofluorescence technique and Flow Cytometry to detect protein location and their relative abundance. Immunofluorescence technique uses the specificity of antibodies to their antigen to target fluorescent dyes to specific protein targets within a cell, and therefore allows detection and visualization of the distribution of our target proteins. We purchased Mouse Anti HA-Tag Polyclonal antibody and Fluorescein (FITC)–conjugated Affinipure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG(H+L) for the detection of endoxylanase gene xyn and β-glucosidase gene bglX, and Rabbit Anti Flag-Tag Polyclonal antibody and Goat Anti Rabbit RPE Polyclonal antibody for the detection of endoglucanase gene cel5A and β-xylosidase gene RuXyn. Flow cytometry was used to aid the analysis.
We have also used enzyme assay methods to detect the enzymatic activities of our secretory enzymes.
