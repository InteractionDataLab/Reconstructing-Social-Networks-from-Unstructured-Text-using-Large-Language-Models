Growth-based Biosensor
Growth-based Biosensor
Objective:
The aim is to model a growth-based biosensor and compare it with a model of a conventional non-growth based biosensor, which generally outputs GFP expression in response to an inducer. The growth-based biosensor will instead have as an output the expression of a gene which facilitates the availability of a substrate and thus increasing the growth rate of the organism. A candidate gene is sucrose hydrolase, which enables E. coli K12 to use sucrose as a carbon source.
