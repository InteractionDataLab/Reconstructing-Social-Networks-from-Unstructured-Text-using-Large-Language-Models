Questioning Friendliness
User-friendly, friendly lemon bacteria… But what is friendly?
We put a note in the elevator asking exactly this question (the elevator was a big part of our lives). This is what we got.
Unfortunately, before we can get other responses, someone ripped this piece of paper from the elevator noticeboard. This is not very ‘friendly’, is it?
We also wanted to see how people perceive controversial images e.g. Bad bacteria living in the toilet vs good yogurt bacteria.
We got a strong response with this one, both posters went missing. We miss them.
