Alternative selectable and counter-selectable markers:
Levansucrase (sacB)
Background
SacB is the levansucrase enzyme from Bacillus subtilis (Gay, Coq, Strinmetz, Ferrari, & Hoch, 1983) which converts sucrose into fructose polymers which are lethal to Esherichia coli (French & Kowal, 2010) . This part was deposited into the Registry by Team Edinburgh 2010 and can be used as a counter selectable marker (French & Kowal, 2010) . Our aim is to improve the part by assessing its counter selection efficiency.
Cloning
The plac-RFP fragment was obtained from the standard BioBrick plasmid and inserted in front of the sacB BioBrick. Method . The construct was confirmed with sequencing .
PCR of pSB1K3 plasmid (Kanamycin resistance) with psBNX3 insF2 forward primer (specific for BioBrick prefix) and dsred r2 reverse primer (specific for RFP) was prepared in order to obtain the plac-RFP fragment.
Figure 1: DNA gel of the PCR product from pSB1K3 amplification with primers specific to the BioBrick prefix and RFP. The band is abound 1 kb which corresponds to the expected size of plac-RFP.
Close the plasmid.
The plac-RFP PCR product was purified and digested with EcoRI HF and SpeI. The sacB BioBrick deposited in 2010 (French & Kowal, 2010) was digested with EcoRI and XbaI. These were ligated together after purification. E.coli cells were transformed with the ligation. The red transformants were minipreped, digested with EcoRI HF in order to linearise them and with EcoRI HF and PstI in order to check the size of the insert.

The idea of placing sacB under the control of the lac promoter is to create kanamycin-independent control. Moreover, by changing the IPTG levels, the level of selection can be controlled.
One of the weaknesses of sacB selection often mentioned in the literature is that sacB loss-of-function mutants also survive, and this may occur at higher frequency than loss of the cassette. RFP is added to ensure that cells which have lost the cassette (should be white because of loss of RFP) can be distinguished from cells which have lost SacB function (should be red as RFP is still present). This would allow us to assess the counter-selection efficiency of SacB.
We also prepared a Kan-plac-RFP-sacB selection-counterselection cassette.
Characterisation
The growth of SacB (bottom) and a control (top) were tested by adding 1.3 g solid sucrose plus 0.5 ml sterile water into a well in the middle of the plate, as shown in Figure 4 below..
Figure 4: A quick test of SacB transformants' growth in the presence of sucrose. The growth of SacB (bottom) is inhibited near the well in comparison to the control (top).
Citrobacter freundii
SacB and control (pSB1C3 only) transformants were streaked onto LB plates (with either cml40 or cml15) and solid sucrose was added to the regions indicated by the crosses or circles in Figure 5. The plates were incubated at 37°C overnight.
Figure  5: A quick test of sacB and control’s ability to grow in the presence of sucrose. The zone of clearance indicates that the cells containing sacB are inhibited by sucrose while the controls are unaffected. The control on the plate on the right is purple due to both expressing the RFP gene and turning blue because of the X-gal on the plate.
The bottom streak on plate on the left in Figure 5 contains cells that have the selection-counterselection cassette so this test shows that the counterselection component of the cassette is working.
We also tested the selection component of this cassette by streaking the cells onto plates containing both chloramphenicol and kanamycin and incubated overnight. These results can be seen in Figure 6.
Figure 6: Plate showing that the kanamycin resistance component of the selection-counterselection cassette works. The control did not grow at all, even after 4 days, as it was inhibited by the kanamycin, while the cells containing the cassette show growth. Growth is weaker because we have found that using the concentration of chloramphenicol we normally use (cml40) in combination with the sacB in Citrobacter freundii causes slower growth, presumably because levansucrase expression is unregulated in these bacteria which puts a strain on the cell.
Sugar-dependent selection-counterselection cassette concept
The reason we did not use our sucrose hydrolase gene for the selection component of the selection-counterselection cassette was because both it and levansucrase depend on the same substrate – sucrose – for their function, so this would have not yielded good results.
We have found that Citrobacter freundii can use sucrose as a sole carbon source without the need for the sucrose hydrolase gene – this means that if we want to develop a non-antibiotic resistance-dependent selection-counterselection cassette for this organism, we need to use a different sugar. One sugar that, according to our findings, Citrobacter freundii cannot use is xylitol – see our ‘Xylitol dehydrogenase’ section for more details on this. We could therefore combine this gene with the levansucrase gene to obtain an antibiotic resistance-independent selection-counterselection cassette that dependent entirely on sugars.
Levans
We have found that under sublethal doses of sucrose, the E. coli cells start to secrete a lot of gloopy substance, which we believe to be levans (Figure 7), the fructose polymers formed because of the levansucrase activity.
Figure 7: Secretion of levans outside of the cell – it is only present on the lower two colonies but is absent in the two controls above.
We find this important to mention, as levans have got several applications in various fields (Kang et al., 2009) .

Conclusions:
We prepared a plac-RFP-SacB construct which can be used for assessing counter-selection efficiency. ( BBa_K917002 )
We placed sacB under the lac promoter which allows IPTG dependent control rather than kanamycin dependent control and IPTG concentration-dependent control of the levels of selection.
We added RFP to allow distinguishing loss of the counter-selection cassette form loss of SacB fuction.
We prepared and characterized a Kan-plac-RFP-sacB selection-counterselection cassette in both E. coli and Citrobacter freundii ( BBa_K917010 )
