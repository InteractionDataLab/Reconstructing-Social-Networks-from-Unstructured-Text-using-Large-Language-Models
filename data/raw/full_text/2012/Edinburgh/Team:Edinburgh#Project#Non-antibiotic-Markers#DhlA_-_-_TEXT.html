Alternative selectable and counter-selectable markers:
Haloalkane dehalogenase (dhlA)
Background
DhlA is haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 (Keuning, Janssen, & Witholt, 1985) . It converts 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) into the more toxic 2-chloroethanol and is successfully used as a counterselectable marker in plants (Naested, Fennema, Hao, Andersen, Janssen, & Mundy, 1999) . This is why we decided to assess its suitability as a counter-selectable marker in bacteria.
Cloning
PCR amplification of BS-dhlA with these primers resulted in no product.

Reverse primer: gact ctgcag cggccgc t actagt a tta t tattc tgtct cggca aagtg
Figure 1: DNA gel of PCR amplification of BS-dhlA with dhlA designed primer resulted in no bands.
Close the primers.
Characterization
Plates
To test how suitable dhlA is as counterselectable marker, BS-control  and BS-dhlA strains were grown in the presence or absence of DCA. Both strains showed similar growth in both the presence or absence of DCA (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Comparison of growth of BS-contol and BS-dhlA at 0 ul and 20 ul DCA. Both strains showed similar growth in the presence or absence of DCA.
Liquid cultures
Liquid cultures with different DCA concentrations of both BS-control and BS-dhlA were prepared. No distinct difference between the growths of the two strains was evident (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Comparison of growth of BS-contol and BS-dhlA in liquid cultures with varying DCA concentrations. Both strains showed similar growth.
Conclusion:
We extensively characterized the dehalogenase enzyme on plates and in liquid cultures.
We determined that it is not suitable as a counterselectable marker.
Further plans:
To BioBrick it as it can be used in bioremediation (it can break down halogenated compounds).

Methods (expand)
Inserting gene into a biobrick vecor: Cloning a PCR product into a biobrick vector protocol on OpenWetWare (http://openwetware.org/wiki/Cfrench:bbcloning) however NEB buffers were used.
DNA gel preparation: Analysing DNA by gel electrophoresis protocol on OpanWetWare (http://openwetware.org/wiki/Cfrench:AGE) however 0.5*TAE rather than 1*TAE was used.
Colony PCR screen: Screening colonies by PCR protocol on OpenWetWare http://openwetware.org/wiki/Cfrench:PCRScreening
Transformations: Preparing and using compenent E.coli cells protocol on OpenWetWare (http://openwetware.org/wiki/Cfrench:compcellprep1)
PCR reactions : Cloning parts by PCR with Kod polymerase protocol on OpenWetWare (http://openwetware.org/wiki/Cfrench:KodPCR)
Minipreps : Plasmid DNA minipreps from Escerichia coli JM109 and similar strains protocol on OpenWetWare (http://openwetware.org/wiki/Cfrench:minipreps1)
Digests to linearise the DNA frangment/determine size of insert: Analytical restriction digests protocol on OpenWetWare (http://openwetware.org/wiki/Cfrench:restriction1)
DNA purification: Purifying a PCR product from solution protocol on OpenWetWare (http://openwetware.org/wiki/Cfrench:DNAPurification1) however 165 ul NaI, 5 ul glass beads,180 ul wash buffer and 10 ul EB were used.
DNA preparation for sequencing: 2.5 ul miniprepped DNA, 2 ul water and 1 ul forward primer ( specific for biobrick prefix) or reverse primer (specific for biobrick suffix)
Nitroreductase activity assay: Overnight liquid cultures of nitroreductase strains were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 5 mins to pellet the cells. The cells were then resuspended in 250 ul PBS and 1 ul DTT to ensure that cellular proteins are not oxidized. The solution was sonicated 6* (10 s sonication+20 s rest). The supernatant was separated from the pellet by centrifugation and used for the NADH-dependent nitroreductase activity assay.
To assess background activity NADH (5 ul) and bacterial supernatant (5 ul) were added to 0.8 ml PBS and mixed. OD340 was measured for 1 minute. DNBA(5 ul) was added to the same cuvette to start the reaction and change in OD340 was monitored for 1 minute. DMSO(5 ul) was used a control (DNBA is dissolved in DMSO)
The protein concentration of each of the supernants was estimated by by Bradford protein assay using the Pierce reagent protocol on OpenWetWare(http://openwetware.org/wiki/Cfrench:ProteinAssay)
