Tools that Make Synthetic Biology Easier and Safer
– Questioning Legacy and Friendliness.
Welcome to the official wiki of EdiGEM - the Edinburgh team for iGEM 2012!
We aim is to design new biological systems that will make synthetic biology more accessible and friendly. Our team plans to achieve this by constructing a bio-electric interface, designing new selectable and counterselectable markers and characterising Citrobacter freundii to start a dialogue on what a synthetic-biology specific chassis should look like. To find more about our project have a look at the Project page . Or, alternatively, watch the video abstract below.
However, if you are short for time, you may want to have a look at EdiGEM's Concise Project Description .
