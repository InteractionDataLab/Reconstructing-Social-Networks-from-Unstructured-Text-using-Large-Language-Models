Failure
Failure is an integral part of life. However, no one likes to talk about it. Particularly when it comes to science; failure is more than an uncomfortable topic, it is kind of a taboo. Why are people so afraid of failing?
We, this summer met with a lot of failures along the way. It was not nice but instead of hiding them, we are sharing them:
DhlA
Nitroreductase Plates
Citrobacter Freundii - growth in sea salt
We urge all iGEM teams to do the same: publish their negative results and failures as well as their successes! This will help everyone interested in their work gain a comprehensive idea of the attempted experiments and their outcomes and could save them time from trying them again. Swallow your pride for the good of science, will you?
