TEAM SPIRIT STUFF HERE - REBECCA TO DO
When 7 UEA undergraduates collide, we come together and have lots and lots of fun. Thanks to this awesome opportunity that iGEM has provided, the last few months have been AMAZING. We worked really hard but we also played hard and we would like to take you through some of our experiences and share the Joy - yes pun intended.
