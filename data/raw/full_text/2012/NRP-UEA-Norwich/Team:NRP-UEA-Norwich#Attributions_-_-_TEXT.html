Overview Step1 Step2
Advisory Team: Dr Matthew Hutchings , Dr. Colwyn Thomas , Dr. Kay Yeomen , Dr Gary Rowley
Amy Congdon has acted as our team artist and has designed our logos as well as helping with the design and production of our video and various pieces of equipment for our human outreach work.
The Biochemical Society were kind enough to provide funding to go towards videos that have proven to be central to the human practices aspect of our project.
Bioline and their representative, Josh Wright, have been extremely supportive in offering us a discount from their catalogued products as well as donating plasmid isolation mini kits, PCR gel clean-up kits and enzymes.
Dr. Paul Thomas for all of his help with imaging mammalian cells, and for providing the SNAP used for producing nitric oxide.
Promega have been extremely supportive in offering us a discount from their catalogued products as well as donating PCR gel clean-up kits and DNA purification mini-preps.
Sebastian Runkel , Anke Arkenberg , Colin Lockwood and Sean McManus are PhD students at the University of East Anglia whose research involve nitric oxide. They gave in-depth presentations on nitric oxide and how to work with it. Dan Tromans is a PhD student based at the UEA and the John Innes Centre in Norwich.
The experience and advice of all of these PhD students has proven invaluable to our own project.
STAR Radio 107.9/1 FM allowed us interview time on their radio show to discuss the iGEM competition, synthetic biology, and the future applications of this branch of science. They gave us a lengthy slot on the show and helped us promote the competition and synthetic biology as a whole.
Dr. Tom Clarke helped us with all of our fluorometer studies, and we are very grateful for him taking the time to teach us how to use the equipment.
The Wellcome Trust kindly provided us with stipends that have allowed the team to work on the project for the ten week period allotted.
The UEA Annual Fund provided us with funds to cover some of the costs assoicated with participating in the iGEM competition. In particular, funds were provided for essential consumables, without which the lab work performed could not have been performed.

UEA Flow Cytometry Services kindly provided us free usage of a flow cytometer and their expertise.
UEA Technical Staff we would like to particularly say a big thank you to all of the support that has been given to us by UEA technicians over the summer, especially at the start of our project when we were all new to independent lab work!
The UEA Enterprise and Engagement Club ,  the School of Biological Sciences at UEA and the John & Pamela Salter Trust Fund were able to provide vital funding towards travel expenses, lab consumables and other necessities for the project.
