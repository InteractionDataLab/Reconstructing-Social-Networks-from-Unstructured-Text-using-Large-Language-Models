Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues in terms of:
1.1 Reseacher Safety
1.1.1 Personal Protective Equipment
1.1.2 Safe work practises
1.2 Public Safety
1.3 Enviornmental Safety
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
3. Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?

Abstract
We aim to express codon-optimized ligand binding domain of Estrogen Receptor α in conjugation with the ToxR DNA binding domain from Vibrio cholerae in E. coli to separate stereoisomers that have profoundly different impacts on biological systems. Isolation and concentration of specific isomers is of immense biological importance to pharmaceutical industries. We plan to try and simplify this process by separating commercially important compounds using a biological system instead of traditional chemical methods which can be very resource intensive and time consuming. We also plan to develop a high-throughput system for screening of drugs which act on the Estrogen receptor using E. coli. Finally, we wish to provide an efficient means for the bioremediation of endocrine disruptors prevalent in the Indian subcontinent which have an adverse impact on the country’s population.
