week 3: 14 may - 20 may
Office work
[Life science symposium]
After the great symposium in Delft, we worked further with the protein prediction program phyre2. We've tried different types of modification to the monomers to see if the monomers will drastically change. Furthermore Thijs and Jasper worked on the web version of the Constructor, a program to optimize the PCR cloning strategy. Mark searched for alternative methods to determine if VLPs are formed.

Lab work
Testing our competent cells
Tuesday:
thawed an E.coli culture of our cryo-stock and transformed with pUC19 vector by electroporation.
Wednesday:
Transformation results
All non-diluted plates overgrown: good quality
Competence: (calculated from 10^4th diluted plates)
MachI   3*10^8
DH5-alpha    1*10^8
Testing CCMV protocol
Wednesday:
Making CCMV cryo-stock (-80°C storage)
500 ul overnight culture
500 ul 30% glycerol stock
Thursday:
CCMV cryo-stock plated
1000x from overnight culture for - 80°C in 30°C
Plated cryo 1 --> for use to check if the storage is working good enough
Friday:
Preparing samples for dialysis following dialysis protocol
Start with dialysis
