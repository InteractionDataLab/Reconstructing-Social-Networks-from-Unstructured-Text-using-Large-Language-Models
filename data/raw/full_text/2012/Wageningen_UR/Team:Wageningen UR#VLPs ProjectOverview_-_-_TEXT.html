VLPs
The Wageningen UR team 2012 will work on the modification of virus-like particles (VLPs) to make them interesting platforms for vaccine production and/or site specific drug delivery. VLPs are empty virus capsids, meaning that they do not contain any viral genome, proteins and epitopes, except for the coat proteins.Three different viruses were selected: Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus, Hepatitis B Virus and Polerovirus. All of them bear much promise for their respective qualities.
Detection of the VLPs will be done using Electron Microscopy (EM) and Dynamic Light Scattering(DLS).
