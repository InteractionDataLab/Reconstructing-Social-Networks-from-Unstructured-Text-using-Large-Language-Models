week 22: 24 September - 30 September
GFP modification
24 September
miniprep of GFP-coil in Bba_J04500, GFP-coil with His tag in Bba_J04500, GFP-coil in pSB1C3 and GFP-coil with His tag in pSB1C3
sending the minipreps to the parts registry
Growing and inducing the GFP-coil in Bba_J04500 as well as the GFP-coil with His tag in Bba_J04500 and induced it with IPTG at an OD of ~0.6
-> no green fluorescence could be seen
