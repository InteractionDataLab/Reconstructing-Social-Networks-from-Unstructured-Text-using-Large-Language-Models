week 8: 18 june - 24 june
Lab work
TuYV
The DNA of our Polero virus finally arrived! It turns out not to be the Potato Leafroll Virus (PLRV), but instead the Turnip Yellows Virus (TuYV) which is a close relative (Polero and TuYV both are from genus Polerovirus and family Luteoviridae).
Friday:
With designed primers, six different constructs were isolated and amplified from TuYV genome, also iGEM prefix and suffix were added to each construct. The six constructs are coat protein of TuYV, coat protein of TuYV with His-tag, Coat protein + 1/2 readthrough, Coat protein + 1/2 readthrough with His-tag, coat protein + readthrough, coat protein + readthrough, later they are named 1,1H,2,2H,3,3H.
