Purification of the VLPs
Reagents & Materials
Reagents:
Reassemblybuffer
Virus buffer
Materials:
Pipettes + Pipettepoints
Eppendorf tubes
Greiner tubes
Centrikon or a similar ultracentrifuge + all additional equipment
Procedure
Cut the knot of the dialysis tubing and empty the content into a clean 50 mL Greiner tube
Prepare a Centrikon T-1055 ultracentrifugation vessel and use a TFT 65.13 rotor, fill the vails with 4 ml of the sample
Gently put 4 mL of a 20% Sucrose in demiwater solution under the 4 mL sample
Balance the vails with reasseblybuffer
Centrifuge at 45000 rpm for 3 h, remember the orientation of the vessel so you know where to look for the pellet
Take a sample from the supernatant (for Western blotting) and decant the rest (supernatant also contains single subunits)
A transparent pellet should be visible
Resuspend/ dissolve the pellet in 200 uL of Virus buffer
