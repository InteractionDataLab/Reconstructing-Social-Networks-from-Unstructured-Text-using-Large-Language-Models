week 0: A new beginning
A short history of team Wageningen UR 2012
During the final weeks of 2011, our supervisors gathered a small group of enthusiastic students, willing to sacrifice their summer holiday to work on iGEM. In the first weeks of January, this small group quickly expanded to about 10 persons who were involved in the brainstorm.
A Belgium Beer Café was deemed most suitable for this purpose. The ideas that came to our minds were everything in between brilliant and alcohol induced nonsense.

Interesting to notice, our final idea is derived from the first idea on our brainstorm list, which can be inspected at the bottom. The Google drive document indicated on September 5, 2012:

During the months February and March, we trimmed the list down to only 3 ideas: - Site specific drug delivery using VLPs - Mimicking eukaryotic glycosylation patterns in prokaryotes - Conversion of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons into usable chemicals After consultation of postdocs and (associate) professors of both Wageningen University and elsewhere, we had a vote which ended in a tie between drug delivery and glycosylation. After a second consultation round and additional information about glycosylation from Prof. Markus Aebi (ETH Zurich), we decided to choose for the site specific drug delivery using VLPs. The final decision was based upon feasibility of the project within the given timeframe. The comment of Aebi was that we are “somewhat ahead of our time”.
The Ideas
A Site specific drug delivery (epithelial cancer)
A Organic sphere lighting
A Ground erosion
A Eating plastics
A Producing oil
