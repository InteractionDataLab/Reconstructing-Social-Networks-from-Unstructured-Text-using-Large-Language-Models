Inside Modification
Since virus-like particles (VLPs) lack genetic content, they enclose an empty space. This space can be filled with proteins such as antibiotics, hormones, and all sorts of pharmaceuticals. Modifications on the inside of the VLPs can increase binding affinity to the loaded substance. The first modifications we pursue is adding the K-coil to the protein subunits at any location that is exposed on the inside of the VLP. The coils will facilitate strong attachment to the substance which is carrying an oppositely charged coil.  The second modification we aim to make is a change in the interior's charge, which is another way to open up more options for loading our VLPs.
