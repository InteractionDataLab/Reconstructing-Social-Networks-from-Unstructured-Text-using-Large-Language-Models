week 4: 21 may - 27 may
office work
This week felt a bit of a slow week. Two of our team members were a day sick. After the great success with the phyre2 program, we searched for a program that uses the output of the phyre2 program to predict the quaternary structure of the VLPs. In other words can a VLP be formed if we apply certain . We found out that there aren't many programs that can accurately predict the quaternary structure and the programs that are available aren't really compatible with phyre2.
Besides getting stuck with the prediction model Mark is investigating further for a new methodology to determine if VLPs were formed. He found two methods that can be used: asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AFFFF) followed  by multi angle light scaterring (MALS) and dynamic light scatering (DLS).
Thijs and Jasper continued further with the development of The Constructor and they hope to have he program ready for bet testing after the weekend

lab work
Testing CCMV protocol
Monday:
Sonification of cells grown last week
specifications: 6 x 30 seconds, output 3-4, amplitude around 20 on ice! cool as much possible, 50 seconds on ice between 30 second steps.
Lysate dissolved in 50 ml disassembly buffer.
Centrifuged at 15000 RPM, 3 minute
Start of dialysis
Tuesday:
Took a negative control for SDS, non induced BL21 E.coli with CCMV wt,
Grown overnight in liquid LB+Kanamycin
Sample transferred to new tube
Stored in -20 degree Celcius
Thursday:
BL21 plated and grown in Greiner tube 10 ml tube
BL21 2 plates freezer
BL21 2 Greiner tubes 30 degree Celcius stove
SDS-PAGE to check for the abundance of CCMV wt capsid proteins
6 different samples
10% SDS gel for proteins of 10 to 100 kDa size
staining for 15 min with Coomassie blue following rinsing with MQ water and 15 min of destaining
