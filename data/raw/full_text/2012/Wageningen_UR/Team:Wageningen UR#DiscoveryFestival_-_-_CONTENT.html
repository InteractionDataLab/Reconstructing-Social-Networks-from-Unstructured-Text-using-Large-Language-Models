This is a festival that is held simultaneously in three cities, and is a meeting point for art, science and music. As part of Discovery’s science program, we will educate people about synthetic biology and even let them experience some of it themselves. The Delft team dropped out at the last moment, but all four other teams made an extra effort to fill the gap and hopefully still make this event into a great success! The festival will be held on the 28th of September and the Wageningen team will go to the festival location in Rotterdam to educate the visitors there. </B><B>To do actual science here, our team contacted a student of Applied Communication Science. For her Msc thesis, she is investigating how scientists communicate about their project with laymen. She will observe us on the Discovery Festival and so, there will be science <A href="https://2012.igem.org/File:Scienception.png" class="external text" rel="nofollow">within</A> our science.</B></P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_festival"> The festival </SPAN></H2><P align="justify">
Discovery is a Dutch festival that, according to its own <A href="http://www.discoveryfestival.nl/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">website</A> (in Dutch), is all about the kick you get when discovering new things. Be it new science, art or music; Discovery tries to excite and stimulate its visitors with new experiences. Synthetic Biology, as an exciting new branch of science, deserves a place here. Together with the iGEM teams of Amsterdam, Eindhoven and Groningen, we will teach synthetic biology to the public and simulate a SynBio Experience. We will do this on all three simultaneous festivals in the cities of Amsterdam, Eindhoven and Rotterdam.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_SynBio_Experience"> The SynBio Experience </SPAN></H3><P align="justify">
The major part of our participation in Discovery is the SynBio Experience. We will build a provisional laboratory on each location, where people may have a taste of what it is like to work on synthetic biology. In just 20 minutes, they will go through a 7 step process of simulated genetic modification and get the opportunity to do all the work themselves. Safety is of course priority, so we will not bring actual GMOs or even <I>Escherichia coli</I> with us. 

In the first step, visitors may visit a specially built offline version of the Parts Registry to choose between several genes encoding colours or smells, to clone into ‘their bacteria’. In the succeeding steps visitors may manually pipet their DNA and bacteria around from one machine to the next, including a vortex, a table-top centrifuge, a make-shift electroporator and an incubator. After the last step, we show them an agar plate with the bacteria they made. These will not actually be GMOs, but they will possess the phenotype that was selected in the first step.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_Poster_Game"> The Poster Game </SPAN></H3><P align="justify">
At the start of the festival, we want to stimulate people to think about synthetic biology and get them interested in us. In order to achieve this, our iGEM team made posters that describe amazing synthetic biology and iGEM projects from the past. We will walk around with these posters to ask people which of these projects they believe are true and which aren’t. We will invite them to our lab, where they may learn that actually all of the projects we describe are true. 
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_Idea-Box"> The Idea-Box </SPAN></H3><P align="justify">
To stimulate people to think about synthetic biology and the wealth of opportunities it gives, we invite them to share their thoughts on camera. Next to our laboratory, we place a video guestbook. Here we will ask people to share what they think would be a good use for synthetic biology. What should next year’s iGEM team make?
</P><H2><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Cooperation"> Cooperation </SPAN></H2><P align="justify">
To make this happen in three different cities on the same night, we cooperated with all Dutch iGEM teams except the team from Delft, which bailed out at the last moment. We divided the tasks, such as getting lab equipment (in threefold) or designing posters, equally amongst the other four teams. Our team will provide several important lab attributes and we designed the posters that will be used. We also divided the locations: The Amsterdam and Groningen teams will attend the Amsterdam festival together, while the Eindhoven team attends the festival in their home city and we will go to Rotterdam.

As an extra addition to the Rotterdam version of the festival, our team will be joined by Paulien Poelarends. She is an Applied Communication Science student at Wageningen UR and for her Msc. Thesis, she researches communication difficulties between scientists and the public. To read a summary of her proposal and a first impression of her data, see <A href="/Team:Wageningen_UR/DiscoveryFestival_Communication" title="Team:Wageningen UR/DiscoveryFestival Communication">Communication Science</A>.

Over 1200 people visited the location in Rotterdam, and over 4000 attended the three festivals combined (based on presale numbers).</B><B>With happy, interested people from all kinds of backgrounds mixed together, the general atmosphere on the festival as well as in our improvised lab was really great!</B></P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Lab_Experience"> Lab Experience </SPAN></H3><P>We prepared a provisional laboratory where small groups of people (3-6) could manually go through a simulation of synthetic biology. In the first step they ‘ordered DNA online’, and through various subsequent steps they learned to use devices like an actual centrifuge, vortex and pipettes, and a make-shift electroporator. In the last step, they experienced the outcome of their endeavours by seeing or smelling the phenotype that they selected for in step one. 
</P><P>Soon after the festival doors opened at 8 p.m., the first group of visitors entered our lab. We took them along on their own synbio trip. Although somewhat uneasy at first, we soon got a hang of how to engage people, spark their interest and make them aware of what they were doing. 
Throughout the evening, our lab has not lacked attention. Our team was giving tours constantly and it was not unusual for visitors to stand in line because our entire team was occupied.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Idea_box"> Idea box </SPAN></H3><P>Over the course of the evening many people left video messages in the idea box, and they all seemed to have a great time while doing it. Unfortunately, we haven’t analyzed the results just yet.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="The_Poster_Game_2"> The Poster Game </SPAN></H3><P>Unfortunately, the overwhelming attention we got for the lab tour meant that we had no time (or need) to walk around with posters and try to spark peoples interest with them. Because of this, the whole poster game never worked out as planned.
However, we did hang A0 sized versions of our posters (attached below, partly in Dutch) on the wall outside our improvised laboratory. Throughout the night, they attracted a lot of attention from the crowd. Apparently, the concepts of synthetic biology and its use as a solution to the world’s problems appeal to a wide audience. We were very happy to observe this.
</P><H3><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Communication_Science_2"> Communication Science </SPAN></H3><P>Unfortunately, it will take Paulien a lot longer to analyze all the data we provided her with and write a solid report about it than we had time to wait. However, she did provide us with a <A href="/Team:Team:Wageningen_UR/DiscoveryFestival_Communication#A_first_impression_of_the_Discovery_Festival" title="Team:Team:Wageningen UR/DiscoveryFestival Communication">first impression</A>. She also said she had a great time observing us and she is very happy with the resulting data.
</P><H1><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion"> Conclusion </SPAN></H1><P>The attention and enthusiasm that we encountered amongst the public exceeded all expectations. Although this overwhelming attention somewhat hindered our ambition to address the festival visitors outside our own lab, it also showed that this wasn’t really required. Overall, we regard our participation in this festival as a great success! 
What’s more: The same is true for the teams that visited the other festivals!
</P><P><I>Attached below are the ‘synthetic biology posters’ that we made. To appeal to a wide audience, we tried to make them as diverse as possible in both style, level of detail and language.</I></P><DIV class="printfooter">
