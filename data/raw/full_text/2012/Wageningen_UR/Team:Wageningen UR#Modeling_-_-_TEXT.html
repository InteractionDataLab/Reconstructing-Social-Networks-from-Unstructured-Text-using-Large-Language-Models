Modeling
Formation of modified Virus-Like Particles is key to the success of our project. Therefore we first predict the structure of the subunits after which we use a model describing the formation of the whole VLPs .
Finally, we wanted to know the applicability of our device. Therefore, we used a human body model which is based on the model made by the Slovenia 2012 iGEM team . We extensively modifyed this model to make it applicable for VLPs, their affinity with diseased tissue, the speed of excretion and degradation and finally, the drug delivery at the targeted tissue.
