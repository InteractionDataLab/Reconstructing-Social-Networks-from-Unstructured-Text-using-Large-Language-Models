Lab work
CCMV Bricking:
Monday:
Check agar plates for colonies
Grow colonies in LB medium + kanamycin, checked optical density
Colonies:
CCMV-1
CCMV-2
d26-CCMV-1
d26-CCMV-2
d26-CCMV-3
overnight in shaker 37 degree Celcius
The monday morning of this week started with a bit of a shock: our plates with our transformed E.coli we're almost completely empty. Luckely there was at least one colony on both of the plates with transformed E.coli containing bricks. We put them in Greiner tubes with LB-medium and a antibiotic and after a few hours checked their optical density. In the afternoon we prepared the samples for a PCR to validate the bricks.
Tuesday:
Checked Greiner tubes
Colonies:
CCMV-1: growth
CCMV-2: no growth
d26-CCMV-1: growth
d26-CCMV-2: growth
d26-CCMV-3: growth
Mini prep the 4 remaining samples
Prepare the mini prep samples for agarose gel
Run the agarose gel (1% w/v agarose)
Check agarose gel
The gel does not look promissing, as the size seems to be bigger than we expected. However, as we are dealing with plasmids, digestion will give the conclusive outcome, with linearized products on a gel. This will be done tomorrow
Wednesday:
Minipreps of the 4 remaining samples is digested by Not1, for half an hour in a FastDigest Green buffer (fermentas)
Digest products are ready to load on an agarose gel without adding loading buffer due to the Green buffer
Run the agarose gel (1% w/v agarose)
The digestion products were not the expected products. We suspect that the linearized backbone pSB1K3 ligated with itself (suffix to suffix, prefix to prefix), as we get a single result arround 2.2k bp. Conclusion: the bricking failed.
Thursday:
CCMV test protocol:
Monday:
Prepared two samples for dialysis according to the dialysis protocol
Change: instead of sonicator for cell lysis, French press was used for one of the samples
We've also made two samples of wt CCMV VLP ready for dialysis. There is only one modification applied in the protocol, instead of using the horrible sonicator, we used the French press, which is a great apparatus and easy to use. In the late afternoon we started with the dialysis.
Tuesday:
Changed the buffer 3 times according to the dialysis protocol
Made an appointment for DLS
Wednesday:
Changed the buffer 3 times according to the dialysis protocol
Thursday:
Stopped dialysis
Prepare samples for ultracentrifuge according to protocol
Run ultracentrifuge, 4 degree Celcius 3 hours
prepare samples for DLS
