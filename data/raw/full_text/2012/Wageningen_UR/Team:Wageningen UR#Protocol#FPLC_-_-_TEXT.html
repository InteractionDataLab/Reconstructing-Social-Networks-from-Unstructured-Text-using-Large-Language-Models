1.2 Washing loop
1.3 Loading sample
1.4 Injecting sample onto the column
1.5 Washing column
FPLC user manual
Every buffer that you put into the FPLC must be filtered and be void of air to optimize the separation.
Washing column
Empty waste bin
Set loop valve on Load Position
Set column valve on designated position
Set on the pressure alarm: 5mPa
Set flow rate on half the maximum the column can handle
Run the FPLC for about 2 times the column volume
Empty waste bin
Washing loop
Set flow rate on 0
Set loop valve on Inject Position
Set column valve on Bypass position
Set on the pressure alarm: 5mPa
Set flow rate on half the maximum the column can handle
Run the FPLC for about 2 times the loop volume
Loading sample
Set flow rate on 0
Set loop valve on Load Position
Inject the sample into the loop with an syringe
Keep the syringe in the machine
Injecting sample onto the column
Set flow rate on 0
Set loop valve on Inject Position
Set column valve on designated position
Set on the pressure alarm: 5mPa
Set flow rate on half the maximum the column can handle
Run the FPLC for about 1 times the loop volume
Turn on the Frac 900, to collect the samples
Washing column
Set flow rate on 0
Empty waste bin
Set loop valve on Load Position
Set column valve on designated position
Set on the pressure alarm: 5mPa
Set flow rate on half the maximum the column can handle
