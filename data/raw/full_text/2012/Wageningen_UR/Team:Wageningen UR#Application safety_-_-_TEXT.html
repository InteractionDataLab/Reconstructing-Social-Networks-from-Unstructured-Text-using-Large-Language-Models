Safety of medical application: A brief literature study
VLPs in the human body
Virus-Like Particles have been successfully used in human therapy, both as vaccines and as medical delivery vessels [1-4]. However, adverse effects such as flu-like symptoms or infusion reactions have also been reported [5].
In our theoretical case-study , we want to use our Hepatitis B VLP. In this year’s review by Yang et. al., the HepB VLP is described as "efficient and safe" [6]. Although the authors focus on its use in vaccines, they also describe how it could vaccinate for other pathogens than the virus it originates from, suggesting that the immune system could be fooled by this particle.
We think that our PnA System may be able to help prevent immune response problems by covering the particle in a stealth coating such as described by Carlisle et. Al. [7]
VLP-encapsulated medicine
Although the majority of literature on medical applications of VLPs focusses on their use as vaccines [1, 2, 8], there are also examples of studies with VLP-encapsulated medicine in humans [3, 4].
In our case-study , we focus on treatment of human colon cancer. Already in 2007, Ramqvist et. al. described the possibilities of treating different cancer variants using VLPs [9].  Today, the most mentioned medicines in the treatment of colon cancer are Irinotecan[10], oxaliplatin[11] and capecitabine [12]. We argue that any medicine can be packaged inside a VLP even if only due to assembly in presence of that medicine, and therefore treatment should be feasible.
