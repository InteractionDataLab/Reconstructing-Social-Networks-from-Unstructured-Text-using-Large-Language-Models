week 13: 23 july - 29 july
Not much work was done this week because the team spent four days on going to a three day synthetic biology conference in Munich. We learned a lot there and had a great time!
Lab work
CCMV
27th July (Hugo)
Another PCR repeat of 18-07's PCR. Purified PCR products using Fermentas PCR Purification Kit then ran another PCR reaction (repeat of 19-07).
28th July (Jeroen)
Digested IPTG inducible promotor with RBS brick: Spe1 and Pst1
Digested CCMV pJET fragment with Xba1 and Pst1
after 30 minutes used a PCR purification for digestion inactivation (Pst1 is not heat inactivatable)
Ligation 1 hour
Transformation of DH5alpha cells
30th July (Jeroen)
5 colonies picked for colony PCR per plate
PLRV
RNA isolation of potato leaf tissue
Reverse transcriptase reaction to obtain cDNA
PCR on cDNA using coat protein primers
The figure below shows the purity of isolated RNA. We isolated RNA of different potato cultivars.
Figure 1: isolated RNA PLRV
Figure 2: ...
We performed Reverse Transciptase reactions followed by PCR. We used the Revert AID H Minus Reverse Transcription Kit (Fermentas).
Figure 3: ...
Agarose gel of PCR products. Lanes 1 till 4 show the PLRV Coat Protein (CP) bands with the expected size of 627 bp. Lanes 6 till 9 show the PLRV Coat Protein plus Read Through part (CP_RT) with the expected size of 2154 bp.
