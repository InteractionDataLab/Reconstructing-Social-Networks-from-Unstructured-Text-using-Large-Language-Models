Growing Culture
Reagents & Materials
For a 100 mL batch:
Reagents:
110 mL of LB
kanamycin
0.5 mL of IPTG stock solution 250 mM
MQ-water
Materials:
Pipettes and pipettes points
500 ml Erlenmeyer
Greiner tubes
Freezer
Centrifuge for Greiner tubes
Procedure
Prepare an Erlenmeyer flask with 0.1 L of LB-medium and keep it at 37°C
Pick E.coli BL21 from a plate and grow them over night in a 10 mL LB culture containing 50mg/L Kanamycin at 37°C
Inoculate the large flask with 1 mL of the overnight culture and grow at 37°C for 2.5h until the OD600 reaches approx. 0.6
Induce with 1.25 mM IPTG (0.5 mL of a 250 mM stock)
Incubate at 37°C for 4 h
Centrifuge the cells in 50ml greiner tubes  at 4700 rpm for 18 minutes
Decant the supernatant and resuspend the pellets in ± 20 mL mQ water each
Centrifuge again at 4700 rpm for 18 minutes
Decant the supernatant and centrifuge for another minute
Pipette any liquid to clear the tube of supernatant
(possible to freeze the cells to -20°C at this point)
Next: Polero dialysis
