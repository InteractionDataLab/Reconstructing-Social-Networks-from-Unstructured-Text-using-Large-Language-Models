Parts we used
For our project, we used few bricks from the 2012 Spring Distribution Kit. A list is included below.
Part
Name
Description
Bba_B0015
Terminator
double terminator (B0010-B0012)
Bba_I13522
pTet GFP
Untagged GFP behind a constitutive promoter.
Bba_J04450
RFP Coding Device
RFP Coding Device (iptg + Cap induced, pSB1C3 backbone)
Bba_J04500
IPTG inducable promotor with RBS
R0010.B0034
Bba_K197021
EILD
One peptide of a heterodimeric leucine zipper that dimerizes with KILR.
Bba_K197022
KILR
A heterodimeric peptide that dimerizes to EILD. This can be used for adhering two cells together to evolve new two cell chemistry and functions.
Bba_K197038
BBb - BseRI/AcuI entry vector
This part is and entry vector in BBb Format. It is flanked by BamHI, BseRI, BglII, and AcuI sites and is used in the 2AB Layered Assembly scheme developed at UC Berkeley.
