SDS-polyacrylamide and native gel electrophoresis
Reagents & Materials
Procedure
Wear gloves
Clean glass slides with MQ and dry
Running gel
Prepare running gel mix in a small beaker for 2 gels:
4 ml MQ
3.3 ml 30% acrylamide mix
2.5 ml 1.5 M TRIS pH 8.8
0.1 ml 10% SDS
0.1 ml 10% ammonium persulphate
Places glass slides in holders and tighten in rack.
polymerization:
Add 4 ul TEMED to the running gel mix, mix and pipet the gel into the slides until the green edge.
Add a layer of iso-propanol on top of the polymerizing gel to equalize.
Stacking gel
When the running gel has fully polymerized, remove the remaing iso-propanol with a tissue
Prepare stacking gel mix in a small beaker for 2 gels:
1.4 ml MQ
0.33 ml 30% acrylamide mix
0.25 ml 1 M TRIS pH 6.8
0.02 ml 10% SDS
0.02 ml 10% ammonium persulphate
Add 2 ul TEMED to the stacking gel mix, mix and pipet the gel onto the running gel.
Place comb
After the stacking gel has fully polymerized, the gels can be stored at 4 degree Celcius in a box with wet tissues.
Sample preparation
Protein denaturation for SDS-PAGE:
Dependent on the protein concentration, typically 15 ul of sample are transferred to a 1.5 ml tube
Pipet 5 ul of SDS-PAGE loading buffer 5X in the caps of the tubes
Spin tubes briefly
Heat samples and a protein marker in a thermobloch 10 minutes at 99  degree Celcius
Spin down samples briefly
Running samples
Place the gels in 1X SDS running buffer and remove combs
Pipet a maximum of 20uL of sample in the slots of the gel using long tips
Connect to power supply and run at 19 mA per gel
When the dye has reached the running gel, power can be increased
Run the samples until the lower green edge
Staining
Rinse gels with MQ and lift the top glass with wedge and cut the edges
Carefully place gels in Coomassie staining solution for 15 minutes
Recover the staining solution with a funnel
Rinse gels with MQ
Place gels in de-staining solution with tissues on each side for 15 minutes
De-stain gel until bands are clearly visible
