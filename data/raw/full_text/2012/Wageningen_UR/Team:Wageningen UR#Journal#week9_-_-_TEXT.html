week 9: 25 june - 1 july
Lab work
General
Cloning of BBa_J04500 (IPTG inducible promotor with RBS) and BBa_K197022/38 (Berkeley KILR coil)
BBa_J04500 was solubilized from the Standard registry parts plate I with 10µl MQ water
BBa_K197022/38 was ordered from the registry
transformation of E.coli with both plasmids
5 samples (due to variation of transformation protocol)
plated on LB-agar with corresponding antibiotic
5 colonies picked per plate and grown in 5 ml liquid LB overnight
subsequent miniprep and digestion check
electrophoresis gel showed the expected bands after 20 min running, unfortunately DNA got bleached later by UV light
3 glycerol stocks (25%) of samples 1,3 and 5 were made to test the protocol for freezing cells at 80°C and subsequent thawing and streaking out, which was done successfully the next day.
TuYV
Wednesday:
Last week's PCR products(1,1H,2,2H,3,3H) were digested, ligated into the linearized pSB1A3 backbone and transformed into our electrocompetent DH5-alpha cells.
Then after transformation, we checked the colonies on the plate, but only few colonies on positive control and sample 1(TuYV coat protein), 1H(TuYV coat protein his-tag) and 2 plate (TuYV coat protein + 1/2 readthrough).
Friday:
Colonies from 1, 1H and 2 plate were picked and checked by colony PCR. But no bands were showed later on the agrose gel check.
