Ti Project
Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a gram-negative soil bacterium that is the causative agent of Crown-Gall disease in both dicotyledon and monocotyledon plants. The tumors caused by Crown-Gall disease contain segments from the Tumor Inducing (Ti) Plasmid known as the TDNA, which completely integrates with the host’s genome. In genetic re-engineering, a binary vector system is used because the Ti plasmid is over 250 kb and is too large to easily manipulate. Binary vectors consist of small plasmids with a cloning site and a selectable maker gene between the left and right border of the TDNA making it easier to manipulate. Modification of a gene of interest and insertion into the Ti Plasmid of A. tumefaciens allows exploitation of the natural ability to A. tumefaciens to transmit DNA. Creation of a binary system containing a gene of interest could potentially be advantageous to both plants and animals.
