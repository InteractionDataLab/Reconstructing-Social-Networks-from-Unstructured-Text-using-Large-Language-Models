During the iGEM competition our team received a lot of help. Therefore we want to thank everybody and especially the following people.
Dr. Michael Bölker
Dr. Michael Bölker is the instructor of our iGEM team Marburg_SYNMIKRO 2012. He was the one to come up with the idea to join iGEM. This was the perfect precondition for beeing a great supervisor and motivator during the whole competition. He provided us with lab space for working on our project and a seminar room for the regular team meetings. We want to thank him for giving us the incredible chance and best conditions for becoming a part of the iGEM family.
Michaela Wehr and Britta Tillmann
Britta and Michaela are PhD students in the research group of Dr. Michael Bölker. Both helped us a lot to get around in the lab. They made us familiar with every detail and secret from 'A' like agarose gels to 'Z' like z(c)entrifuge. Moreover we want to thank them for their constant helpfulness. Furthermore, we are very thankful to Britta for spending a lot of time with us at the microscope and explaining the handling of ImageJ software. Besides her support with the microscopy she was also a great help for us in primer design.
Marisa Piscator
Marisa is the technical assistant in the research group of Dr. Michael Bölker. She helped us a lot to get around in the lab, showed us how to handle with certain lab equipments like the PCR machine and the autoclave. In addition she made us comfortable with the organisation of the laboratorium.
Christian Renicke
Christian is a PhD student in the research group of Dr. Christof Taxis. He is excellently trained in microscopy and helped us to improve visualization of fluorescent proteins in Escherichia coli.

The LOEWE Center for Synthetic Microbiology Marburg (Synmikro) was our main sponsor and financed our project. We are thankful for their sponsoring, because it enabled us the participation on iGEM. Besides the labwork, they made it also possible for us to join interesting events like the CAS Conference on Synthetic Biology in Munich.
Dr. Ilka Weidig
Ilka Weidig was our contact person at Synmikro. She helped us a lot in the organisation of the information day. She provided us with SYNMIKRO flyers and other give-aways.
