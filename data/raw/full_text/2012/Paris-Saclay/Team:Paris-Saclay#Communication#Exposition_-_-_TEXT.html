Exposition
Scientific research is a good thing. However, it is also important to ensure that the public can understand what we are doing.
In fact, if genetic engineering is often the centerpiece in debates, most people don't know what it really is, which can lead to some very serious misconceptions. Because of this, we decided to create an itinerant exhibition consisting of posters on genetic engineering, synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. This exhibition is being made in collaboration with a department of Université Paris-Sud : the Centre de Vulgarisation de la Connaissance (CVC) involved in popular scientific work. The project will be finished and ready for display in November.
Our exhibition is aimed at people with only a small background in biology (such as someone who grasps the concept of a cell without knowing details about DNA). The exhibition will be made of seven static posters:
What is life?
Bacteria
DNA
What is genetic engineering?
Synthetic biology
The iGEM competition
Biohacking and Bio-art
as well as a poster which will describe our team's project.This poster will change every year.
When finished, the exhibition will be displayed in high-schools, libraries, city halls... Or anyplace an organisation of some kind wishes it to be displayed.
