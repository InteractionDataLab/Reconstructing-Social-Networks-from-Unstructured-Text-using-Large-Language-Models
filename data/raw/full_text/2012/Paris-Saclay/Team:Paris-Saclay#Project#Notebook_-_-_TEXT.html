6th august
Sending of the B1 sample to sequencing with two pairs of primers
K-274100 Forward and Reverse
Plasmid pSB1A2 Forward and Reverse
7th august
Liquid culture of B1 in order to prepare a glycerol stock
Receipt of new primers
2 Forward
3 Reverse
Plasmid Reverse
8th august
Amplification of the plasmid pSB1A2, BBa_K274100 and BBa_K115017 by PCR with the new primers. Visualization by electrophoresis on a 2% Agarose gel for BBa_K115017 and a 0.8% Agarose gel for BBa_K274100 and the plasmid pSB1A2. We are expecting a band at 147 bp for BBa_K115017, 3408 bp for BBa_K274100 and 2079 for the plasmid.
9th august
New amplification by PCR of the plasmid pSB1A2, BBa_K274100 and BBa_K115017 as it has been done the day before.
Digestion by EcoRI of the plasmid that contains BBa_K274100.
