Week 4
We placed an order for the primers.
DNA (biobricks) Resuspension using iGEM protocol.
Thermal shock treatment of each biobrick to have a large quantity of DNA.
Staggering of the transformed bacteria on a selective medium to select bacteria which recieved the plasmid.
We started some colonies, one per biobrick, on a liquid culture, in order to make a Miniprep.
Miniprep to purify each biobrick (ready to use).
Groove for two colonies because they did not grow on the liquid culture.
