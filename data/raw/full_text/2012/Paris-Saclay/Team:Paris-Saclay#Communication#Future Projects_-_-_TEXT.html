Projects for the future
As our team was started from scratch this year (this is the first year Université Paris-Sud is participating in the iGEM competition), the creation of the association SyntheBiol, which will be the support of the creation of an yearly iGEM team, as well as searching for sponsors took up a lot of our time. We couldn't follow through with all that we had in mind. Some of our projects revealed themselves too complicated to be completed in a single year. These projects will probably end only next year.
However, synthetic biology is a very rich subject about which many ethical as well as societal debates can take place.
One of our future projects is to interview in 10 to 15 minutes different people playing a role in the field of synthetic biology (scientists as well as non-scientists). We would then compare the different points of view on the subject. One of our goals is to show the diversity of opinions on these controversial subjects, such as the ethical problems posed by synthetic biology.
Simultaneously, we are trying to find an exchange platform, such as a scientific internet forum, with which we could collaborate in order to launch debates on these different questions.
When our contacts are well-etablished, we will try to organize conferences and public debates about synthetic biology in order to improve interactions with the public. We hope to increase discussions and spread knowledge about synthetic biology to people who don't have much experience in the field.
As a matter of fact, we have made contacts in different subdomains of synthetic biology such as bio-art. We don't know where the discussions with these people will lead to but it is possible that new projects emerge from these collaborations.
All of our current and future projects have one goal: to improve public awareness about and knowledge of synthetic biology, as well as contribute to the debates raised by this controversial domain.
