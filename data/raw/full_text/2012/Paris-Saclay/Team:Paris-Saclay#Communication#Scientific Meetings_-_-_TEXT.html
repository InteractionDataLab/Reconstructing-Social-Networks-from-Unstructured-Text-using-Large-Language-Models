Scientific Meetings
Conferences at CREA
As part of our work on synthetic biology, we had the opportunity to attend a day of conferences and debates organized by the CREA (the Centre of Research in Applied Epistemiology).
During this day, synthetic biology was viewed and examined from every perspective. This of course includes the scientific point of view, but it also includes the historical point of view with the topic « historicity and innovation ». Finally, it includes the philosophical and the societal points of view with discussions on the evolution of our perception of  living as well as the future implications of genetic engineering in our life. It was the occasion to talk about movements linked to the problem such as bio-hacking and bio-art.
This day was the occasion for us to realize the richness of synthetic biology. The subject is not limited to the scientific area but also deals with basic questions such as « How can we define life ? », « When can we say that we have created life? »... Our team members and instructors have debated a few of these questions. At no moment have we succeeded in finding a consensus on any answer. This shows the diversity of points of view and opinions raised by synthetic biology.
IGM Days
The laboratory which sponsores us, the IGM, organizes an yearly event called « the IGM Days ». During two days in June, the PhD and the postdoctoral researchs expose their research works. This year we had the opportunity to participate in this event and at the end of the first day we made a presentation of the iGEM competition, our equip and our project. This was the occasion to form tight bonds between our equip and the researchers of the laboratory.
iGEM 2012 PARIS-SACLAY: SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY BY STUDENTS
presented by Jérémie MATHURIN & William FONTANAUD
Introduction to synthetic biology by the participants of the international competition iGEM
(International Genetically Engineered Machine) and presentation of their research project. For the first year, a student team from the University Paris-Sud starts in the iGEM competition.During the summer, they will build a functional biological system in bacteria from pre-existing “biobricks” (developed by previous teams) or created by themselves.
Festival of Science
« The festival of Science » is a national scientific event organized every year in October which goal is to promote sciences with the general public. Many of laboratories are opened this day to offer the opportunity to the public to visit the premises and for researchers to explain what their job is. There is also many exhibitions about different field of Science organized all over the country. Université Paris Sud and IGM are very implicated in this festival, that give us the opportunity to present our team, our project and the iGEM competition.
