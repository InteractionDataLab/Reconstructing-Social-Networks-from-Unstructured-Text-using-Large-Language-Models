Week 5
End of liquid culture (for the grooving colonies).
End of Miniprep : we have usable biobricks.
Culture stocks for each biobrick, to have a reserve of DNA.
PCR to amplify the different biobricks we will need to put together the different fragments using the Gibson Assembly Method.
Electrophoresis gel to verify the length of each biobrick.
Purification of the PCR products when we had the correct length.
