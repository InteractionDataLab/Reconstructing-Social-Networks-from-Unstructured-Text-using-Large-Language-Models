Week 11
13th August
Purification by PCR clean-up of BBa_K115017 treated with DPNI. To visualize the fragment, an electrophoresis has been made with a 2% Agarose gel. We are expecting a band at the size of 123 bp.
New PCR of BBa_K115017 to obtain more quantity of the fragment
PCR program used:
Digestion by DPNI of the BBa_K115017 in order to degrade the matrix plasmid.
Determination of the concentration of plasmid pSB1A2 which has been linearized by HINDIII. We are expecting a band at size (2079+935) ~3kbp
A new PCR of the plasmid pSB1A2 is realized to obtain more quantity of the plasmid. We are expecting a band at size 2079 bp.
PCR program used:
14th August
Determination of the concentration of the BBa_K274100 by electrophoresis on a gel at O.8% Agarose. We are expecting a band at size 2100bp
Digestion of the BBa_K274100 by DPNI to degrade the matrix plasmid.
Stocking up cells with glycerol
PSB1A3Amil CP + Ampicilline
PSB1C3 Amil GFP + Chloramphinicol
15th August
French holiday.
16th August
PCR of BBa_K274100 and visualization by 0.8% Agarose gel electrophoresis. We are expecting a band at 3400bp.
PCR program used:
Digestion of the BBa_K274100 by DPNI to degrade the matrix plasmid.
17th august
Visualization of the DPNI’s digestion of the plasmid pSB1A2 by 0.8% Agarose gel electrophoresis. . We are expecting a band at size 2079 bp.
Miniprep of the pSB1A2 plasmid.
Miniprep of BBa_K274100 and BBa_K115017
Gibson assembly of the B construction
Transformation of DH5α competent cells with the Gibson B construction. The Petri dishes are placed at 37°C.
