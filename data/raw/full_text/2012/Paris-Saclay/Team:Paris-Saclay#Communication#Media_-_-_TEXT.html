Media
Considering the proximity of the Paris-Saclay team lab with media headquarters in Paris, we decided to take advantage of the location to contact media organizations so that we could share our passion with them. This allowed people to learn more about one of the most undefined scientific fields today. The task was less difficult than we thought, as the media quickly showed interest in both the iGEM competition as well as our own project.
Our approach:
We began looking for support from the media at the end of July, as it was crucial for us to describe a project for which we had feedback and results. After a few tries, "Le Parisien", a well-known local newspaper answered our mail proposal and wrote the first article about us. We carried on looking for other media sponsors. "Le Point: Etudiants", "MCE" and "Melty" also showed interest in our project and supported us.
Although it was important for us to succeed in having regional and national visibility, it was also great to be supported by local media such as the Orsay town local journal or even university organizations.
Why the media play an important role:
We think media support is important for an iGEM team. First, the support allows us to present synthetic biology, its importance and its advantages to a public unfamiliar with the concepts. It is hard in France to see synthetic biology and GMOs as a crucial tool for science and not as an unsafe and unhealthy way of increasing food production. Secondly, local and regional communication helps advertise our project to firms and companies based around Paris. Finally, media articles about us give a dynamic image and help us set up a solid base for the Université de Paris Sud team. We sincerely hope this team is the first of many to follow.
MCETV
MCE (“Ma Chaîne Etudiante”) is a French television channel, defining itself as a channel completely dedicated to members of the Y Generation, the 16 to 30 year-olds. MCE presents itself as “an interface between companies, the professional world and students.” Information, orientation and student entertainment are therefore MCETV's three big fundamental themes.
Melty
MeltyNetwork, the website on news, entertainment, fashion and buzz, dedicated to young people. MeltyCampus takes a look at students from the 10 selected campuses, and describes student life in the Paris region. It gives information on institution and world news, as well as cheap deals, hints and tips and job offers. Everything is there to assist students during their schooling. The website's goal is to inform, counsel and help students, as well as entertain them during their education. The meltyCampus website is also intended for 18 to 30 year-olds.

Le Parisien (or Aujourd'hui en France for the national edition) is a French regional daily newspaper. Le Parisien is the most sold daily newspaper in France, selling around 500 000 copies. Thanks to its 10 departmental editions, it also has the largest number of sales of any daily in Paris Le Parisien - Aujourd'hui en France is a large and popular daily, as well as being of general quality. Its simultaneously national and regional nature is its strength and  uniqueness.
