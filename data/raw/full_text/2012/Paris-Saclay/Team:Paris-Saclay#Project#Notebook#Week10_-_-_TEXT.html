Week 10
6th August
Sending of the B1 sample to sequencing with two pairs of primers
K-274100 Forward and Reverse
Plasmid pSB1A2 Forward and Reverse
7th August
Liquid culture of B1 in order to prepare a glycerol stock
Reception of new primers
2 Forward
3 Reverse
Plasmid Reverse
8th August
Amplification of the plasmid pSB1A2, BBa_K274100 and BBa_K115017 by PCR with the new primers. Visualization by electrophoresis on a 2% Agarose gel for BBa_K115017 and a 0.8% Agarose gel for BBa_K274100 and the plasmid pSB1A2. We are expecting a band at 147 bp for BBa_K115017, 3408 bp for BBa_K274100 and 2079 for the plasmid.
PCR program used:
9th August
New amplification by PCR of the plasmid pSB1A2, BBa_K274100 and BBa_K115017 as it has been done the day before.
Digestion by EcoRI of the plasmid that contains BBa_K274100.
10th August
Amplification by PCR of BBa_K274100 already digested by EcoRI. Visualization by electrophoresis on a 0.8% Agarose gel.
PCR program used:
Miniprep of BBa_K274100 followed by Nanovue to determine the concentration of the sample
Miniprep of the Plasmid pSB1A2 followed by Nanovue to determine the concentration of the sample
Digestion by HindIII of the plasmid pSB1A2 in order to linearize it.
Digestion of BBa_K115017 by DPNI to eliminate the plasmid matrix. Visualization by electrophoresis on a 2% Agarose gel. We are expecting a band at 123 bp.
