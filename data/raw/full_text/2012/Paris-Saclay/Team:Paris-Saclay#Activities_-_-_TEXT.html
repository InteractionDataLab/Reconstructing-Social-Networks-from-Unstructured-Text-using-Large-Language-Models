Communication
The Paris-Saclay team decided for its first participation in the iGEM competition to set itself challenging communication goals. Spreading information on our team and on synthetic biology to our university, we used our regional experience to convince national media to interview us several times in order to promote our team. We are proud to say we achieved some crucial objectives, such as efficient advertisement of the iGEM competition in our university. This guarantees the university will participate in the iGEM competition next year. We also succeeded in promoting synthetic biology and our project on a national level.
