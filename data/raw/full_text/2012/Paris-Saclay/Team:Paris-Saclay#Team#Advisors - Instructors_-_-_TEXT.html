Advisors / Instructors
To support the team throughout the competition, the iGEM Paris-Saclay team is supervised by three researchers and two PhD students of the Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie at Orsay.
Our advisors:
Thao Nguyên LE LAM- first year PhD- Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie “I love biology, Nature and exploring life. Combining biology and technology to create products that can be useful for everybody is wonderful. Synthetic biology is exactly what I was looking for! With the Paris-Saclay team, I hope to be able to create freely, explore and conquer new scientific horizons.”
Solenne ITHURBIDE- first year PhD- Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie “I discovered the iGEM competition in 2011 and I immediately adhered to the concept, for the scientific aspect as well as the human one. I’m very happy to participate in the creation of this new team which I am sure will go far in the competition because of its motivation. I also would like to ensure the existence of this team for the coming years, as it seems essential to me that the University Paris-Saclay is represented in this competition.
Our instructors:
Sylvie Lautru, Jean-Luc Pernodet and Philippe Bouloc are CNRS researchers at the Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie in the University Paris-Sud. They share a passion for microbiology. Their expertise covers a wide range of organisms, including the model bacterium Escherichia coli, the antibiotics producer Streptomyces and the pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. Their experimental approaches are both global and mechanistic and their fields of interest are biotechnological and biomedical. They will manage the scientific supervision of the iGEM team Paris-Saclay 2012.
