The team
For the first time, a team has been created at the Université Paris-Sud in order to participate to the iGEM 2012 competition. This team is composed by students coming from a wide diversity of formations and levels. Biologists, chemists and computer scientists have worked together since the end of 2011 to create a durable Paris-Saclay team and to develop an ambitious and interesting project.
