Extracting Pigments
To extract pigments, samples were taken from each culture and centrifuged to pellet the cells. For most experiments a 2ml culture was sufficient and this cell pellet was resuspended in the desired solvent. As seen in our data page, several solvents were tested but our final analysis was done with an ethanol extraction. After addition of the solvent (~300ul) the sample was vortexed and then centrifuged again to remove cell precipitate. The resulting organic phase was used for analysis.
