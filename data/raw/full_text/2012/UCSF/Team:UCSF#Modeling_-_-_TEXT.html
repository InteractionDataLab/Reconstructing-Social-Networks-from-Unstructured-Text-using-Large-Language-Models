Modeling of the Auxotroph System
**A summary of our modeling work is shown on this page and a detailed analysis can be downloaded HERE
Our goal was to understand what parameters allowed for a steady state population ratio and also understand how sensitive the steady state ratio was for each parameter.  In particular we wanted to show that the parameters controlled by the inducer molecules (the alpha parameters) could significantly change the steady state ratio given that the other parameters were within a realistic range.
