Parts Created for the Production of Violacein
BBa_K726016: T7 promoter + VioABE
A device was constructed that contained the three enzymes VioA, VioB, and VioE which were sufficient to produce a green pigment (protodeoxyviolacein)
This is a composite part and more information can be found on the parts registry: VioABE
BBa_K726018:T7 promoter + VioDC
A device was constructed that contained the two enzymes VioD and VioC which on their own do not produce a pigment. However, when cells containing this construct were grown together with strains containing the above construct (VioABE), a purple pigment (violacein) was produced.
This is a composite part and more information can be found on the parts registry: VioDC
