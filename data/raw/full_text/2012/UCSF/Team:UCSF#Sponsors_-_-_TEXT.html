We are very grateful for all supplies/materials that were provided to us over the summer!
- The tyrosine and tryptophan auxotroph strains were provided to us by Alissa Kerner (Lin Lab, University of Michigan).
- A plasmid containing the Violacein operon was provided by the Dueber Lab at UC Berkeley.
- The Lim Lab (UCSF) kindly allowed us to use much of their equipment and provided a lot of feedback on our project!
