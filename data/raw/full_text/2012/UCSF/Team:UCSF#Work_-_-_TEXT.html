Sami Chu and Julia Loi were team leaders for the Auxotroph project and were advised by John Haliburton.
Yesenia Lopez and Louis Tan were team leaders for the quorom sensing project (not shown here) and also contributed to the website design and protocol development.
Jingyi Xi, Kendall Kearns, Verna Huang, and Louis Tan performed all of the computational work and were advised by Graham Heimberg and Ben Heinenke.
Jingyi worked on mathematical analysis computational parameter searching, sensitivity analysis and part of simulation of the auxotroph and toxin-antitoxin system to make both qualitative and quantitative predictions and guidance on experiments. She did only dry lab.
Everyone else contributed to the experiments and wet lab portion of the project.
