Although some specific tasks are listed for each lab member, by the end of the summer each lab member was equally proficient in all lab techniques although each member had their preferences which are outlined below.

Param Sidhu
Param was one of the main driving forces behind lab work. He spent large amounts of time planning the daily schedule, figuring out which restriction digests should be completed, mini-prepping DNA, and cloning plasmids. He also learned to operate the flow cytometer and analyze flow cytometric data. He continued working on the project after the summer ended and the school year began.
Morgan Howell
Morgan was the other main driving force behind lab work. His duties included maintaining the lab notebook, helped to design the wiki, growing yeast, growing bacteria, transforming yeast and bacteria, running gels, and programming the FCAnalyze program which significantly expedited the analysis of flow cytometric data. He continued working on the project after the summer ended and the school year began.
Peter Fan
Peter helped to develop the compuational Tinker Cell Model of the Optogenetic system and also contributed to the lab work through running gels and digests, preparing yeast for flow cytometry, and transforming bacteria. He also participated in more menial tasks such as labeling tubes and making aliquots. Peter also helped implement many of the human practice approaches and worked to maintain the wiki. Regretfully, Peter was unable to continue coming to lab after the school year began but continued helping the team through devising the wiki, human practice approaches, and working on the tinker cell model.
Mentors and Lab
The team is indebted to Buchler Lab and Gersbach Lab for their mentorship. The Principal Investigators and Lab Members served largely as mentors and supervisors. Lab Members trained the team members in a variety of lab techniques and helped provide pointers and tips on ways to enhance DNA yields and document their work to prevent errors.
Tucker Lab of UC Denver
Our work built off of existing work by Chandra Tucker and her lab at UC Denver. The Tucker Lab designed and built the two-hybrid proteins and plasmids that we used in our work.  See the following methods paper for more information about construction and use of these constructs in yeast:
