Gene Synthesis
Generate Oligo's
Go to: http://helixweb.nih.gov/dnaworks/
Set parameters
Enter your job title and email
Choose E.Coli Class II for codon frequency
Set Annealing temperature to 60
Maximize oligo length for cheapest oligo (60 for most companies)
Set Number of solutions = 10
Select Non-degenerate sites to avoid
Bio-Brick requires EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and PstI, others can be chosen if desired
Leave rest of options default
Enter Sequences
Click "Add Sequence Field" twice under Sequence formats
Imput your header sequence (select Nucleotide, this contains your cut sites,spacers, etc for subsequent cloning)
eg. GGATAGGA CATATG
Enter you protein sequence (select protein)
Imput your tail sequence (select Nucleotide, this contains your cut sites,spacers, etc for subsequent cloning)
e.g. CTCGAG ATTCGATG
RUN
If nothing is running make sure there are no blank new lines in your sequence section!
Choose your favorite oligo set to synthesize your gene
Usually look for the best scoring with the closest Tm's and oligo lengths
Design two additional oligos to amplify your gene
A FORWARD and REVERSE oligo that complements your final DNA sequence with a Tm of 65. Just copy from the 5’ end of your first and last oligo from oligo’s reported from DNAWorks until you have a calculated Tm of 65 (20‐30bp, +/‐ 1deg). Try to make sure then ends are either G/C.
ORDER
I often try and order in plates (easier if ordering a lot) and make sure that the nmol of oligo is normalized. For IDT this is free, but that may differ for other companies.
Synthesize Gene
Dilute all oligos to 100uM
Resuspend oligos with water: uLs of water = concentration of oligos (in nm)*10
Mix together
add 5uL of each into a new master tube
Setup Synthesis PCR Reaction (have tried Taq, Vent, and PfuTurbo. Results are always best with Phusion)
1uL Oligo Mix
1uL 25mM dNTP's
10uL Phusion HF Buffer
0.5uL Forward Oligo
0.5uL Reverse Oligo
0.5uL Phusion polymerase
36.5uL diH2O
Synthesis PCR Reaction
98C - 30s
98C - 10s
63C - 10s
72C - 30s/kb target gene
Repeat 2-4 29x
72C - 5min
10C - forever
Setup Amplification PCR Reaction
1uL FROM UNPURIFIED SYNTHESIS REACTION
1uL 25mM dNTP's
10uL Phusion HF Buffer
0.5uL Forward Primer (Tm 65)
0.5uL Reverse Primer (Tm 65)
0.5uL Phusion polymerase
36.5uL diH2O
Amplification PCR Reaction
98C - 30s
98C - 10s
63C - 10s
72C - 30s/kb target gene
Repeat 2-4 29x
72C - 5min
10C - forever
Run a 1% agarose gel of the synthesis and amplification reaction
5uL sample, 1uL loading buffer
You should see a smear from 60bp to over your gene length in the synthesis reaction
In the Amplification reaction a single band with your gene of interest should be there
Continue on with standard cloning!
Make sure to sequence at least 4 clones. Often all 4 will be correct, but insertions,deletions, and spurious mutations sometime occur during the synthesis protocol.
TROUBLESHOOTING
Often I focus on the amplification step, assuming that there is a smear for the synthesis step on the gel and that smear covers the size of your gene of interest.
First I often remove the annealing step use a 2 step protocol (Denature – Amplify x 29)!
Still, if no gene is amplified I run a gradient PCR
Then I try 0.5M Betaine (from 5M stock), or 5% DMSO
Finally if nothing is working I break the gene into chunks and amplify smaller sections, then add those sections together and try to amplify the entire gene from the larger chunks.
