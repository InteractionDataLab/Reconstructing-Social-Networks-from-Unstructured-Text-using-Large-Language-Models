Turbidostat: Ethylene Glycol Assay
Turbidostat Preparation
Created M9 30mM ethylene glycol media
Sterile 200mL of 5X M9 salts
2.8mL of filter sterilized 99.99% ethylene glycol
800mL of sterile double distilled water
Autoclave the closed system of tubing, syringes, culture vessel, and empty bottle
Wrap all open ends of the system with aluminium foil before autoclaving to prevent autoclave water from entering the closed tubing system
Place closed system into the turbidostat apparatus
Carefully and sterilely decant previously made sterile M9 30mM ethylene glycol media into the media bottle
Place the turbidostat into a 37º C incubator
Connect the turbidostat to a computer with the turbidostat software and related libraries installed
Start up turbidostat software program
Be sure to close incubator door to reduce amount of ambient light
Wait till program reads out optical density values - should see "0.000" as first optical density value
Cell Preparation
Culture an overnight of MG1655 transformed with fucO pGA3K3 and aldA pGA1C3 in 2mL of TB with kanamycin and chloramphenicol
Take 1mL from the overnight culture and pipette it into a 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube
Pellet the 1mL aliquot at 4000g for 3 minutes
Pour out the supernatant
Resuspend the pelleted cells with 1mL of sterile PBS
Repeat steps 3-5 two more times
Turbidostat Inoculation and Operation
Take a hypodermic needle attached to a  2.5mL syringe and aspirate 0.5mL of washed cells
Open incubator and through the soft stopper at the top of the culture vessel, inject the cells into the culture vessel to an OD ~0.2
Close incubator door
Wait 12-24 hours
Stop turbidostat program
Retrieve data files from program folder and analyze them using your favorite mathematical software (ie: Matlab or Mathematica )
