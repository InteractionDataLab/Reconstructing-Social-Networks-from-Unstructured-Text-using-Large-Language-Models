Materials Needed
5X isothermal (ISO) reaction buffer (25% PEG-8000, 500 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM DTT, 1 mM each of the 4 dNTPs, and 5 mM NAD). This is prepared as described below.
T5 exonuclease (Epicentre)
Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs)
Taq DNA ligase (New England Biolabs)
Equipment
Heat block or thermocycler with PCR tubes.
Procedure
Prepare 5X ISO buffer. Six ml of this buffer can be prepared by combining the following:
3 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5
150 μl of 2 M MgCl2
60 μl of 100 mM dGTP
60 μl of 100 mM dATP
60 μl of 100 mM dTTP
60 μl of 100 mM dCTP
300 μl of 1 M DTT
1.5 g PEG-8000
300 μl of 100 mM NAD
Add water to 6 ml
Aliquot 100 μl and store at -20 °C
Prepare an assembly master mixture. This can be prepared by combining the following:
320 μl 5X ISO buffer
0.64 μl of 10 U/ μl T5 exo
20 μl of 2 U/μl Phusion pol
160 μl of 40 U/μl Taq lig
Add water to 1.2 ml
Aliquot 15 μl and store at -20 °C. This assembly mixture can be stored at -20 °C for at least one year. The enzymes remain active following at least 10 freeze-thaw cycles.
This is ideal for the assembly of DNA molecules with 20-150 bp overlaps. For DNA molecules overlapping by larger than 150 bp, prepare the assembly mixture by using 3.2 μl of 10 U/ μl T5 exo.
Thaw a 15 μl assembly mixture aliquot and keep on ice until ready to be used.
Add 5 μl of DNA to be assembled to the master mixture. The DNA should be in equimolar amounts. Use 10-100 ng of each ~6 kb DNA fragment. For larger DNA segments, increasingly proportionate amounts of DNA should be added (e.g. 250 ng of each 150 kb DNA segment).
Incubate at 50 °C for 15 to 60 min (60 min is optimal).
If cloning is desired, electroporate 1 μl of the assembly reaction into 30 μl electrocompetent E. coli.
