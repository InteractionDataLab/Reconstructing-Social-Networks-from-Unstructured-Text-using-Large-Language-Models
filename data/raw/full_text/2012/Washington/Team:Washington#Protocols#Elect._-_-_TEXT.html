Electroporation Protocol
Obtain a competent cell aliquot from the -80oC freezer, keep the tubes on ice.
Add 40μL of ice cold H2O to each  aliquot to make a 80 μL solution.
Separate the  80 uL solution into 2 separate tubes  to make two 40uL tubes of solution.
Add 1μL of a Gibson Product into each tube
Using the Electroporator:
Set the electroporator to 1250 V. and press "time constant".
Obtain a chilled cuvette, and pipet all 40 uL of a sample into the center.
Place the cuvette into the electroporator and press "Pluse" twice.
Immediately remove the cuvette and rescue the sample in 300-500 mL of LB.
Pipet the sample into a labeled microcentrifuge tube, and record the time constant. (The time constant should have a value greater than 2.5).
Repeat this process for the other sample. After the addition of LB, transfer the sample into another labeled microcentrifuge tube.
Incubate both samples for ~1 hour @ 37oC.
After incubation, combine both samples (make sure each sample has a comparable time constant) and follow standard plating procedures.
