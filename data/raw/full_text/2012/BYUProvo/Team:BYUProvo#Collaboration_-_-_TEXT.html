We provided some modeling assistance to the Missouri Miner's iGEM team. They have a fascinating project dealing with increasing enzyme efficiency. In particular, they are working on a method to attach specified enzymes to the surface of E. coli in order to increase the efficiency of chemical reactions that require a pathway. Our modeling helped to describe how the sort of improvement in efficiency that they may expect.

We also participated in two surveys sent out by other iGEM teams. The teams were:
Part Characterization: Ciencias_UNAM team.
