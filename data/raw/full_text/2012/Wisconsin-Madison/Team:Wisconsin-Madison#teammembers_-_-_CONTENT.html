He is interested in studying the many different ways synthetic biology can be used to help the world, from medical applications to biofuels. When Charlie is not in the lab he wants follow in his family's footsteps by helping those less fortunate than him. His older brother and grandmother dedicated their lives to teaching in the inner city of Chicago, while his parents have been representing people who could not afford lawyers for 30 plus years. His younger brother works in a group home helping abused and neglected children find a safe place to live and learn.

He did in-silico <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Wisconsin-Madison/modeling">modeling and optimization</A> of the Limonene production pathway in E.Coli. He also had a great time in the wet lab with the team. He finds excitement in analyzing the way biological systems work. The robustness and precision of decision control and processes in nature is fascinating. He see’s possibilities in re-engineering such systems or applying the underlying fundamentals to solve scientific challenges in the future, which sums up the background on which he targets post-graduation studies.
