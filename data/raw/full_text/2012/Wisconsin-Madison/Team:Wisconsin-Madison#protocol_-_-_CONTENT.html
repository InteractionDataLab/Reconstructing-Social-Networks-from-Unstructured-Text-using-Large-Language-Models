<H2>Protocol</H2><UL>1. Pellet the overnight cultures in a 1.5ml eppendorf tube for 1 min. Spin down 4 to 4.5 ml of culture. (For low copy spin down about 6 ml.</UL><UL>2. Resuspend each pellet in 200ul of Alkaline Lysis Sol I, RnaseA added (final RNaseA concentration should be 100ug/ml) Make sure there are no lumps, homogenized.</UL><UL>3. Add 400ul Alkaline Lysis Sol II. Invert 4-6 times to mix. Do not allow reaction to lyse for more than 5min. Sample should clarify.</UL><UL>4. Add 300ul Alkaline Lysis Sol III. Invert 4-6 times to mix. Sample should have a white precipitate.</UL><UL>5. Add 100ul of chloroform. Do this in a fume hood. Invert 4-6 times to mix.</UL><UL>6. Rest on ice for 5-10min. This step is so that the chloroform does not get too hot in the centrifuges and leak out of the tubes. If you want to skip this step you might consider using less cholorform. I put the tubes at -20 for a couple of minutes.</UL><UL>7. Centrifuge at max. speed (14,000rpm) for 10min.</UL><UL>8. Pipet 750ul of supernatant/aqueous layer into a fresh tube. I do up to 800ul.</UL><UL>9. Add 1/10 volume (75ul) 3M NaOAc, pH 5.2. Flick to mix. 80ul if have 800ul of supernatant.</UL><UL>10. Add 0.7-1.0 volume COLD isopronanol (in freezer). Vortex/Flick to mix. If in a hurry go straight to step 11, otherwise rest on ice for 10-30minutes. I have even let it precipitate overnight at 4C if convenient. 600ul isopropanol. Then I put it at -20C for 5minuetes up to over the weekend if needed.</UL><UL>11. Centrifudge at max. speed for 25min. Most miniprep protocols say to do this at 4C, but I have not noticed decreased yield by centrifuging at room temp.</UL><UL>12. Remove and discard the supernatant. Don’t disturb the pellet. Sometimes I can’t see a pellet and more often than not I still have DNA.</UL><UL>13. Add 1ml of 70% EtOH (at room temp.) Invert 4-6 times to rinse the tube.</UL><UL>14. Centrifuge at max speed for ~5 minutes. Room temp. is fine. Remove and discard the EtOH.</UL><UL>15. Repeat steps 14 and 15 to remove all traces of isopropanol. Pulse spin after removing bulk of final EtOH wash and pipet off remaining EtOH.</UL><UL>16. Air dry the pellet for ~15min (pellet will change from white to clear as it dries). Resuspend desired volume (~30ul) of H2O or EB or T10E1 depending on downstream applications. If you pipet off the EtOH well, then I have done this for as little as 2 min. For fosmids, I usually resuspend the pellet in 20ul water.</UL><H1>Colony PCR</H1>
Colony PCR is an efficient way to screen for the construct with the desired insert. Colony PCR uses primers that attaches on the outside of the cloning site and amplify only the cloning region.<STRONG style="font-style:italic;">Master Mix</STRONG>

This is for 10ul reactions. The volume below is for one 10ul reaction. If doing more than one, multiply the amount by how many colonies you will be screening, and probably add one extra reaction worth to account for pipetting error.

*BSA should only be added if needed. Check the NEB poster on the -80 to see if it is needed.

Incubate for 1 hour in the 37 degree water bath

Notes:

Keep everything on ice when thawing and mixing reagents. Do Not vortex the master mix; you can gently bump it with your fingers and then spin it down for less than 10 seconds.

If your DNA [ ] is lower and your volume will exceed 20uL, scale up the amounts of B4 Buffer and BSA to 3uL each and make a 30uL total volume reaction.

IMPORTANT: Enzymes must be kept in the blue cold box.<H1>Dishwashing protocol</H1><UL>1. Bleach / wait / remove stickers</UL><UL>2. Pour down drain</UL><UL>3.

Use the electro-competent cells you just made for transformation.
ALL OF THIS IS ON ICE

    <UL>1. 100uL electrocompetent cell aliquots and UV sterilized cuvettes should already be in an ice bucket. (UV means 3 mins in the gel doc on full)</UL><UL>2. Label 13mm plastic test tubes beforehand, have 900uL of LB ready to pipette into the cuvette immediately after shocking</UL><UL>3. Set electroporator machine to bacteria</UL><UL>4.  If plasmid DNA is ~150 ng/uL use 2.5uL. If 200 ng/uL, use 2uL (~400ng) into 100uL aliquots of electocomp cells</UL><UL>5. Use a kimwipe to wipe off any condensation from the exterior of the cuvette - important!!</UL><UL>6. Place the cuvette in the holder in the right orientation, slide in until you hear the click. The two electrodes should touch the sides of the cuvette</UL><UL>7. Take up 900uL of LB into the pipette tip</UL><UL>8. Press the SHOCK BUTTON</UL><UL>9. Immediately, pull out the cuvette and add the 900uL LB directly to the slit inside</UL><UL>10. Pipette up and down twice very gently. Transfer to the labelled 13mm tube (Don't make bubbles)</UL><UL>11. Repeat for all samples, INCLUDING YOUR NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE CONTROLS</UL><UL>12. The time constant reading should be between 3.8 and 5 ms (If it arcs, it is not usable)</UL><UL>13. Incubate in the gentle shaker (37 degrees and 100rpm) for 1 hour</UL><UL>14. Plate 100uL aliquots onto appropriate media, leave the remaining 800uL in the tubes to sit on the bench top overnight</UL><UL>15. For more difficult transformations, pellet 700uL of the culture, pour off supernatant and re-suspend pellet in 100uL of LB. Plate the concentrated 100uL of transformation.</UL><UL>16. To the remaining 200uL of transformation, add 1mL of LB and let sit on bench top overnight</UL><UL>17. Incubate all plates in 37oC incubator overnight, inspect for colonies in morning.</UL><H1>Ethanol Precipitation</H1><UL>1. 1/10 volume of Sodium Acetate (3 M, pH 5.2).</UL><UL>2. Add 2.5-3.0 X volume (calculated after addition of sodium acetate) of at least 95% (ice-cold) ethanol.</UL><UL>3. Incubate on ice for 15-30 minutes. In case of small DNA fragments (&lt;100bp) or high dilutions overnight incubation gives best results, incubation below 0 °C does not significantly improve efficiency.</UL><UL>4. Centrifuge at &gt; 14,000 x g (max speed) for 10 minutes at room temperature or 0 °C.</UL><UL>5. Remove supernatant being careful not to disturb the DNA pellet, which may be invisible. Remove any drops of liquid that adhere to the walls of the tube. (It is best to save the supernatant from valuable DNA samples until recovery of the precipitated DNA has been verified). </UL><UL>6. Fill tube 1/2 way with 70% Ethanol to rinse and recentrifuge at maximum speed for 2 minutes.</UL><UL>7. Repeat step 5.</UL><UL>8. If necessary, store the open tube on the bench at room temperature just until the last traces of fluid have evaporated.</UL><UL>9. Dissolve pellet (which is often invisible) in desired volume of buffer. (Usually TE [pH between 7.6 and 8.0], or water)</UL>
NOTE: Make sure to rinse the wall of the tube well with the buffer since up to 50% of the DNA will have been smeared on the wall. This can be done by pushing a bead of fluid over the surface of the wall using a disposable pipette tip.

<H1>Freezer stock preparation</H1><H3>Freezer Stocks</H3>

750ul of culture
250ul of 60% Glycerol Filter Sterilized using equipment in the Pfleger Lab
Store them in -80C

Combine in labelled (strain, date, initials) cryotube (lids &amp; tubes in separate blue boxes on center of benches)
<H1>Gel extraction</H1>

If you are planning on extracting more than 2 fragments, make sure you add a ladder to the left of each well in order to split up the gel when you excise the band. This will lower the time for UV exposure.

   <UL> 1. Make a 1% gel, except increase the weight to 0.3g of agarose and 30mL of 1X TAE, and the 8 welled comb.</UL><UL> 2. Pre-Weigh a micro-centrifuge tube for later use</UL><UL> 3. To load a 30uL digestion, add 6uL of 6X Loading Dye to the digestion tube</UL><UL> 4. Also load 1uL of dyed uncut DNA into another row (as the control), and 2Log Ladder into a third row to compare band sizes and to confirm the DNA has been digested correctly.</UL><UL> 5. Run the gel at 100V for 30min (unless the gel bands are extremely close in size</UL><UL>  6. Put up the UV shield on the gel imager, and find some gloves</UL><UL> 7. During extraction, use the Prep UV setting on the gel imager so the UV isn’t as strong</UL><UL> 8. Also you need to cut out (excise) the band very quickly (~5 sec)</UL><UL>  9. Then take a picture of the rest of the gel to record the excised band</UL>

Note: The picture is taken after excision to reduce the amount of exposure time to the DNA. Too much exposure (~1min) will potentially cause thiamine dimmers and other mutations in your DNA.

After this proceed using the direction found in the gel purification/extraction kit. Finally, elute in 25 uL of water.

Nat Sternberg, among others, pioneered the use of phage P1 to move genetic elements in E. coli and the use of the Cre/Lox system from P1 for controlled recombination. Today, phage P1 is commonly used as a transducing agent because it is a generalized tranducer (it can package random sections of the host chromosome instead of its own genome) giving rise to &quot;transducing particles&quot;. P1vir is a mutant phage that enters the lytic cycle upon infection (ensuring replication and lysis). During the replication and lysis of the phage in a culture of bacteria, a small percentage of the phage particles will contain a genome segment that contains your gene of interest. P1 packages approximately 90 kb of DNA, so you can transduce genes that are linked to a selectable marker.</UL><LI>Once a phage population has been generated from a donor host, the phage are used to infect a recipient host. Most of the bacteria are lysed by phage that packaged P1 genomes, but a fraction of the phage inject a genome segment derived from the donor host. Homologous recombination then allows the incoming genomic segment to replace the existing homolgous segment. The infected recipient bacteria are plated on a medium that selects for the genome segment of the donor bacteria (antibiotic resistance, prototrophy, etc.</LI><LI>All of this would not work if the infectivity of the phage could not be controlled. Otherwise, phage released from neighboring cells would infect and lyse the bacteria that had been infected with transducing particles. Someone really smart discovered that phage P1 requires calcium for infectivity. Therefore, you can control P1 infectivity by growing in the presence and absence of calcium.

Forward primer is the same as sequence and reverse primer is reverse complement of same sequence on other side of gene. For adding restriction cut sites, make sure they are in the 5’-3’ orientation for both the forward and the reverse. For example, in the reverse primer the cut sites should be (PstI) 5’-CTGCAG-3’ and not 3’-GACGTC- 5’. Below is an example of a desired gene. For the Forward primer, try and have the primer sequence be the sequence including the end part of the gene, so you don’t have too much of the junk DNA after the gene included as your insert part.</UL><UL>5’-TTTTCCTGGAATA[Beginning of gene] TTATCAGGGGGAGCCGTTGACCGTCGACGCGCGCAGCGTCGGACACAAT….….ATGAACAAAAACAGAGGGTTAACGCCTCTGGCGGTCGTTCTGATG -3’

The label (and paperwork which comes with the primer) reports the amount of DNA in the tube in nanomoles at the bottom right, and is usually in the range of 20 to 30. To this blue-capped tube, add 10 uL of (ideally nuclease-free) water for every nanomole of DNA (for example, 22.7 nm of DNA would get 227 uL water). Put the tube in the 50 degree water bath for 30 minutes to dissolve the DNA in the water. This is now your primer stock.</UL><H3>Aliquoting primers for use</H3><UL>Before using the primers in a PCR reaction, you need to make 10x dilutions. The volume's not terribly important, but in the past aliquots of 50 uL usually start causing problems (non-specific amplification, etc.) before they run out. 20 uL aliquots seem to be good (2 uL of your primer stock, 18 uL water).</UL><H3>What's the concentration?</H3><UL>Following the above protocol, the primer stock is 100 uM and the aliquots are 10 uM.

    <LI>Phusion reactions are supposed to be run at 500 nM (.5 uM) primer concentration, so 1/20 of the reaction volume should be each primer (2.5 uL of the aliquot per 50 uL Phusion reaction)</LI><LI>GoTaq reactions can be run with primers between 0.1-1.0 uM, so anywhere from 1 to 10% of the reaction volume should be each primer.</LI></UL><H1>Viability Test for Toxicity Analysis of Bacterial Cultures</H1><H3>Toxicity Testing Protocol</H3><UL>The night before, start 5 mL cultures of the strains to be tested (MG1655, DH1, etc.). The following morning, aliquot 25 mL of medium (whichever type you like, I normally just use LB) into
an appropriate number of 250 mL baffled shake flasks.</UL><H3>Growing the Cultures</H3><UL>1. Take the OD600 of the overnights.</UL><UL>2. Inoculate cultures to an OD600 of .01 using the following
formula: You're probably familiar with this formula from general chemistry. Because the OD600 is proportional to the concentration (as long as we are within the linear range of the spectrophotometer) of cells in a culture, we may treat OD600 as a concentration. The reason for doing this is to inoculate each culture with approximately the same number of cells so that no
culture has a growth advantage from having a larger inoculum. For example, say we took the OD600 of an overnight of E. coli and found it to be 5.11. If we let V2 in the above equation be the volume of overnight we want to add to 25 mL of LB to achieve an OD600 of .01 in 25 mL of medium, then solving for V2 we get: So to inoculate the 25 mL culture we would need to add 49 μL
of the overnight. Note the volume of the new culture is not
exactly 25 mL, it's actually closer to 25.049 mL. In the above
calculation we have neglected the volume added (this is a very
good approximation).</UL><UL>3. Add the appropriate amount of solvent to each shake flask. It
is normally advisable to have a no-solvent control. When dealing
with solvents that are sparingly soluble in water, I like to
measure &quot;concentration&quot; in terms of volume of solvent added
per volume of culture (for example, 10 μL of R-Limonene per mL
of culture, which just means that I added 10 μL of solvent for
every 1 mL of culture that was originally present). This is more
correct because using volume % and molarity assumes you have a
single-phase system - you frequently will not (it is preferable
to use molarity if you have a single phase system)</UL><UL>4. Incubate for 24 hours at 37°C with shaking (250 RPM). This works for E. coli - if you ever use another microorganism you will likely have to change how you incubate your cultures.
5. After 24 hours, remove the cultures from the incubator. If there is an organic layer present (i.e. if you are working above the solubility limit of your solvent), allow the cultures to
settle for approximately 30 minutes (depending on the solvent more or less time may be needed).</UL><H3>Viability Testing</H3><UL>1. Set up Eppendorf tubes with 900 μL of PBS (phosphate buffered
saline) in each. You will need 6 tubes per culture. Position
each set of six tubes in a line.</UL><UL>2. Pipette 100 μL from the aqueous phase of each culture into
the first tube in the corresponding series of 6 tubes. Be sure
to label the first tube in each series appropriately!</UL><UL>3. The first tube in each series is diluted 10 times from the
original culture. Vortex this tube and add 100 μL of this
suspension to the next tube in the line (this will be diluted
100 times from the original culture). Continue until you have
diluted the culture 106 times, vortexing the suspension before
diluting it.</UL><UL>4. Repeat step 3 for each set of 6 tubes.</UL><UL>5. Spot 3 μL of each 104, 105, and 106 dilution onto an LB agar
plate.</UL><UL>6. Incubate the plates overnight at 37°C (~14 hours is
sufficient). Because the plates are likely still wet, make sure
not to turn them up-side down.</UL><UL>7. Remove and image the plates the following morning.</UL><UL>If you do not have an emulsion of solvent you may just take the OD600 like you normally would. Withdraw the appropriate volume from the aqueous phase and dilute it (if necessary), then take
the OD600. If you do have an emulsion, you will need to wash your cells before taking an OD600 measurement, as the presence of solvent bubbles will greatly inflate your OD600 measurement.</UL><UL>1. Aliquot 1.5 mL of the aqueous phase of each culture into
Eppendorf tubes.</UL><UL>2. Centrifuge tubes for 10 minutes at 5000xg. Some samples may
have essentially no cells (no cell pellet). You can just ignore
those samples and not bother washing them.</UL><UL>3. Decant the liquid from each sample.</UL><UL>4. Resuspend in 1.5 mL of PBS.</UL><UL>5. Repeat steps 2-4 two more times.</UL><UL>6. Using PBS as a blank, take the OD600 of each sample. It may be necessary to dilute some samples 1:10.</UL><UL>If you want you can also take the OD600 directly from the aqueous phase of each culture. Some samples will show that they have a significant OD600 when the only thing present is bubbles
of solvent. It is normally a good idea to do this for cultures that give no cell pellet while washing the cells. If this is the case you will know from your viability data, as nothing will have grown.</UL><H1>Washing Beads</H1><UL>1. Pour beads into a flask.</UL><UL>2. Add warm water, Alconox and bleach to flask, cap it.</UL><UL>3. Place in shaker overnight.</UL><UL>4. The next morning, dump out the wash solution and rinse<STRONG> repeatedly </STRONG>with deionized H20 until water is completely clear and no soapy bubbles remain.</UL><UL>5. Dump out all remaining water.</UL><UL>6. Ideally - you would place the beads in an oven to dry at this step, but we don't have an oven so don't worry about it.</UL><UL>7. Dispense the beads into desired jar/ container.</UL><UL>8. Autoclave - run the longest possible gravity dry cycle.</UL></DIV></DIV></CENTER></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
