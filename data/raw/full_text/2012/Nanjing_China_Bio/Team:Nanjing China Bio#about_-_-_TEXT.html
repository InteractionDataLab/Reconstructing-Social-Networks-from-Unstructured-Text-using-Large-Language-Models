Our Team
Our team is composed of 15 undergraduates, 1 postgraduate, and 4 guide teachers. We built this team based on our common interest in iGEM and synthetic biology. We have a diverse background with students from School of Life Science, School of Computer Science and School of Journalism and Communication. This is the first year for our university to take part in iGEM competition, and we would like to compete with other teams from other famous universities, share happiness and reap friendship.
