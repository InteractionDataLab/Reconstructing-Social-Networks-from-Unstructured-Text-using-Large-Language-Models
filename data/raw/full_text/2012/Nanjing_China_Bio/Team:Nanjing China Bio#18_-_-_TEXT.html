Yuheng Han Home > member
I am a senior student from the School of Life Science,Nanjing University, and my name is Yuheng Han. I think life science has the greatest research potential and the most hope for breakthroughs, so I want to be a researcher in this field. I'm very happy to join iGEM,the global competition in life science. In the competition I can exercise my research abilities. Out of laboratory, I am a sanguine person. I like reading books and playing computer games. After all, moderate entertainment helps to work better.
