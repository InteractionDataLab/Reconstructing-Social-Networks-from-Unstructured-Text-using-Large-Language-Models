7.05(B)
This is our first regular meeting after the final exam. Considering some teammates have gone home, we simply concluded our work before and afterwards. 
After analyzing many documents about Salmonella, we decided to start with improveing the character of facultative anaerobic of the bacteria to enhance its property of tumor targeting. 
From the documents, we realized that the reason why some bacteria are highly anaerobic is related to anaerobic promoters.  The most used anaerobic promoter applied in experiments to express the target genes at present is promoter nir B.  However, we found other anaerobic promoters had few differences from Pnir B based on the data.  Therefore we supposed there might be better anaerobic promoters than Pnir B in terms of expressing specific target genes, and set our next goal to find newer and better anaerobic promoters.  
In order to realize this goal, we start with reading the following documents that might bring us some illumination.

7.14（B）
After all the hard work of reading documents, we searched out the following anaerobic promoters that might be better than Promoter nir B: Nark, fdeF, J6 oxygen promoter, puc promoter, VHb promoter, mNark, phTERT, and pfdhF.  We hope to identify through experiments whether the property of these promoters is better than Promoter nir B when pressing the target gene we need as we expected.  
Meanwhile, we found some anaerobic promoters that we think could be capable of our requirements from the iGEM official website: K239005, K239011, K376006, J61043, K283025, K376003(A), K227007, K258005, K239006, K404106, K387009, K387003, K376003(C), and K376004.  We hope we could testify all these promoters after we received the plat from iGEM.

7.15(A)
Recently we failed to knock out the relevant genes of VNP20009

The final of concentration of arabinose we used was from 10mMol to 100mMol and the inducible time was from 1 to 4 hours. However we didn't get the mutants in salmonella.

Recently we read an article Use of the lambda Red recombinase system to produce recombinant prophages carrying antibiotic resistance genes, in this article the writer used several ways to improve efficacy of recombinant, 
First we should check the helper plasmid pKD46 in the first step of the method. Secondly LB agar plates containing kn were used as selective media. Initially we used 50g/ml kn. however this paper recommend that we use lower antibiotic concentrations in the selective media. Once plated, 24 hours of incubation were enough to visualize colonies. The colonies were then transferred to new LB agar plates with higher antibiotic concentrations (kn: 50μg/ml).

7.18(B)

After several days of consideration, we began to draw out our experiment plan.

Considering that the plat from iGEM and the bacteria strains and enzymes we need are not in readiness, we decided to start with the basic experiments of PCR, extraction of plasmids and recycle of plasmids.  In the following days, we will perform the following experiments as practice.  

1. Extraction of plasmids.

2. PCR.

3. DNA agarose gel electrophoresis.

4. DNA restriction endonuclease reaction.

5. Recycle of DNA.

As most of us are from the School of Life Science and have already had the experience of these experiments, we expect we would have a good start and get into the best condition soon.

7.30(B)

After 10 days of pre-experiments, we decided to start our experiments officially tomorrow.  We have basically determined our project.  Firstly, we hope to extract the plasmids from the bacteria strains from iGEM that might contain anaerobic promoters we want.  And for the plasmids we searched out from documents, we decided to get them through PCR.  Secondly is specific enzyme digestion at EX or SP site.  Following is adding report genes into EX or SP site.  The final step is to transfer the plasmids into VNP through electric transformation and cultivate the bacteria anaerobically.  Then examine the expression intensity of report genes to determine the property of the anaerobic promoters and to find out the best one.
