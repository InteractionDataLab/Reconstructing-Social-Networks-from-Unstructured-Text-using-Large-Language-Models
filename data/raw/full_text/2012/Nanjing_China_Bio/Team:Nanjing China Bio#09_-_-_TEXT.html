My name is Bomiao Hu, a junior student from the School of Life Science, Nanjing University.  I participated in the Kuang Yaming's Honor Elite Program and hoped to learn more about basic scientific researches.  Others may complain about the boredom of researches because of doing the same thing day by day.  But I do not regard this intolerable because every attempt to verify our thoughts is to approach the truth of nature, although these experiments are carried out with similar procedures.  So I like doing experiments and will do it for a relatively long time.
