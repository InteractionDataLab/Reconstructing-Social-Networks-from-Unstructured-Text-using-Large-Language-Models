I'm currently in my third year in the School of Life Science, and this is my first time to take part in the iGEM competition.  It's a precious opportunity for me to apply all the knowledge I have learned to the actual researches.  Although I didn't help in the experiments, I still made my efforts in gathering the information our team needed by studying the documents concerning our topic, as well as all the translation work.  Outside of academics, I enjoy playing basketball, watching movies and traveling.  We had a lot of fun working with each other this summer.
