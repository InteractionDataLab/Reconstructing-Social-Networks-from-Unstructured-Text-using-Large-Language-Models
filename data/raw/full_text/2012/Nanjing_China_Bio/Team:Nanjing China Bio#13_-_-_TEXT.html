Jiren Luo Home > member
I'm Jiren Luo. I study biotechnology in the department of Life Science at Nanjing University. My scientific interests include all respects of molecular biology and Immunology. In our project, I'm responsible for bioinformatics work and participate in the experiment as well.
Apart from my duties, I have many hobbies. I l enjoy listening to music in my spare time, better with a cup of coffee. I like traveling everywhere and appreciating the beautiful scenery all around my motherland. I also take great interest in Chinese chess. Sometimes I'd like to play this traditional Chinese game on the internet. What else can I say? I am an optimist. o(∩_∩)o
