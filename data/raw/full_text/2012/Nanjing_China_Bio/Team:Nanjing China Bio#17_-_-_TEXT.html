I am Xinzhu Luo, a junior student majoring in Life Science in Nanjing University. Thanks to my predecessors, I had this precious chance to join our iGEM team and helped to finish those experiments. Although I've made mistakes in the experiments, it really made me proud that I finally got the results I wanted. Through this unique experience, I indeed learned a lot about synthetic biology and enhanced my skills in the lab. Most importantly, I became confident about my further study in biology. I am so happy to have this chance to work with these wonderful and intelligent teammates.
