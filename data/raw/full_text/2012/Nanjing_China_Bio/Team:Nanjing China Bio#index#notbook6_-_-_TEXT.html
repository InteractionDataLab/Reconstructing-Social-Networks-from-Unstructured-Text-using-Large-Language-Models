6.1(all)
This weekend, we had our third regular meeting, and had a new teammate joining in us.  Jiren firstly further explained to us the conceptions we didn't figure out last week.  Chao, our team leader, introduced the fundamental knowledge about cancer therapies and the background of the review, combining with his own experience in previous experiments.  He also presented the weakness of the anti-cancer drugs nowadays, and the orientation scientists are working towards, which made us have a deep understanding of our project.
Afterwards, Anqi, Xianwei, and Jingwei gave us their presentations on specific bacterial targeting of tumors, intratumoral penetration, and native bacterial cytotoxicity.  An later added illustrations on Salmonella typhimurium with the information he found.
During the presentations, other students raised questions to further dig into the review. For example, when talking about TNF-α, we had doubts on human immune system, the infection of S. typhimurium, and the function of this factor.  Though we couldn't explain all these questions now, these discussions indeed broadened our minds.
In the end of the meeting, we assigned everyone tasks as usual.  Although the exams are coming, giving us pressure on our study, we will still working hard towards our goal.

Today we continuing to focus on document reading like last week.
Bomiao and Bei firstly illustrated on cytotoxic agents, cytokines, tumor-specific antigens and antibodies, gene transfer and gene silencing.  Among all these topics, the one of expression of anti-cancer agents caught the attention of us all.  Everyone presented his own opinions on this topic, especially in the transfer of genetic material in mammals by bacteria.
In the second part, Wenping described to us particularly on gene-triggering strategies, focusing on the pictures of the mechanism.  She tried hard to explain in detail, and asked us to understand it with the knowledge of molecular biology.  And it worked out.
After that, our new teammate Zhifei Yuan elaborated on detection.  Though he doesn't major in biology and is new to our team, his thinking is distinct and in order, and prepared well in the background knowledge.
Finally, Xiang concluded on applications of bacteria in cancer therapies.  Apart from the existing techniques and methods, and the development situation, he also gave us his prediction on the developments of bacteria targeting cancer therapy in the future.  Through his presentation, we learned more about our orientation of work ahead.
6.16(A)
In this meeting, we talk about the experiments we fall.
Recently we tried to knock out the relevant genes of VNP20009. But there were no positive results.  After second consideration, we make our next plan. In the future we are going to try different concentrations of L-arabinose, We will assay 1 mM (indicated in the original  protocol),  10  mM  and  0.1  M  of  L-arabinose. After  transformation  of  the  amplimer,  the  cells  were recovered in 1 ml of LB and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C (as suggested in the original method). In the next week we will try a serious of  time of incubation and temperature 30°C  before  plating.
We hope we can have a good result.
