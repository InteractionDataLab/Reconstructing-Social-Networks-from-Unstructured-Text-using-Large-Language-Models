An Hu Home > member
Here is a Chinese boy named An Hu, a senior student studying in Nanjing University. I dreamed of becoming a zoologist when I was little, because I am a crazy zoophile. However, I chose a different way which is to protect human instead of animals so that I will try my best to be a biochemist.  I'm proud of my dream now.  I took part in iGEM to practice myself, and I hope to make friends with you all. :)
