Bei Wang Home > member
I'm a junior student majoring in life science.  This is my first summer doing researches as an iGEM member.  Although I am new to the bacterial world, I feel that my previous knowledge and experience in molecular biology have been beneficial, which made me feel well involved.  During this process, I've learned many interesting things out of books.  Besides, I've got the chance to know many different people who share the same interest in biology with me.  I hope every one of us can work hard together and make a contribution to the iGEM.
