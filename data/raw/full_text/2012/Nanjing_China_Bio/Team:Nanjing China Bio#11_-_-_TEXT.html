My name is Kevin Huang, a 21-year-old student from Nanjing University majoring in life science.  During my leisure time, I love to play basketball and read comics, and I have a degree of understanding of both of them.  I am a person fond of thinking, which is why I'm suitable for doing researches.  This is my first time to participate in such an international competition, iGEM, and I believe I can learn a lot from it.
