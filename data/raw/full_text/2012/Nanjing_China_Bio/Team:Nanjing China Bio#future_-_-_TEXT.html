Method
In our experiments of A, we used the background information that the concentration of amino acid glucose and other nutrition inside the tumors is much higher than that in normal tissues. We knocked out the gene which encoding arginine of VNP, expecting that after the targeting, the VNP will mostly colonize the tumor areas, where the nutrition is the most abundant. In the future, we will introduce this kind of VNP into the mice with melanoma to see whether our modified VNP can really work on the life prolonging of the mice with cancer.
In our experiments of B, we got some anaerobic promoters, which will improve the bacteria's ability of targeting inside the oxygen-poor cells and tissues including the tumor where the quantity of oxygen is much lower than that in common tissues. In other words, the result provides us with a new future direction of cancer therapy ------we can introduce the efficient anaerobic promoters into VNP, which will target inside the tumors and decrease the side-effect of the VNP to the lowest. In order to prove our assumption, we will have our experiments of introducing the VNP with the promoter we designed into the mice with melanoma to see whether the lifetime of the mice can be prolonged with the help of our designed promoters. We hope it can really work!
