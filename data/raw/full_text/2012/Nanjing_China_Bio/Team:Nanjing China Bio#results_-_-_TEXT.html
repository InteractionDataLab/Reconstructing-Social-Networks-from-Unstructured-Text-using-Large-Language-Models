Data
All parts that we make consist of an anaerobic promoter and a luciferase gene. The luciferase gene was cloned from the iGEM part K387009, which has a RBS region, luciferase gene and two terminals.
There are 17 anaerobic promoters cloned in two different ways. Firstly, we ask 8 anaerobic promoter from iGEM. Secondly, we cloned 9 anaerobic promoters from BL21 genomic DNA , one E.coli strain. The information of these promoters is from the paper Effect of anaerobic promoters on the microaerobic production of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) in recombinant Escherichia coli, and thanks to their great work.
The anaerobic promoters from iGEM parts are listed below

Then, we link hypoxia-induced nirB promoter to the plasmid pSB1C3, because we want more iGEMers can use the promoter to do their research.
Then we put plasmids that each has an anaerobic promoter and a luciferase gene into VNP20009 by electroporation. Then we tested the strength and anaerobic sensitivity of our promoters by measuring the fluorescence strength of each VNP strain that has a different promoter after the anaerobic culture.
