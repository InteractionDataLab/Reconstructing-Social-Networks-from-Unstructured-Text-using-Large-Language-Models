Salmonella selection Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009 (VNP) has unique characteristics of high tumor targeting and low toxicity.  It can highly colonize central parts of tumor tissues.  Our project aims to decrease the influence of the bacteria on normal tissues by enhancing the bacteria's ability of tumor targeting through modifying the amino acid metabolism pathways.  We also use VNP as a vector to express exogenous genes with anaerobic promoters in the upper stream to further improve the effect of tumor targeting.  Thus, the bacteria could be used as an efficient method of tumor treatment.                                    ... learn more>>
Tumor-Targeted: tumor-targeting provides a high-performance manner in which we can treat cancer more accurately.
Salmonella: a kind of harmful bacterium may be the light to a harmful disease.
Anaerobic promoter: it can lead to the expression of some antitumor agents directly inside the tumor.
Kongfu-bacteria: the bacteria we designed is just like a Kongfu-panda,using its terrific "Kongfu" to kill tumors.
Auxotrophy：the inability of the Salmonella to synthesize a particular organic compound required for its growth.

Our team is composed of 15 undergraduates, 1 postgraduate, and 4 guide teachers. We built this team based on our common interest in iGEM and synthetic biology. We have a diverse background with students from School of Life Science, School of Computer Science and School of Journalism and Communication. This is the first year for our university to take part in iGEM competition, and we would like to compete with other teams from other famous universities, share happiness and reap friendship.

5.12(all) This is our first regular meeting since we formed our iGEM team.  During this meeting, we introduced ourselves to each other, and learned more about our goal.  Our team consists of sophomore and junior students from different departments.
The first section was given by Kevin about the general background of iGEM and the specific requirements of the competition.  The techniques that could be used in our experiments were also introduced, and it's lucky to know that we have already learned the fundamental knowledge of these techniques.
