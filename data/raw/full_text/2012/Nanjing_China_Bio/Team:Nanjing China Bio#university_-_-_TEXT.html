NANJING UNIVERSITY
Nanjing University, one of China`s key comprehensive universities under the direct supervision of the Ministry of Education,                           dates from 1902 when it was known as Sanjiang Normal School. In October 1950, as required by the Ministry of Education, the                           name was changed to Nanjing University (NJU). In its over 100 years' history, NJU has cultivated a great number of prominent                            and learned figures, and thus has greatly contributed to the nation's revitalization and development. With its multi-disciplinary                           programs and distinguished faculty, NJU leads the institutions of higher learning in China.
