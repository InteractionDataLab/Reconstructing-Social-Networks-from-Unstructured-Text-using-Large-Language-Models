Xianwei Chen Home > member
My name is Xianwei Chen, an easy-going and friendly boy who wishes to make friends.  Tennis is my favorite sport and I wish to have more communication with friends who share the same hobby.  My major is life science and I have tremendous interest in this field, especially molecular biology and genetics. Recently, synthetic biology drew my attention greatly. I am honored to have an opportunity to join in this team. By designing and doing experiments, I had a wonderful experience of iGEM.
