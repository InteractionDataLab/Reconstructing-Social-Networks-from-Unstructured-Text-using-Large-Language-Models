Bacterial Growth Experiment
Autoclave the spinner flask with copper sparger in the correct position.
Mix and autoclave 1L LB solution and add to the spinner flask.
Add 1 ml ampicillin and 1ml ampicillin-resistant E coli into the LB media.
Put the spinner flask in the incubator at 37°C.
Remove 200µL for a sample and measure the optical density in reference to the optical density of a LB sample (negative control).
Repeat the experiment three times: one with the spinner only, one with the air sparger only, and one with both air sparger and spinner on.
