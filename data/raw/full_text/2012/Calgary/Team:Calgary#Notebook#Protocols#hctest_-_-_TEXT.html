Hydrocarbon Test
Add 100 mL water and 5mL canola oil to a small beaker, repeat for 5 beakers.
Dip a belt into the water/canola oil solution for 3 seconds, pull out and scrape removed solution into an empty beaker. Repeat 5 times.
Perform previous step in a separate beaker for each belt sample.
Measure mass of each beaker with a scale to see which belt skimmed most hydrocarbons.
Record observations of color of the solutions in each skimmed solution beaker.
Based on the color and mass of each skimmed beaker, rank belts from greatest to worst for ability to pick up hydrocarbons.
