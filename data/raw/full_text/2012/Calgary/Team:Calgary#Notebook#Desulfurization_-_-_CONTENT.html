Thanks!</P></DIV><H1 id="pagetitle">Desulfurization Journal</H1><H2>Week 1 (May 1-4)</H2><P>During this week, literature search was performed.</P><H2>Week 2 (May 7-11)</H2><P>Along with the rest of the team, this week was dedicated to familiarizing ourselves on the protocols that will be utilized during this years project; specifically the polymerase chain reaction, gel verification, preparation of overnight cultures, as well as developing a procedural flowchart to transform competent cells with registry biobricks. With regards to our sub-group specific goals, we reviewed the current available literature around various industrial and laboratory approaches to desulfurization of organic groups, especially in the petroleum industry. This included a comparison of non-biological processes such as conventional hydrodesulfurization, which is currently employed in petroleum product refinery stages, and how a biological approach would supplement and perhaps even offer several advantages over these methods. Current limitations to biological desulfurization, however, include such factors as biocatalyst stability, enzyme specificity and desulfurization rate. We also identified the enzyme desulfinase (DszB) as being one of the bottlenecks in the desulfurization 4S pathway. Overall, our goals moving forward involve determining the specific pathways involved in the desulfurization process as well as the reaction conditions we would want to employ, and identifying specific model compounds in addition to dibenzothiophene (DBT) that we could use to test the effectivity of our biosystem in order to determine its functionality in the conversion of naphthenic acids to economically valuable hydrocarbons.</P><H2>Week 3 (May 14-18)</H2><P> Building on the previous week's literature review, the 4S pathway was recognized as the preferred biological mechanism that we would explore in devising a desulfurization biosystem. Of specific interest is the dsz operon consisting of the genes for <I> dszA, dszB, </I>and<I> dszC</I> which selectively and non-destructively remove the sulfur from the hydrocarbon structure, and therefore preserves the carbon skeleton. In addition to these, another dsz gene exists.<I> dszD</I>, which codes for a FMN:NADH reductase, is an essential component of the pathway, but not part of the operon. Instead, it is on the genome. The enzyme produced by this gene is required to regenerate the FMNH2 consumed by the reactions carried out by DszA and DszC. <I>Rhodococcus erythropolis</I> IGTS8 is the most studied model organism in investigations of the 4S pathway, and has been shown in many different research endeavors to be capable of converting DBT to 2-HBP.</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:752px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 1: The 4S Desulfurization Pathway, showing the desulfurization of the model compound DBT by DszA, DszB, DszC, and DszD. Four enzymes are involved in the 4S pathway, 3 of which are directly involved in the conversion of DBT to 2-HBP. Dibenzothiophene monooxygenase (DszC) is responsible for the first two steps of the pathway, converting DBT to DBT-sulfoxide and finally to DBT-sulfone (DBTO2) through the addition of oxygen to the sulfur atom. DBT-sulfone monooxygenase (DszA) then carries out the next step in the pathway, producing 2-hydroxybiphenyl-2-sulfinic acid (HBPS) through addition of a final oxygen to the heteroatom. This causes cleavage of the chemical bonds at the heteroatom, breaking the ring and converting the compound from a 3-ring structure to a 2-ring structure. HBPS is then converted to the final product of the 4S pathway by HBPS desulfinase (DszB), producing 2-hydroxybiphenyl. At this point, the sulfur has been released from the hydrocarbon in the form of sulfite.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>
 An alternative to the DszD gene is HpaC, an oxidoreductase encoded in the <I>E. coli</I> W genome. This enzyme has been shown to increase the rate of desulfurization. Following this, other protocols added to our growing lab methods 'toolkit' were a restriction digest protocol, PCR purification, and finally, DNA construction digest. Aims moving forward include obtaining strains of the <I> R. erythropolis </I>, while also executing a timeline devised to biobrick, test, and incorporate the genes necessary in the above processes in a biobrick circuit.</P><H2>Week 4 (May 22-25)</H2><P>This week was kicked off with a project development meeting with Emily and David, and we devised a protocol for biobricking the <I> hpaC </I> gene. Additionally, methods to place the genes coding for the 4 enzymes, DszA,B,C and HpaC into a single construct were explored. Within the lab, the PCR performed on the resuspended pUC18-hpaC was not successful initially.  
Furthermore, we ordered the substrates/compounds that we intend to use for desulfurization tests. Once the substrates and the <I>Rhodococcus</I> strain arrive we are going to test how effectively the bacteria can desulfurize different sulphur-containing compounds that resemble naphthenic acids. Finally, we came across a paper where a team had developed an improved efficiency DszB through site-directed mutagenesis in 2007. This was through a point mutation to the gene, converting a tyrosine at position 63 to a phenylalanine residue. A member of this team was contacted to request the plasmid that contains the mutated gene. The conversion step carried out by DszB is the major bottleneck in the 4S pathway and if a strain or sample containing this mutation was obtained, it would significantly bolster our later testing efforts on DBT, as well as other compounds such as thiophane.
</P><H2>Week 5 (May 28 - June 1)</H2><P>Since we wanted to make sure we would not run out of pUC18(plasmid containing the hpaC gene), we transformed some E.coli cells with it. We grew them on plates containing ampicillin (A), kanamycin (K), tetracycline (T) and chloramphenicol (C) antibiotics and they only grew on A. Therefore pUC18 has A resistance. We did a three sets of PCR with primers designed against <I>hpaC</I>, one using 1/10 dilution of pUC18, the other using 1/100 dilution of pUC18 and one with the colonies we had just obtained by transforming the <I>E.coli</I> cells. </P><P>The PCR worked and we saw bands of the same size for all three sets of PCR. (Unfortunately, the picture we saved is not a good one since some of the bands faded away under UV due to prolonged exposure. Following this, PCR purification was performed to obtain the pure <I>hpaC</I> with biobrick prefix and suffix attatched to gene, which would allow us to insert the sequence into a biobrick standard backbone. 3 sets of digestion, ligation, and transformation (using pairs of X&amp;P enzymes, E&amp;S enzymes and E&amp;P enzymes) were carried out in order to insert the <I>hpaC </I> gene into the <A href=" http://partsregistry.org/Part:pSB1C3">pSB1C3</A>
 vector. All the sets grew successfully.
Following the above successes with<I> hpaC</I>, the arrival of our <I>Rhodococcus</I> strain afforded us the opportunity to begin investigation of the Dsz operon using the primers currently in our possession. This strain is an environmental isolate that has been shown to be an active desulfurizer. The gram-positive nature of the strain also dictated we explore various lysing strategies before the genes encoding the Dsz enzymes could be amplified for further purification and biobrick construction steps. PCR was carried out using <I>dszA</I> primers on three different treatments {microwave, lysate buffer, and a control} which yielded banding pattern around 1200 base pairs for the lysate treatment (2%SDS and 10% tritonX-100, plus heat for 5mins at 98C).
</P><H2>Week 6 (June 4 - June 8)</H2><P> In order to confirm the <I>hpaC</I> biobrick construction, two sets of colony PCR were performed, choosing white colonies from the 3 plates we grew last week (white colonies indicate a loss of the RFP generator in the <A href=" http://partsregistry.org/Part:pSB1C3">pSB1C3</A>
 backbone, and therefore allow for weeding out of the colonies which are simply the original plasmid vector). These reactions were carried out both with <I>hpaC</I> primers and with standard biobrick primers designed against the plasmid backbone. After running them on the gel we saw equal bands for the PCR reactions performed using <I>hpaC</I> primers (However, a PCR using biobrick primers was performed later and the same results were obtained). Colonies 1(-) and 5(-) were used to make overnight cultures, which were then miniprepped the following day to obtain the plasmid DNA of the putative <I>hpaC</I> biobrick. Digestions were performed on the miniprep products using EcoRI and PstI to look for part size as further verification for the genes presence in the plasmid. The results were good and two bands were observed on each column (one for vector and the other for <I>hpaC</I>)). <I>hpaC</I> was sent in for sequencing. </P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:702px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 2: HpaC verification cPCR. HpaC gene was inserted into the pSB1C33 vector and E. coli cells were transformed. In order to confirm that pSB1C3 contains the hpaC gene, two sets of colony PCR's were conducted. One with biobrick primers, and the other with hpaC primers. Bands indicate successful amplification at the approximate size of the hpaC gene (517 bp)</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:420px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 3: HpaC confirmation digest. Plasmid was miniprepped and digested for 2h with EcoRI and SpeI before being run on a 1% gel for 1h and 120V. Bands between 500 and 700 bp indicate the hpaC part is present as an insert. Bands of about 2000bp show the size of the psb1c3 vector.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P> PCR reagents were prepared to re-test/confirm previous results of <I>dszA</I> amplification following two different lysing treatments (microwave + lysate buffer). This time, all three genes were amplified and gel verification showed clear banding patterns around 500bp range for all three genes for the microwave treatment. Remaining PCR products were run on a gel and extracted for further purification steps; however, presence of any genetic material were not confirmed through nanodropping which raised concerns about the composition of the purified products, the success of the initial amplification step, or perhaps even the lysis treatment. Further experimentation will have to be carried out to troubleshoot.</P><H2>Week 7 (June 11 - June 15)</H2><P> This week, we focused on amplifying <I>dsz</I> genes from our <I>Rhodococcus</I> strain for construction into biobricks. We also wanted to purify the <A href=" http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K902057"> BBa_K902057 <I>hpaC</I></A> and pUC18-<I>hpaC</I> plasmids to replenish our current stocks. For the <I>dsz</I> aspect, we were able to successfully grow extra plates of <I>Rhodococcus</I> strain which was used to inoculate PCR tubes. The PCR did not go well, with significant streaking and false positives with similar banding pattern to previous gels run in the previous week. A final gel verification of a random sample of a tube of PCR products from dszA,B,C respectively and two negative control treatments involving master mix only and the lysed cells only illustrated the lack of discrepancy between the supposed successful amplification and the lysed cells (with lysate buffer) alone. Because of this we decided to take a different approach involving plasmid isolation carried out before PCR, rather than applying the PCR reagents directly to a lysed culture sample.</P><P><A href=" http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K902057"><I>hpaC</I></A> verification through sequencing was successful, confirming the construction of our first biobrick. Subsequently, O/N cultures of the plasmid containing cultures were prepared and stored in glycerol at -80C. Furthermore, verification of catalase gene part (<A href=" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K137068"><I>katG-LAA</I></A>), which was sent as a culture stab from the parts registry was initiated. Our newly identified biobricked-hpaC was used as a positive control, but the banding pattern was not very conclusive. </P><H2>Week 8 (June 18 - June 22)</H2><P>PCR was reattempted on <I>Rhodoccocus</I> that was lysed using two different dilutions of the lysate buffer, but the gel verification confirmed the previous failure in using this approach. An alternative that involved preparation of an overnight culture of the <I>Rhodococcus</I> cells followed by a plasmid purification was followed. The plasmid purification eventually yielded plasmid samples with concentrations of 98.6ng/Î¼L to 182.7ng/Î¼L (4 samples obtained overall). Additionally, the catalase biobrick was used to transform some stock competent cells, and samples of some colonies were subsequently PCR'ed. Although, the gel verification showed some potential contamination, and the required banding patterns at around 2200bp was not obtained. </P><H2>Week 9 (June 25 - June 29)</H2><P> PCR was attempted to amplify the genes of the <I>dsz</I> operon utilising an adapted PCR protocol with purified <I>Taq</I> polymerase that had been isolated from the host organism. Eventually, some banding pattern was obtained between 1200 and 1500 base pairs when a gradient thermocycler was used with melting temperatures ranging betweeen 55Â°C to 65Â°C. This was assumed to be indicative of successful amplification of <I>dszB</I>; however, further purification and gel verification results were inconclusive and no yield was obtained when placed tested using a nanodrop machine. </P><H2>Week 10 (July 2-July 6)</H2><P>Top 10 E.coli cells were transformed with <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0011">BBa_R0011</A>
 (IPTG inducible promoter in psb1C3 backbone), and resulting colonies were tested using cPCR. 
Colony PCR was performed on cells containing the catalase biobrick. Catalase is 2217bp long but since biobrick primers add about 200bp, bands of 2400 bp were expected if the part was present in the biobrick. These bands were observed, indicating that the <A href=" http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K137068"><I>katG-LAA</I></A> gene was most likely present.</P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:502px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 4: Colony PCR on potential colonies containing katG-LAA. Biobrick primers were used. Bands at 2200 indicate successful amplification of the catalase part within the biobrick backbone. Smaller bands are indicative of primer degradation and are nonspecific amplification. +C indicates the positive control, and RFP generator, which should amplify at around 1000 bp.</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>

PCR using Phusion high fidelity polymerase was carried out on <I>dszA</I>, <I>dszB</I>, and <I>dszC</I> in a gradient thermocycler. Amplification of non-specific bands was present for <I>dszA</I> and <I>dszB</I>, however strong banding for the desired size of the gene was observed for both (around 1500 for <I>dszA</I>, 1100 for <I>dszB</I></P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:502px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 5:DszA and DszB PCR from  <I>Rhodococcus</I>. DszA amplicon is around 1300 bp, and is observed to run higher on the gel. DszB amplicon is expected to be 1098 bp, which is observed in addition to multiple nonspecific banding. +C indicates the positive control, and RFP generator, which when PCRed with biobrick primers should be around 1000 bp. As this control is running high as well, it is believed that both amplicons for DszA and DszB have been obtained. No contamination is observed in the NTC (no template control).</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:502px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 6:DszC PCR from  <I>Rhodococcus</I>. The numbers above the figure show the colony number. DszC amplicon is around 1450 bp, and is observed to run at almost the right size on the gel. No contamination is observed in the NTC (no template control).</DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><P>
 Examining the sequences of the <I>dszABC</I> genes led to the discovery that all 4 had multiple illegal enzyme cut-sites in them that we have to eliminate before biobrick composite part construction can occur. <I>dszA</I> has four PstI cut sites, <I>dszB</I> has a PstI and a NotI and <I>dszC</I> has a PstI cut site. The Stratagene QuickChange mutagenesis procedure is going to be used to eliminate illegal cut sites with the only alteration being that Kapa HiFi polymerase would be used during the process. Primers needed for the mutagenesis were designed based on the procedure mentioned above. </P><H2>Week 11 (July  9-July 13)</H2><P> Following successful amplification of the <I>dsz</I> operon genes in the previous week, the genes were constructed into the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:pSB1C3"> pSB1C3</A> vector. Colony PCR verifications were observed to be positive. Furthermore, the insertion of part <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J13002"> BBa_J13002, (P<SUB>tetR</SUB>-RBS)</A>
  in front of the previously biobricked <I>hpaC</I> was attempted. Overnight cultures were also prepared using two colonies each for <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J13002"><I>P<SUB>tetR</SUB>-RBS</I></A>  and <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0011"><I>P<SUB>lacI</SUB></I></A>  (an IPTG inducible promoter that we hope to build in front of <AHREF>an RBS site, BBa_B0034). These cultures were then miniprepped to yield the respective parts.</AHREF></P><P>Additionally, <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K137068"><I>katG-LAA</I></A> was built into a <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:PSB1C3"> PSB1C3</A> backbone. The construction and availability of all these parts will be critical in the construction of our overall circuit for biodesulfurization. Colonies which looked good on cPCR were used to prepare overnight cultures, and were miniprepped and sent in for sequencing verification the following day.
On the side, M9 minimal media was also prepared to carry out growth experimentation and overall desulfurization capability of <I>Rhodococcus</I> when exposed to DBT. The various growth treatments were M9 Media and glucose only, M9+glucose+DBT, M9+glucose+MgSO4+/-DBT, M9+glucose+MgCl2+/-DBT. 0.008g of FeCl2.4H2O was also added to each of the tubes. Samples were then inoculated with colonies of the <I>Rhodococcus</I>.</P><H2>Week 12 (July  16 -July 20)</H2><P>This week, while awaiting sequencing verification results which were required before we could begin the construction process, the desulfurization team initially aided in some of the tasks related to the other hydrocarbon groups. The success of the construction of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J13002"><I>P<SUB>tetR</SUB></I>-RBS</A>
with <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K902057"><I>hpaC</I></A> was also explored by using forward and reverse primers of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0040">BBa_R0040</A> (the promoter component of the composite part BBa_J13002). However, the eventual gel verification was inconclusive and sequencing results finally indicated an unsuccessful ligation. Additionally, the minimal media M9 preparation had been contaminated in the previous effort so this process was repeated to create tubes of each of the growth condition treatments detailed previously, and two repeats, one with an extra filtration step and one without was used to prepare the cultures.</P><H2>Week 13 (July 23 - July 27)</H2><P> Mutagenic primers were redesigned after the initial ones were found to have premature stop codons. As part of the redesign process in constructing our overall gene circuits for desulfurization, a backbone switch of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0011"> BBa_R0011</A> into a chloramphenicol (Chlor) resistant vector was necessary. The subsequent transformed products were plated on a Chlor plate and selected colonies were used to prepare O/N cultures, then minipreped before finally being digested with enzymes EcoRI and PstI. The resulting gel verification images were inconclusive as they did not show the required banding pattern around 50bp. Meanwhile, colony PCR was run on colonies transformed with <I>katG-LAA</I> constructed into a <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:PSB1C3"> PSB1C3</A> backbone, as well as the <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K902057"><I>hpaC</I></A> +<A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J13002">BBa_J13002</A> construct. <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K137068"><I>katG-LAA</I></A> was shown to have been successfully amplified, so overnight cultures were prepared and subsequently miniprepped. On the other hand, the construct was not successful so a third attempt was carried out. Colony PCR treatments that used either <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0011"> BBa_R0011</A> forward primers or <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_B0034">BBa_B0034</A>
 primers were used and the overall constructs were made either on a chlor-resistant, or ampicillin-resistant vectors. Preliminary images of the gel verification appeared to have confirmed the construct, although sequencing verification will be the final indicator of overall success. </P><H2>Week 14 (July 30 - August 3)</H2><P>Sequencing results from the previous week's constructs were available confirming that we constructed KatGLAA in a chlor-resistant backbone. However, switching the plasmid backbone of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_R0011"> BBa_R0011</A> to <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:PSB1C3"> PSB1C3</A> was not successful.  The construction of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J13002">BBa_J13002</A>+<A href="http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K902057"><I>hpaC</I></A> was finally sent in for sequencing.  Site-directed mutagenesis of the <I>dsz</I> operon was also initiated:  <I>dszA</I> has four PstI cut sites; <I>dszB</I> has a PstI and a NotI site; <I>dszC</I> has two PstI cut sites.  Site directed mutagenesis was started this week to change a single base pair in these genes in a way that eliminates the cut site but preserves the amino acid codons, so as to not mutate the protein coding sequence.  Ohshiro 2007 demonstrated that replacing the Tyr residue at position 63 of <I>dszB</I> gene with a Phe increases the activity of the enzyme.  Therefore we want to introduce the same mutation into our <I>dszB</I>.</P><P>
 For the first attempt at mutagenesis we chose to mutate the second PstI site in <I>dszC</I> (PstI2).  As a positive control for the procedure, we also performed the mutagenic PCR on a plasmid containing the Î²-galactosidase gene with a point mutation where the PCR would cause it to regain its function.  For both mutagenesis protocols we used the Kappa Hifi kit.  After confirming that the PCR worked by running some produce on a gel, the PCR products were DpnI digested, the purpose of which is to degrade the unmodified parental DNA (DpnI degrades methylated DNA only).  Control PCR products were plated on an ampicillin plate containing IPTG and X-gal. The colonies that grew on the control plates were blue indicating that the mutagenesis had worked for the Î²-galactosidase gene.  Minipreps of the O/N culture of <I>dszC</I> mutants were digested with PstI enzyme and the results indicated that the mutagenesis was successful.</P><P> 
Attempts to simultaneously perform all the mutations in <I>dszC</I> genes in one step using the Knight procedure failed (<A href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/Knight:Site-directed_mutagenesis/Multi_site">Knight Multi-site Mutagenesis Procedure</A>). What enables simultaneous mutations is that Taq ligase closes the gaps in PCR products after each cycle. In the protocol it instructs to use Taq ligase buffer only for the PCR/ligation protocol. We suspected that the reason this procedure did not work might be that the Kappa polymerase is not functional in Taq ligase buffer. Therefore we did some experiments on the controls in Taq ligase kit and kappa polymerase kit to find out which buffer that Kappa polymerase and Taq ligase both work best in. The result was that both enzymes work best in a buffer made of half Taq ligase buffer and half Kappa polymerase buffer. </P><DIV class="center"><DIV class="thumb tnone"><DIV class="thumbinner" style="width:502px;"><DIV class="thumbcaption">Figure 7: DszC PstI2 mutagenesis PCR with varying concentrations of template plasmid was performed.

Briefly, after the PCR mutagenesis the PCR products were purified and then incubated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) and ligase.

<I>dszB</I>(PstI and Y63F mutated)-NotI and <I>dszA</I>(PstI1 and PstI3 mutated)-PstI4 mutagenesis were also performed.</P><P> To investigate the desulfurisation capability of the <I>Rhodococcus</I> sp. from which we cloned the <I>dsz</I> operon, a desulfurization assay was prepared by inoculating different treatments of M9 media.  We also prepared some solutions that will be needed for analysis in the following week: a conditioning agent composed of 100ml of 95% ethanol, 50ml glycerol, 30ml of 12M HCl (aq) and 70g of NaCl(s) was prepared. The assay relies on the turbidity of a sample containing sulphate ions which are precipitated (hence the turbidometric nature of the assay) upon adding BaCl2(s), therefore if the <I>dsz</I> pathway is active, we expect a more turbid solution to form than in control samples. </P><H2>Week 17 (August 19 - August 25)</H2><P>This week, progress was made in determining the desulfurization activity of our <I>Rhodococcus</I> strain as measured by the sulfate release using a turbidometric assay. We encountered several challenges in our prescribed protocol as the concentrations that we used to prepare the standard curve may have been too dilute, or the composition of out conditioning agent may have been flawed. Additionally, steps were taken to determine the decomposition of DBT to 2-HBP through Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis, but due to a preparation error, the DBT was added to a growth solution of M9 media prematurely and the autoclaving process decomposed the DBT releasing a yellow colouration into the solution. These two approaches in determining the desulfurization capability of the <I>dsz</I> operon will be further investigated. </P><P>Since the <I>dszC</I> second mutagenesis had proven to be unsuccessful last week, the <I>dszC</I>(PstI2 mutated)PstI1 mutagenesis was repeated.

Meanwhile, a round of traditional construction appears to have finally created the parts <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K902079"><I>P<SUB>tetR</SUB></I>-<I>dszB</I>-B0034-<I>dszC</I></A>, <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K902080"><I>P<SUB>lacI</SUB></I>-<I>dszB</I>-B0034-<I>dszC</I></A>, and <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K902081"><I>P<SUB>lacI</SUB></I>-<I>hpaC</I>-B0034-<I>katG</I></A>. Though sequence confirmation could not be obtained before Wiki-Freeze, we are confident that these parts are correct due to the clear size difference seen between these parts and their sub-parts. A plasmid switch was attempted the night before DNA submission had to be sent, however due to technical issues the incubator stayed at a low temperature overnight, and cultures did not grow enough to obtain the first two parts in a pSB1C3 backbone. Because of the difficulty assembling these parts, the deadline for DNA submission, and the fact that having them in an alternate backbone in the registry would allow for easier and quicker assembly of the sulfur operon by others (no plasmid switches of large parts would have to be performed, as we have found that plasmid switching the larger constructs is quite difficult.) we decided to submit these parts in an ampicillin backbone. Further attempts to switch the backbone for these parts will continue, and hopefully we will be able to submit them in the standard backbone at a later date before the competition. In addition, a reconstruction of <A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K902051">B0034-<I>dszA</I></A> was obtained and finally, at long last, sequence confirmed. Because of the verification of this part and the excellent sequence read when compared to those obtained for the previously submitted version, we decided to also resubmit this part to the registry.</P><P>Construction attempts of the operon will continue into the following week, as only 1 additional construction is needed to assemble a testable version of the operon. Hopefully, this data will be obtained before the competition, and documented on the respective parts pages.</P><P>This is the Desulfurization Team, signing off.</P></DIV><DIV class="printfooter">
