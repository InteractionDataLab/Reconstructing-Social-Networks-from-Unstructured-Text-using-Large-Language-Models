Potentiostatic Standard Curve Generation
Once basic electrochemical characterization has been conducted with cyclic voltammetry and the oxidation potential has been determined we can hold our working electrode at that voltage and watch the chemical reaction happen in real time. The observed current is proportional to the amount of the chemical that is being oxidized in the solution. By creating a standard curve we can relate this current to the concentration. To generate a standard curve, follow the protocol below:
Prepare 25mL 0.1M pH7 PBS.
Submerge the electrodes.
Place lid on cell.
Insert a needle and bubble nitrogen or argon gas into the solution for 5 minutes.
Hold working electrode at the oxidation potential of the analyte.
Allow 5 minutes for the current to stabilize.
Add aliquots of the analyte in 1 minute intervals.
Record current increases between each addition.
TIP: Smaller aliquots of the analyte will give better resolution on a standard curve
Plot the data as current vs concentration and add a trendline
