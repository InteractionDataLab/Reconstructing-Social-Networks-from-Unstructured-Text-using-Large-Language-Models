Tailings Test
Add 100 mL water and 5mL tailings sample to a small beaker, repeat for 5 beakers.
Dip a belt into water/tailings solution for 3 seconds, pull out and scrape removed solution into an empty beaker. Repeat 5 times.
Perform the previous step in a separate beaker for each belt sample.
Measure the mass of each beaker with a scale to see which belt skimmed most tailings.
Record observations of color of the solution in each skimmed solution beaker.
Based on the color and mass of each skimmed beaker, rank belts from greatest to worst for the inability to pick up tailings (i.e. higher rank indicate that less tailings are picked up).
