Catalase Assay
The purpose of this protocol is to test the ability of KatG-LAA to detoxify hydrogen peroxide. This was important, as catalase will be encorporated into the final sulfur circuit as an optimization feature.
Grow cultures of E. coli J04500-katG+LAA and J04500 overnight at 37*C in LB with appropriate antibiotics.
The following evening, innoculate 20 uL into 3 mL LB with varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (0 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM) and grow overnight.
The following morning, observe and record culture turbidity.
