See all of the iGEM 2012 results here and here !
See what we accomplished since the Americas West Regionals!
In our Human Practices project, we...
Returned to industry experts to see if we accomplished our goals and what the next steps should be.
Characterized the functionality of our previously submitted Prha (BBa_K902066) promoter using GFP fluorescence.
Tested an additional complete kill switch device using the Prha (BBa_K902084) promoter with our S7 kill gene.
Tested a glycine auxotroph killswitch .
In terms of FRED, we...
Electrochemically characterized an inducible lacz (BBa_K902090) circuit, replacing a faulty existing circuit in the registry containing a frameshift.
Tested one of our transposon library hits with our electrochemical reporter, showing that we can use our system to detect toxins electrochemically.
Validated our system with tailings using our transposon system and electrochemical reporter to be able to selectively detect toxins on real oil sands samples.
In terms of OSCAR, we...
Obtained additional characterization data in validation of our flux-variability analysis model.
Characterized the ability of our novel amdA (BBa_K902041) BioBrick to selectively remove primary amides from ring structures with remarkable efficiency, turning them into a substrate that the Petrobrick (BBa_K590025) can likely convert into hydrocarbons.
Validated a scale up model for using our bioreactor/belt skimmer system in producing and extracting hydrocarbons.
