Characterization of mgtA regulation with GFP
Cells containing the appropriate circuits were grown in LB overnight with 10mM MgCl2.
mgtAp-rb-K082003
mgtAp-rb
R0040-mgtArb-K082003
R0040-B0034-K082003
The next morning the cells were spun down and washed with M9 minimal media and appropriate amounts of MgCl
0mM MgCl2
0.01mM MgCl2
0.1mM MgCl2
1mM MgCl2
10mM MgCl2
Cells were then aliquoted into 96 well plates in triplicates for each concentration and florescence was measured every hour for 24 hours at 475nm excitation and 515nm emission.
