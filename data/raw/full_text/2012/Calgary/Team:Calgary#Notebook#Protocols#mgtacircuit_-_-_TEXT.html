Characterization of the mgtA regulation with S7 killgene
Cells with the appropriate circuits were grown in LB overnight with 10mM MgCl2.
The next morning the cells were spun down and washed with M9 minimal media and appropriate amounts of MgCl2.
Cells were then aliquoted into 96 well plates in triplicates for each concentration and OD was measured at 600nm for every 4 hour for 8 hours.
Additionally, the cells were plated on the appropriate antibiotic in dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:10000 for measuring CFU.
