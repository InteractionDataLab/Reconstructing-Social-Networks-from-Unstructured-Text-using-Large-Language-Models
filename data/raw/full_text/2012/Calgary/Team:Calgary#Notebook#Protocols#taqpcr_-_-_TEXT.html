Taq PCR Protocol
The following is obtained from the Invitrogen Taq PCR kit (although most PCR kits have similar protocols).
Mastermix setup
Reagent

Thermocycler Conditions
1 Cycle - 10 minutes at 95°C
36 cycles of:
3 minutes at 95°C
1 minute at 55°C (for BioBrick primers)
1 minute/kb at 72°C
1 Cycle - 10 minutes at 72°C then HOLD at 4°C
Conditions were varied as needed. For example in cases of longer products all 1 minute times were increased to 1.5 or even 3 minutes
Follow the same protocol for a colony PCR.
We also used a Taq polymerase that we isolated in-house with slightly different cycling conditions. Since this Taq could not tolerate the lysis stage at 95°C for 10 minutes, the cells were lysed in 4 μL of water for 10 minutes before master mix was added.
