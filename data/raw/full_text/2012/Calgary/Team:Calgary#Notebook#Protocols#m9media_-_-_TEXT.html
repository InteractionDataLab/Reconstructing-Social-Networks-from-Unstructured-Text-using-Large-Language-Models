M9 Minimal Media Preparation
Dissolve the following salts in about 500mL of ddH2O:
12.8 grams anhydrous Na2HPO4
3.0 grams KH2PO4
0.5 grams NaCl
1.0 gram NH4Cl
Bring the media to approximately 950 ml with ddH2O and pH to 7.4 with NaOH.
Autoclave for 20 minutes on slow exhaust. Store at 4°C when finished.
The following salts were dissolved in 50mL of water and cold filtered with a sterilized 0.22 micron filter:
10.8 grams glucose
0.19g of MgCl2
0.0152 grams CaCl2.2H2O
0.0100 grams Thiamine
0.007g of FeCl2.4H2O
Add the filter sterilized solution into the autoclaved media along with any other additives (e.g. antibiotics). Store at 4°C.
