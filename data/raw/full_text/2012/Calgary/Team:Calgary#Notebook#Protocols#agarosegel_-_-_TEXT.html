Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
Reagents and Materials
1X TAE
Graduated Cylinder
125 mL flask
Agarose
Gel Pouring Tray
Tape
Gel rig
SYBR Safe
Protocol
Measure out 100mL of buffer
Transfer buffer to 125 mL flask
Weigh out enough agarose to make a 1% gel (in our case 1.0 g of agarose was the right amount)
Transfer agarose to 125mL flask
Melt agarose in microwave until solution is almost boiling, stirring every 15-20 seconds (should be around 2 minutes)
Allow agarose to cool (do not let it cool to the point where it is hard)
Add 4 uL of SYBR Safe to the cooling agarose
Assemble the gel pouring apparatus by inserting gate into slots.
Allow gel to cool until flask can be handled comfortably.
Place comb in the gel rig.
Pour agarose into gel tray.
Allow to solidify. While the gel is solidifying prepare the samples. Add your sample and 1 uL 10x Loading Dye, 4 uL of DNA and 5 uL of water
Pour 1X TAE over gel so that gel is covered by a 3-5mm buffer
Load samples into lane (Don't forget to load a 1kb+ ladder into one of the lanes)
Hook electrodes to gel apparatus.
Run the apparatus at 100V for 30 - 45 minutes (make sure to watch that the dye does not run off the gel)
Visualize the gel and record the results
