Genome Alberta Blog Posting
Genome Alberta sponsored us this year to share with their website's audience some of the interesting things we were doing with genetics and synthetic biology this year.  We have authored a number of the blog posts and been featured in one of their writer's blog posts.  This was a great way to interface with industry and show a more 'humanistic' side of iGEM.  It also provided a great opportunity to connect with Alberta and Canada's scientific community and industries. More blog posts will find their way up over the next few weeks!
