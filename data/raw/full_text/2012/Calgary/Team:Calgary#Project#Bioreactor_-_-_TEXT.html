Week 1 (May 1-4)
This week we attended a Biosafety and WHIMIS course where we learned how to work safely in a laboratory environment. We also had our first team meeting, where we got to meet everyone and learn more about the biology aspects of the project.
Week 2 (May 7-11)
We started to read different research papers based on the function of different types of bioreactors. This allowed us to begin thinking about which design would best suit the reactions necessary to convert naphthenic acids into hydrocarbons. In addition, we went through online tutorials to learn the MATLAB and Labview computer programs. These programs will be used to create mathematical models to simulate the reactions taking place in the bioreactor.
Week 3 (May 14-18)
Brainstorming continued and ideas were written down on paper for our bioreactor design. Three design alternatives were put forward, and a rough sketch of the bioreactor was drawn. This design included a method to measure and control the pH and temperature, a method of extracting the produced hydrocarbons, an agitator (turbine), a method of oxygen dispersal to the system, and a general shape for the body of the bioreactor.
Week 4 (May 22-25)
Further research was done to try and find out which extraction method would be safest, and leave the lowest chance of the bacteria escaping our system. A physical model of the bioreactor was created using beakers, water, and mineral oil. Mineral oil was added to a beaker of water to simulate a layer of hydrocarbons on top of the tailing pond mixture in a bioreactor. Water was poured into the beaker until the top layer of mineral oil began to flow out of the spout near the top of the beaker. This helped show that adding more tailings pond mixture to the bioreactor to remove the top layer of hydrocarbons is still possible. In addition, different magnetic stirring bars were used to analyze how two distinct layers in solution are able to mix.
We started to learn the Google Sketchup computer program which can be used to create a 3D model of our bioreactor design. However, it is still unknown how to create an actual blueprint of our model.
