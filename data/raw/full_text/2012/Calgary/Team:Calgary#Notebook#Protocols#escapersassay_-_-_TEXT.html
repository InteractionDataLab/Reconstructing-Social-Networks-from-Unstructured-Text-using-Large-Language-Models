Escaper assay for the rhamnose system
The following assay is based on CFU in both Top 10 and glyA knockout of E. coli.
Prha-B0034-S7 was transformed into Top 10 and glyA knockout.
Colonies were inoculated in LB with 2% glucose to make sure the system was turned off and the cells were growing.
The cultures were then aliquoted into equal volumes and washed with the appropriate condition media.
M9 minimal media with 0.2% glucose.
M9 minimal media with 0.2% rhamnose.
All the different cell lines (pRHA-B0034-S7 in Top 10, pRHA-B0034-S7 in gly knockout, gly knockout) were washed with the appropriate media and then plated at dilutions of 1:1000, 1:10000, 1:100000 at 0 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr, 24 hr.
Colonies were counted to measure CFU.
