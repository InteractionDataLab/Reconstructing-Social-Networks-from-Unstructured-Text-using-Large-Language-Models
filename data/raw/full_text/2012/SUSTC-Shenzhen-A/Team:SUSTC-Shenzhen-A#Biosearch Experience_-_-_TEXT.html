MySQL
  We have use MySQL as our relational database management system (RDBMS). The MySQL database has become the world's most popular open source database .Many of the world's largest and fastest-growing organizations including Facebook, Google, Adobe, Alcatel Lucent and Zappos rely on MySQL to save time and money powering their high-volume Web sites, business-critical systems and packaged software. Given these considerations, MySQL has many attractive features to offer:
  
Speed. MySQL is fast. Its developers contend that MySQL is about the fastest database system you can get. You can investigate this claim by visiting http://www.mysql.com/why-mysql/benchmarks/, a performance-comparison page on the MySQL Web site.
  
Ease of use. .MySQL is a high-performance but relatively simple database system and is much less complex to set up and administer than larger systems.
  
Query language support. MySQL understands SQL (Structured Query Language), the standard language of choice for all modern database systems.
  
Capability. The MySQL server is multi-threaded, so many clients can connect to it at the same time. Each client can use multiple databases simultaneously. You can access MySQL interactively using several interfaces that let you enter queries and view the results: command-line clients, Web browsers, or GUI clients. In addition, programming interfaces are available for many languages, such as C, Perl, Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby. You can also access MySQL using applications that support ODBC and .NET (protocols developed by Microsoft). This gives you the choice of using prepackaged client software or writing your own for custom applications.
  
Connectivity and security. MySQL is fully networked, and databases can be accessed from anywhere on the Internet, so you can share your data with anyone, anywhere. But MySQL has access control so that one person who shouldn’t see another’s data cannot. To provide additional security, MySQL supports encrypted connections using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
  
Portability.MySQL runs on many varieties of Unix and Linux, as well as on other systems such as Windows and NetWare. MySQL runs on hardware from high-end servers down to small personal computers (even palmtop devices).
  
Small size. MySQL has a modest distribution size, especially compared to the huge disk space footprint of certain other database systems.
  
Availability and cost. MySQL is an Open Source project available under multiple licensing terms. First, it is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). This means that MySQL is available without cost for most in-house uses. Second, for organizations that prefer or require formal arrangements or that do not want to be bound by the conditions of the GPL, commercial licenses are available.
  
Open distribution and source code. MySQL is easy to obtain; just use your Web browser. If you don’t understand how something works, are curious about an algorithm, or want to perform a security audit, you can get the source code and examine it. If you think you’ve found a bug, please report it; the developers want to know.

Consequently, compared to other products, MySQL is our ideal choice for RDBMS to assist us in accomplishing our iPhone App BioSearch.
