Our projects include Biosearch and Biodesign. Biosearch is an iPhone app which substantially increases the efficiency of searching biobricks in partsregistry.org. Biodesign is a graphics editing application specific to synthetic biology for both iPhone and iPad. Both of them combine efficiency with portability, showing that a new era of mobile biology researching is coming.

  The Main work to deal with first is the database . We get nothing but a file with the format of ‘xml’. It may be very easy work for someone who is professional . But for a beginner like me, the only thing I can do is Google , Google and Google... Fortunately, eventually I finished it.
  
  Core Data is a very useful part of iOS developing . The built-in Sqlite function is the one with which I can set up a built-in database.
  
  the next thing we should overcome is transfer xml to Sqlite. Thankfully there is NSXmlParser Method with which we can finish this work.
  
  why we choose sqlite?
  
  because it provide the function we needed . Network independent, very efficient , and it can store what you search in cache therefore you can get the same search result faster next time.
