A program which could connect mySQL database and load data as well as using mySQL's search funcions was gotten.  .</P><UL><LI>7.17</LI></UL><P>    In the first meeting, our group divided into two parts:UI(part leader: Xiao Tong)&amp; data(part leader:Mubing Zhou). UI members and data members works in pair. All the members made a draft of our project one--Bosearch and looked through partsregistry.org part by part carefully, so that we could choice the functions needed.</P><UL><LI>7.18</LI></UL><P>    In this day we determined three parts of our work: categories, search engine, and search result. We also disgusted the search methods. From now, all the members started our group-work with clear aims. </P><P>    Search Engine group included two members: Xiao Tong and Mubing Zhou. Their main work was to search keywords (or some other functions) which were input by user in the database and passed the summarized results to them. When user clicked one of the results for more details, the part-name was sent to Search Result group.</P><P>    Search Result group included six members: group leader Xin Yang, Deng Pan, Jingyao Guo, Qijia Cheng, Yidan Pan, Yujun Zhao. The main goal of this group was to create an interface to accept the result(part name) of bio-brick searching (which was sent by the SE group),showing the details of this part. In this part, loading database was the most important thing . </P><P>    Category group included four members: Chenchen Lv, Junqiu Zhang, Yiqi Jiang and Zili Fan. They would work on building category-formed-interface to show all the data in partsregistry.org, which simplifys the long spreadsheet into keyword-showing tables. </P></DIV></TD><TD><DIV id="talkbubble1"><DIV class="sidebar_box"><DIV class="sidebar_box_content"><P class="title1">Notebook</P><P><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/Notebook"><STRONG>Overview</STRONG></A></P><P><STRONG>Preparation</STRONG></P><P><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/JC"><STRONG>Journal Club</STRONG></A></P><P><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/FP"><STRONG>Final Project</STRONG></A></P><P><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week1"><STRONG>Xcode Tutorial(week 1)</STRONG></A></P><P><STRONG>Biosearch section1(week2,3)</STRONG></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week2">week 2</A></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week3">week 3</A></P><P><STRONG>Biosearch section2(week4,5)</STRONG></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week4&amp;5">week 4~5</A></P><P><STRONG>Tinker Cell(week,6,7)</STRONG></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week6">week 6</A></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week7">week 7</A></P><P><STRONG>Comprehensive work</STRONG></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week8">week 8</A></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week9">week 9～12</A></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week13">week 13～18</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE width="899" border="0" cellspacing="8px" cellpadding="8px" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV><UL><LI>7.19</LI></UL><P>  SE：Members discussed about the searching methods and searchstring.

By comparing the database and the website, we found that the database was incomplete, which didn't contain the description written by different authors, and the structure was totally different from the website. In order to build a part-name-based search result, we needed to search the whole database again when SE returned us the part name and collected the result.    </P><P>  Xin Yang: Selected important parts of the 13 tables.</P><P>  Deng Pan: Designed the interface of search result</P><P>  Jingyao Guo: Tried to show details from several tables in one page as table form.</P><P>  Qijia Cheng:on vacation</P><P>  Yidan Pan: Tried to show details from several tables in one page as table form.</P><P>  Yujun Zhao: Tested to combine all the tables of the database.</P><P>  </P><UL><LI>7.20</LI></UL><P>  SE：he primary searching method was confirmed as fuzzy search --it meaned if you typed &quot;BBa_&quot; and selected &quot;part name&quot;, the program would give you a result of all the biobricks whose part name included &quot;BBa_&quot;. At this time, the database included 13 different parts.

First, when users type the keyword and clicked &quot;search&quot;, all the tables were searched with this keyword to get the biobrick, then sended the part name to search result part. Then the second search took place when the search result part got the part name. The partn ame was searched in all the tables to give user a detailed page of this biobrick's information.
