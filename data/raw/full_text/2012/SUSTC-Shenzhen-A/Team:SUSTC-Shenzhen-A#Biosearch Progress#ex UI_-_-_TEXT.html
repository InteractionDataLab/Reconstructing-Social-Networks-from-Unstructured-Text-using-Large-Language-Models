Projects
Our projects include Biosearch and Biodesign. Biosearch is an iPhone app which substantially increases the efficiency of searching biobricks in partsregistry.org. Biodesign is a graphics editing application specific to synthetic biology for both iPhone and iPad. Both of them combine efficiency with portability, showing that a new era of mobile biology researching is coming.
