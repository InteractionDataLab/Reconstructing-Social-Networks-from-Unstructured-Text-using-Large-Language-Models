Outlook
  The website "Registry of Standard Biological Parts" promotes the development of synthetic biology through providing genetic parts. To expand its influence in data exchange, we found it necessary to build an app client for it. In order to save time in searching BioBrick, simplify the process of selecting classifications, and facilitate changing selected category, we will dedicate ourselves to adjust database structure so that we can change the interface of BioBrick searching into spinner-formed

Reference
  As shown in the figures, two ways will be provided to search BioBricks .
  
  The first method is a kind of web-of-knowledge-way searching technique which resembles the website www.webofknowledge.com. A common vocabulary for varied search terms related to BioBricks will be provided.Such terms are browse by functions, browse by types, etc. And users can choose the terms they need on their own. This will provide a powerful search function. The second way is a keyword-way search technique. This kind search is simple yet quick. A keyword is input and a set of BioBricks with this key word is returned. We believe that users can find their target BioBricks quickly with the aid of these two search techniques.
  
  Besides, we hope that all of our members can enjoy the process of preparing and presenting our project.
