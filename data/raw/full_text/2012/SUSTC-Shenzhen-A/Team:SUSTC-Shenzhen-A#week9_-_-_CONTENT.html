Dr.Huang was the instructor for HKU during 2010&amp;2011 iGEM competition, so he had a lot of experience to share with us. He mentioned that the selection of iGEM members in HKU started in March and each candidate was required to submit a proposal. In July, experiment officially started. However, from previous experience, experimenting efficiency is quite low due to new member’s lack of proficiency. </P><P>    To solve this kind of problem, universities such as London Imperial College began to prepare for this year’s competition since last year. In addition, he reminded us to prepare answering questions reasonably and logically from the judges who must be very familiar with synthetic biology. Later, our team summarized our recent work. Jiang Yiqi and Guo Jingyao have assigned tasks (designing leaflets, preparing presentation, writing a new song) for volunteers from freshman. Zhu Mubing has solved the problem of non-public API of our first project. Zhang Junqiu and Fan Zili has completed their parts of the second project. Zhao Yujun and Pan Deng have made some progress in optimizing our database. Finally, almost all the team members went to Prof.He’s office to finish their registration to HK.</P></DIV></TD><TD><DIV id="talkbubble1"><DIV class="sidebar_box"><DIV class="sidebar_box_content"><P class="title1">Notebook</P><P><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/Notebook"><STRONG>Overview</STRONG></A></P><P><STRONG>Preparation</STRONG></P><P><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/JC"><STRONG>Journal Club</STRONG></A></P><P><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/FP"><STRONG>Final Project</STRONG></A></P><P><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week1"><STRONG>Xcode Tutorial(week 1)</STRONG></A></P><P><STRONG>Biosearch section1(week2,3)</STRONG></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week2">week 2</A></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week3">week 3</A></P><P><STRONG>Biosearch section2(week4,5)</STRONG></P><P><A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week4&amp;5"><STRONG>week4~5</STRONG></A></P><P><STRONG>Tinker Cell(week,6,7)</STRONG></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week6">week 6</A></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week7">week 7</A></P><P><STRONG>Comprehensive work</STRONG></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week8">week 8</A></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week9">week 9～12</A></P><P>  <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-A/week13">week 13～18</A></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><TABLE width="899" border="0" cellspacing="7px" cellpadding="7px" align="center"><TBODY><TR><TD><DIV><UL><LI>week 10</LI></UL><P>    In the past four days, our team members have made several noticeable progresses.
