Projects
Our projects include Biosearch and Biodesign. Biosearch is an iPhone app which substantially increases the efficiency of searching biobricks in partsregistry.org. Biodesign is a graphics editing application specific to synthetic biology for both iPhone and iPad. Both of them combine efficiency with portability, showing that a new era of mobile biology researching is coming.

Biodesign: Draft Bio-Circuit with Your Fingers!
Biodesign is our second software project on iPhone.
  To design a picture like the right one, which tool would you like to choose? Windows drawing tool? You must be kidding! Tinkcell? Yes, you are approaching it. How about using your iPhone? Yes, you can draw a biological circuit like the right one on your iPhone with BioDesign,

  Biodesign is a graphics editing application specific to synthetic biology for iPhone. It is based on a previous iGEM software named Tinkercell and was elaborately improved to adapt to mobile platform. It provides hundreds of biobrick icons as well as a great many fancy functions including dragging graphics, drawing curves and automatically connecting figures with corresponding arrows. With BioSearch, users are capable of drawing biochemical reaction schematics anywhere they want and share their drawings with friends wherever they like!
  The major graphics editing interface is shown below.

  Since the first version of our BioDeisgn has already been finished, you will find it on APP Store soon!
  We have to notice that an era of cell phone is coming! And since the download times on AppStore is more than 25 billion (see right), iPhone has become one of the most essential mobile platforms. Our core concept is to make research portable. When the development of other disciplines still depends on paper documents or network data, synthetic biology has come to the forefront of the time.From now on, synthetic biology is no longer a discipline limited in laboratory , researchers can take it walking in every corner of the world, to show the charm of synthetic biology to the whole world!
