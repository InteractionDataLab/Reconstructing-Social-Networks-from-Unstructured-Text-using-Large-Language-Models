Projects
Our projects include Biosearch and Biodesign. Biosearch is an iPhone app which substantially increases the efficiency of searching biobricks in partsregistry.org. Biodesign is a graphics editing application specific to synthetic biology for both iPhone and iPad. Both of them combine efficiency with portability, showing that a new era of mobile biology researching is coming.

Help New Students
    We spent 3 days, 17th October to 19th Ocober, to help our school to receive new students. Thus we had to pause our project for a while.
    
    There are 3 railway stations in Shenzhen. They are Shenzhen west station, Shenzhen north station and Shenzhen station. Most new students get off the train at Shenzhen station. Since our school locates far from those 3 stations. We decided to send school bus to the station to pick up the freshmen. The earliest train arrived at 5:00am. So we had to get up at 4:00am and then spent one hour to the station. It was really exhausting those days.
    
    Though tired, we were still very happy.
