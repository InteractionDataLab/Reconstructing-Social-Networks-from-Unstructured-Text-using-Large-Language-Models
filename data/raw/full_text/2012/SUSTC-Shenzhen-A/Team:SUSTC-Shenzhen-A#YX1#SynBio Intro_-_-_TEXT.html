Introduction to Synthetic Biology
  Synthetic biology is an area of biology which aims on reforming and creating genes to let them function in expected ways, constructing new biological functions and systems that are not found in nature. The former focuses on synthesizing gene fragments, inserting artificial DNA into living cells and enabling them to express rightly; while the latter majors in rewriting natural systems, and building a new biological system as a platform for many technologies.
 
  Our instructor Prof.He gave students an splendid presentation to inspire their interest in synthetic biology.
