The weekly notebook includes the work process of every teammate everyday. Here you can see the detailed steps of finishing the two projects for iGEM competition, and go through the days that our projects grow up with us together.
 
Week2
7.16
    We chose mySQL as our database management system for its search functions. A program which could connect mySQL database and load data as well as using mySQL's search funcions was gotten.  .
7.17
    In the first meeting, our group divided into two parts:UI(part leader: Xiao Tong)& data(part leader:Mubing Zhou). UI members and data members works in pair. All the members made a draft of our project one--Bosearch and looked through partsregistry.org part by part carefully, so that we could choice the functions needed.
7.18
    In this day we determined three parts of our work: categories, search engine, and search result. We also disgusted the search methods. From now, all the members started our group-work with clear aims.
    Search Engine group included two members: Xiao Tong and Mubing Zhou. Their main work was to search keywords (or some other functions) which were input by user in the database and passed the summarized results to them. When user clicked one of the results for more details, the part-name was sent to Search Result group.
    Search Result group included six members: group leader Xin Yang, Deng Pan, Jingyao Guo, Qijia Cheng, Yidan Pan, Yujun Zhao. The main goal of this group was to create an interface to accept the result(part name) of bio-brick searching (which was sent by the SE group),showing the details of this part. In this part, loading database was the most important thing .
    Category group included four members: Chenchen Lv, Junqiu Zhang, Yiqi Jiang and Zili Fan. They would work on building category-formed-interface to show all the data in partsregistry.org, which simplifys the long spreadsheet into keyword-showing tables.

7.19
  SE：Members discussed about the searching methods and searchstring. A picker was chosen for user to select the searching part(part name, discription and so on).
  Xiao Tong: Designed the user interface included the form of spinner and the options it showed.
  Mubing Zhou: Tested the search methods (accurate search and fuzzy search).
  
  Category：Analyzing the target website, members determined to provide four kinds of showing type:parts by type;parts by function; parts by chassis and devices by type. Then members collected informations and codes ,in order to show a user friendly interface.
  Chenchen Lv:Attempted category's overall arrangement as table-formed.
  Junqiu Zhang: Designed the tone of category view.
  Yiqi Jiang: Attempted category's overall arrangement as folder-formed.
  Zili Fan: Designed the tone of category view.
  
  Search result: The team in charge of the database started to analyse the mysql files and collect all the titles. By comparing the database and the website, we found that the database was incomplete, which didn't contain the description written by different authors, and the structure was totally different from the website. In order to build a part-name-based search result, we needed to search the whole database again when SE returned us the part name and collected the result.
  Xin Yang: Selected important parts of the 13 tables.
  Deng Pan: Designed the interface of search result
  Jingyao Guo: Tried to show details from several tables in one page as table form.
  Qijia Cheng:on vacation
  Yidan Pan: Tried to show details from several tables in one page as table form.
  Yujun Zhao: Tested to combine all the tables of the database.
  
7.20
  SE：he primary searching method was confirmed as fuzzy search --it meaned if you typed "BBa_" and selected "part name", the program would give you a result of all the biobricks whose part name included "BBa_". At this time, the database included 13 different parts. For its complex structure , the keyword needed to be searched in all 13 tables.
  Xiao Tong:Test different styles of search interface.
  Mubing Zhou: Tested fuzzy search to search all the tables at the same time.
  
  Category：Members tested different kinds of appearances. They decided to show a similized table first, whose content was the same as the website. When clicked the table, more informations would be shown.
  Chenchen Lv:took a vacation.
  Junqiu Zhang: tested the descriptions' displaying form.
  Yiqi Jiang: Attempted category's overall arrangement as folder-formed.
  Zili Fan: Designed the view of part "list".
  
  Search result:
Database part:Our instructor Dr. He gave us the XML form data which was provided by partsregistry.org itself. Therefore our focus of work changed to "analyzing the xml file and saving it as a SQL file".We tested two methods: used Excel to load the xml file, saved as xls file, then changed it to mySQL (which was managed by Qijia Cheng and Yidan Pan);directly used load function of mysql to get data from xml file and saved in mySQL(which was managed by Xin Yang and Yujun Zhao).
UI part: Jingyao Guo and Deng Pan designed the interface of the search result in table form. But since the different structure of two databases needed different code to read, all we needed was to confirm WHICH DATABASE TO USE!
  Xin Yang: Attempted to load XML through Xcode.
  Deng Pan: Designed the interface of detailed result when user clicked the result table.
  Jingyao Guo:Attempted to list all the parts in search result.
  Qijia Cheng:Attempted to translate XML file to excel.
  Yidan Pan: Attempted to translate file from excel to mySQL .
  Yujun Zhao:Learned the usage of mySQL.
  
7.21
  SE：The interface was totally changed. The picker was changed by several input fields, including part name, category, direction and length. And more options could be added if user needed.
  Xiao Tong:Tested different input fields, designed the SE interface.
  Mubing Zhou:Tested fuzzy search with both keywords and field limitation.
  
  Category：After discussion, testing various styles, members decided to use folder form. Besides, every secondary part was devided into two section:description and list. Description was the introduction of the secondary title(eg. promoter), when the table was touch and list was the collection of all the biobrick in this category.
  Chenchen Lv:Tested different styles of color matching.
  Junqiu Zhang: Designed the descriptions' displaying form.
  Yiqi Jiang:Achieved the folder form with four categories.
  Zili Fan:Took a vacation.
  
  Search result: BIG NEWS HAPPENED!The problem of loading xml had been mainly broken through this night, by changing some words of the xml file and loading the changed-version directly through mySQL, we could easily get part-name-based data from our database.With this optimized new database, UI group could test the work with high efficiency!
  Xin Yang:Mainly succussed in loading XML through mySQL, but some parts could not be loaded if their content was empty.
  Deng Pan: Designed the interface of search result
  Jingyao Guo:  Listed all the parts in search result by writing 40 cases.
  Qijia Cheng:Attempted to show a demo of our project user interface.
  Yidan Pan: Attempted to translate file from excel to mySQL .
  Yujun Zhao:Mainly succussed in loading XML through mySQL by changing some words.
  
7.22
  SE：For the database was totally updated, all the works came down to data need to redo.Using the original database, the data needed to be searched twice in the whole process. First, when users type the keyword and clicked "search", all the tables were searched with this keyword to get the biobrick, then sended the part name to search result part. Then the second search took place when the search result part got the part name. The partn ame was searched in all the tables to give user a detailed page of this biobrick's information. In short, the tables needed to be searched by keyword and the part name.But with this renewed database, we could search in only one table.
  Xiao Tong:Attempted to choose the fields could be selected.
  Mubing Zhou:Rewrote the program of fuzzy searching, debug.
  
  Category：This new database greatly simplified list forming. All the informations could be found in a single, huge table.
  Chenchen Lv:Attempted to show the similized table.
  Junqiu Zhang:Filled the content of description.
  Yiqi Jiang: Modify the composing.
  Zili Fan:Attempted to show the similized table.
  
  Search result: BIG NEWS HAPPENED!The problem of loading xml had been mainly broken through this night, by changing some words of the xml file and loading the changed-version directly through mySQL, we could easily get part-name-based data from our database.With this optimized new database, UI group could test the work with high efficiency!
  Xin Yang:Added "Null" to parts without content in XML in order to fix the problem.
  Deng Pan:  Debug the animation of showing details.
  Jingyao Guo:Combined the search result page with page showing details which was too long to show in table.
  Qijia Cheng:Attempted to show a demo of our project user interface.
  Yidan Pan: Attempted to translate files from excel to SQLite.
  Yujun Zhao:Took a vacation.
