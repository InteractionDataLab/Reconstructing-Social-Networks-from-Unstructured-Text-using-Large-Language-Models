  Team Introduction
  
  
  We are the iGEM team from SUSTC (South University of Science and Technology of China): SUSTC-Shenzhen-A. This team is instructed by a professor and an advisor, and is composed by twelve sophomores.The average age of our team is about 18 years old and we are probably the youngest team in iGEM 2012! We come from all major fields, but we all have great enthusiasm towards synthetic biology. Our team spirit is unremitting exploration to the unknown.
  
  
  
  Instructor
  Jiankui He
  
  
  Dr. Jiankui He is an associate professor at SUSTC. Dr. He got his PhD degree in Physics at Rice University in Houston Texas in 2010 and did his postdoc at Stanford University.
  Dr. He's lab employs interdisciplinary methods in physics, chemistry, and statistics to study biological systems at both cellular and genetic level. Current research focuses on genomic, human genetic diseases, immunology, system biology and synthetic biology. Labwebiste: www.sustc-genome.org.cn
  
  
 
  Student Members
  
Captain:Xiao Tong
  
  I'm Sydney, major in physics.Proud of being a crazy guy with fantastic thoughts fulling my mind. Hope that one day I can find myself achieving beyond my imagination in both physics and literature.
  I truly enjoy the iGEM experience this summer and love biology much more than before.There's no doubt that our hardwork will get us what we deserve.
  
  
  
Mubing Zhou
  
  My name is Mubing Zhou who is a 19-year-old boy and studying in SUSTC. I'm interested in maths and computer science and, of course, synthetic biology.
  I clearly know that today's biology is quite different from the old day's. And computers are contributing more and more to the biological researches. Though I am a amateur programmer, I love writing codes. Besides, I hope our software can surprise everyone.
  
  
  
Chenchen Lv
  
  I'm Levia! A girl with great eagerness in biology research. Also I have intense interest in Computer Science. And this is why I come to the iGEM competition. Despite i'am a little lazy,I will try my best to do the work which I promised to finish.
  
  
  
Deng Pan
  
  I am Pan Deng, member of SUSTC-ShenZhen-A iGEM team , friends aways call me Panda. You may have noticed that there are two pandas in this team . Never mind, you are really not browsing the zoo’s webpage.
  Actually at very first, I was working on the iPad version of BioSearch App, but for some reason(maybe I was too lazy.), I have not finished the user interface design. But the database works well, our team drop the Mysql database which we set up before and substitute by Sqlite.
  
  
  
Jingyao Guo
  
  
  Student, like reading and painting more than studying. Silent in the crowd but crazy when with friends. Thought to be a quiet girl, but love heavy metal music and swords. I'm Guo Jingyao.
  
  
  
Junqiu Zhang
  
   Love life, love all the wonderful things in the world
   Love art, but love physics more.
   Love bowknot, always love bowknot.
   Detective story is my favorite.
   I am not gluttonous, I just pretend to be gluttonous.
   I am not lolita, I am Zhang Junqiu.
  
  
  
Qijia Cheng
  
  I am Qijia Cheng,I am an iPhone user and developer in my spare time.
  I want our BioSearch app to be perfect and can be very useful for synthetic biology researchers.
I like football.
  
  
  
Xin Yang
  
  I’m a 2nd year undergraduate aiming to major in chemistry at SUSTC. I Have been interested in Synthetic Biology since I joined SUSTC’s iGEM journal club in March. I’m responsible for the database of our iPhone Application together with Zhao Yujun, and write the framework of the most rudimentary interface of our software. Later, I’m called to assist Pan Yidan with our wiki and master parts of human practice work. When I’m not working, I tend to go swimming under the sunshine or to paint in the lounge.
  
  
  
Yidan Pan
  
  I'm Panda, likely to be the mascot of our team (But the only part of bamboo I eat is bamboo shoot). I'm a gourmet and I love food very much. As a "director" of our support services, managing to supply a good work environment are my duties. Both biology and biont are my favorite, besides, both sleeping and reading are my interests.
  My main work is editing wiki, and what you see is the fourth edition of our wiki. May you enjoy our work!
ps. There is another Panda in our group!
  
  
  
Yiqi Jiang
  
  My name is Jiang Yiqi. I enjoy all the things related to biology, want to defeat cancer in the future. The igem game is the first time that I can be so close to the advanced biology. I am so lucky to have the chance to attend this game. The process to do our project, buliding app softwares, is interesting. I learned so much and had a wonderful experienemt. Through this competition, I have a better understanding of synthetic biology. I hope in the future that my dreams come true maybe by the methods of synthetic biology.

  Advisors
  
Rui Zhao
  
  Rui Zhao got his bachelor degree and master degree in Tsinghua University, majored in applied mathematics. His research interests mainly focus on computational and bioinformatics.  He joined in the South University of Science and Technology of China last year then participated this iGEM program.
  
  
  Volunteers in human practice
  
Eric Zhang
  
  I graduated from Shenzhen Foreign Language School in 2012, is working for SUSTC iGEM Team in Human Practice Project. Since I've been in the SFLS Media Centre for two years, I'm interested in the propaganda of iGEM. Besides, I also like Computer Science and Physics. I'll be glad to find if someone has the same interests.
