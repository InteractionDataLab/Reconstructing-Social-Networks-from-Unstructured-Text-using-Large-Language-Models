Projects
Our projects include Biosearch and Biodesign. Biosearch is an iPhone app which substantially increases the efficiency of searching biobricks in partsregistry.org. Biodesign is a graphics editing application specific to synthetic biology for both iPhone and iPad. Both of them combine efficiency with portability, showing that a new era of mobile biology researching is coming.

  Bronze Medal
Register the team, have a great summer, and plan to have fun at the Jamboree.
  We registered our team as SUSTC-Shenzhen-A,enjoyed our great summer and autumn , and we're planning to having fun at the Asia Jamboree!
  
Successfully complete and submit this iGEM 2012 Judging form.

Develop and make available via The Registry of Software Tools an open source software tool that supports synthetic biology based on BioBrick standard biological parts.
   For our download page of Biosearch, please click here .
  
  
  Sliver Medal
Provide a detailed, draft specification for the next version of your software tool.
  Our next version of Biosearch is in the future plan. Please click here for more details.
  
Provide a second, distinct software tools project.
   Our second software is Biodesign, a distinct iPhone app which enables you draft the cell in your pocket!.Please click here for details!
  
  
  Gold Medal
Have another team utilize the software developed by your team.
  
  Eight iGEM teams utilized our software in their projects, including Tianjin, SJTU-BioX-Shanghai, OUC-China,Tsinghua ,HKUST ,SUSTC-Shenzhen-B, SUSTC-Shenzhen-A. They gave us a number of detailed user experiences and valuable comments. For more details, please click User Review .
  
Outline and detail how your project effects Human Practice in Synthetic Biology.Such topics include: safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
  
  Safety issues (including safety, security, ethics,etc), as a team which devoted ourselves to iPhone app development, we didn’t create any lab product. For more information , please click Safety .
  Sharing: With our Biosearch on your iPhone, you can check Biobricks and partsregistry in the seminar room; You can design your genetic circuits when you are waiting for a bus! Biosearch created a user friendly interface and wide using range, enable users to search Biobricks with high efficiency almost everywhere! With local database, users can use Biosearch without connecting internet, making the information of synthetic biology become much easier to get!
  Innovation: Our Biosearch creatively shows and confirms that iPhone can be, and will be an important tool in biology research for its portability. In our human practice, we aim to investigate how an iPhone aids biologists in the lab.
    Want to know more about how our Biosearch effects Human Practice in Synthetic Biology,  please click here .
  
Develop a new standard, develop and document a new technical standard that supports the sharing BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA, or as information via the Internet.
  
  We developed a new technical standard: BBF RFC 89 which described the minimum information that a qualified BioBrick should have. There was a BBF RFC 52 before, but as the database is getting larger and larger, a more detailed description is in urgent need.Our RFC 89 will replace the former RFC 52, because it is more precise, and it will surely help to standardize the development of BioBricks. The details can be found in RFC draft .
  
  
Best Interaction with the Parts Registry
  
Propose an alternate interaction with the registry. Clearly document this on your wiki in a page explicitly dedicated to this aspect of your tool. You should clearly show how to use this tool in a design flow used by experimental iGEM teams.
"Biobrick Search" propose an alternate interaction with the registry.  Detailed explanations are here.  Also, Collaboration page shows how this tool was used by an experimental team, UT-Tokyo.
