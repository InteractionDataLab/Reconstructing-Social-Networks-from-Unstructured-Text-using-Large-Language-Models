Projects
Our projects include Biosearch and Biodesign. Biosearch is an iPhone app which substantially increases the efficiency of searching biobricks in partsregistry.org. Biodesign is a graphics editing application specific to synthetic biology for both iPhone and iPad. Both of them combine efficiency with portability, showing that a new era of mobile biology researching is coming.

Background
    Registry of Standard Biological Parts is a website that provides a collection of biological parts with known functions used in synthetic biology, ranging from plasmids to protein generators. The parts conform to BioBrick standard and form a categorization system so that new genetic parts can be simply constructed through hierarchy implement. Based on the "get some, to give some" principle, the continuous improvement of resource and cooperation among researchers is achieved. The active role of the website in promoting the development of synthetic biology is self-evident. On the other hand, the ubiquitous mobile device shows that traditional websites cannot satisfy our needs to update data and disseminate the information timely. A client on mobile devices seems necessary. According to statistical data, the user amount of iPhone is rather huge, which implies that iPhone client might be an excellent choice.
  
  
Motivation
  Nowadays, the focal point of electronic devices is shifting from the fixed to portable, people use mobile devices in routine to save time. With a nice appearance and the support of APP store , which is the biggest market for smartphone applications, iPhone attracts a huge amount of consumers, and is becoming an important office platform. However, the Registry of Standard Biological Parts website does not fit the operating system of iPhone. Therefore, considering the wide range of users of iPhone, and to benefit those who are interested in or working in synthetic biology, we’re going to build and improve a search engine of BioBricks.
  
  
Expected Results
  As shown in the figures, two ways will be provided to search BioBricks .
  The first method is a kind of web-of-knowledge-way searching technique which resembles the website www.webofknowledge.com. A common vocabulary for varied search terms related to BioBricks will be provided.Such terms are browsed by functions, browsed by types, etc. And users can choose the terms they need on their own. This will provide a powerful search function. The second way is a keyword-way search technique. This kind of search is simple yet quick. A keyword is input and a set of BioBricks with this key word is returned. We believe that users can find their target BioBricks quickly with the aid of these two search techniques.
  Besides, we hope that all of our members can enjoy the process of preparing and presenting our project.
