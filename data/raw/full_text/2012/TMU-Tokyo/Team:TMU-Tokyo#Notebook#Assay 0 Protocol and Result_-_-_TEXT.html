I. Assay of resistance for formaldehyde
1. Make mediums
Agar medium's recipe
Agar mediums
Dissolve parl  core agar medium 37.5 g into DW 200 ml.
Autoclave for 20 minutes at 121 °C.
Solution mediums
Dissolve glucose 2 g, polypeptone 2 g and yeast extract 2 into DW 200 ml.
Autoclave for 20 minutes at 121 °C.
Phosphate buffer
Make disodium hydrogen-phosphate aq 300 ml (0.2 M) and sodium
dihydrogenphosphate dihydrate aq 300 ml (0.2 M) for pH 6.8.
2. Cultivate E. coli in solution mediums for overnight.
3. Prepare 1ml 0.1 %, 1 %, 5 % and 10 % solution of formaldehyde and formate.
4. Add 1 μl E. coli into these solutions for 10 minutes.
5. Plate on an agar medium.
6. Incubate at 37 °C for overnight.
II. Additional experiment for formaldehyde
1. Prepare 1 ml 0.04 %, 0.08 %, 0.12 %, 0.16 % and 0.2 % of formaldehyde solution.
2. Add 1 μl E. coli into these solutions for 10 minutes.
3. Plate on an agar medium.
4. Incubate at 37 °C for overnight.
■Assay 0 Result
I.Result
E. coli could grow in every concentration of formate
E. coli could grow in 0.4 % solution of formaldehyde
