Notebook
We described detail about experiment, protocols, and assay.
■Experiment
Genetic recombination experiment we did is described. We divided the experiment plan to parts completion and some teams concentrated on allocated experiments.
■Protocols
We crated own protocols with reference to the previous experiments last year, researching both inside and outside the team. Additionally, we improve the researched protocols through our experiments. So our protocols described here is really reliable. It must be useful in your experiments.
■Assay
In order to confirm synthesized devices, we experimented functions of the devices using Escherichia coli transformed by plasmids inserted our devices.
