・Refine of PCR products of frmR and fdh4AB
Mixed 1 volume of sample with 2 volumes of Buffer NT.
Placed a NucleoSpin Extract II Column into a Collection Tube and loaded the sample. Centrifuged for 1 minute at 11,000 x g. Discarded flow-through and placed the column back into the collection tube.
Added 700 μl Buffer NT3 to the NucleoSpin Extract II Column. Centrifuged for 1 minute at 11,000 x g. Discarded flow-though and placed the column back into the collection tube.
Centrifuged for 2 minutes at 11,000 x g to remove Buffer NT3 completely.
Placed the NucleoSpin Extract II Column into a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Added 45 μl Buffer NE and incubated at room temperature for 1 minute. Centrifuged for 1 minute at 11,000 x g.
・Densitometry
Diluted DNA samples 50 times with a solvent.
Turned on the machine; GeneQuant 100.
Poured the solvent 100 μl into a cuvette and adjusted 0.
Threw the solvent, poured the DNA sample.
Measured the concentration.
・Results
Concentration of frmR: 85 ng/ µL, fdh4AB: 43 ng/ µL.
・Gel extraction
Excised the DNA fragment from an agarose gel. For each 100 mg of agarose gel added 200 μl Buffer NT.
Incubated sample for 5 – 10 minutes at 50 °C. Vortexed the sample briefly every 2 – 3 minuets until the gel slice was completely dissolved.
Placed a NucleoSpin Extract II Columu into a Collection Tube and loaded the sample. Centrifuged for 1 minute at 11,000 x g. Discarded flow-through and placed the column back into the collection tube.
Added 700 μl Buffer NT3 to the NucleoSpin Extact II Column. Centrifuged for 1 minute at 11,000 x g. Discarded flow-through and placed the column back into the collection tube.
Centrifuged for 2 minutes at 11,000 x g to remove Buffer NT3 completely.
Placed the NucleoSpin Extract II Column into a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Added 50 μl Buffer NE and incubated at room temperature for 1 minute. Centrifuged for 1 minute at 11,000 x g.
