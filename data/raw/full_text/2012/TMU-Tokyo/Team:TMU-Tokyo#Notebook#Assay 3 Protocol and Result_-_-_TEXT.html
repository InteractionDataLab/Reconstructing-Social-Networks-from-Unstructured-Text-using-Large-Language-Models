■Assay3 Protocol
Ⅰ. Extraction of the crude enzyme solution
1. The cells were cultured at 30 ℃ for 18 hours in medium
2. Centrifuged 10000 × g 5min
3. Remove the supernatant
4. Wash the fungus
Add dw and Centrifuged 10000 × g 5min
5. Remove the supernatant
6. E. coli disrupted by sonicator in buffer of 50mM Tris-HCl pH7.2 .
7. Centrifuged 11000 × g at 4 ℃ so that the enzyme is not deactivated, the supernatant was harvested as crude enzyme solution (If you want to save is stored at 4 ℃ in a cold room)
The reaction mixture are 50mM Tris-HCl ph7.2 0.8ml
There sodium formate 20mM 0.1ml (2mM final concentration)
20mM NAD + 0.1ml
Incubated for 5 minutes at 37 ℃ put
I was allowed to react at 37 ℃ in the next, put 0.05ml crude enzyme solution.
Formic acid formic acid was quantified through the reaction mixture liquid chromatography.
