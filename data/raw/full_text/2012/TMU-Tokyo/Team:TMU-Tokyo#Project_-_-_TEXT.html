What's Chef Ant E. coli ?
 
 
Our project Chef Ant E. coli is to append abilities to detoxify formaldehyde to Escherichia coli.
Following is a simple explanation of our project. If you want more academic explanation, visit Abstract or each device page.
■Background
Formaldehyde is a common harmful chemical, and it has a bad effect in relatively low concentration. (For example, in agricultural chemicals, in disinfectant at hospitals and in paint of building materials)
Also, since fromaldehyde is mass-produced in factories, it is highly possible to exceed over the permissible amount in the environment. These days, in Japan, the detection of formaldehyde in Tone river became an issue.
■Devices
We planed to create E.coli which removes such a hazardous material, named Chef Ant E.coli. It is appended 3 devices and gets removal ability of formaldehyde.
More genetic information about Chef Ant E. coli is available in project abstract .
