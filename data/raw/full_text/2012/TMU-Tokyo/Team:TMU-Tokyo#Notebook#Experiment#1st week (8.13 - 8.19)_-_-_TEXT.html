・Digestion
1. Mixed following: total 20µL
(DW 15µL / DNA solution 2µL / 10x L buffer 2µL / SacI 1µL;)
2. Incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour.
3. Heat inactivated at 65 °C for 10 minutes.
4. Mixed: Total 50µL
(DW 24µL / Reaction solution 20µL / 10x K buffer 5µL / BamHI 1µL;)
5. Incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour 40 minutes.
・Electrophoresis
Put an agalose gel into the tank, and poured TBE buffer.
Mixed DNA samples: loading buffer = 9: 1. Loaded samples into wells.
Electrophoresed, stopped when samples move to 2/3.
・Gel extraction
Excised the DNA fragment from an agarose gel. For each 100 mg of agarose gel added 200µL Buffer NT.
Incubated sample for 5 – 10 minutes at 50 C. Vortexed the sample briefly every 2 – 3 minuets until the gel slice was completely dissolved.
Placed a NucleoSpin Extract II Columu into a Collection Tube and loaded the sample. Centrifuged for 30 seconds at 11,000x g. Discarded flow-through and placed the column backed into the collection tube.
Added 700µL Buffer NT3 to the NucleoSpin Extact II Column. Centrifuged for 30 s at 11,000x g. Discarded flow-through and placed the column backed into the collection tube.
Centrifuged for 1 min at 11,000x g to remove Buffer NT3 completely.
Placed the NucleoSpin Extract II Column into a new 1.5 ml microcetrifuge tube. Added 30µL Buffer NE and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Centrifuged for 1 min at 11,000x g.
・Densitometry
Diluted DNA samples 50 times with a solvent.
Turned on the machine; GeneQuant 100.
Poured the solvent 100µL into a cuvette and adjusted 0.
Threw the solvent, poured the DNA sample.
Measured the concentration.
・Results
Concentration of a back bone plasmid was 53 ng /μl.
We could not obtain the target fragments of fdh4AB.
■16th Aug
(Construction of Device3)

・Refine of PCR products: fdh4AB and Backbone plasmid
Mixed 1 volume of sample with 2 volumes of Buffer NT.
Placed a NucleoSpin Extract II Column into a Collection Tube and loaded the sample. Centrifuged for 30 s at 11,000x g. Discarded flow-through and placed the column back into the collection tube.
Added 700µL Buffer NT3 to the NucleoSpin Extract II Column. Centrifuged for 30 s at 11,000x g. Discarded flow-though and placed the column back into the collection tube.
Centrifuged for 1 minute at 11,000x g to remove Buffer NT3 completely.

Electrophoresis of PCR products: before digestion of fdh4AB, after PCR products clean-up of fdh4AB, before PCR products clean-up of fdh4AB and diluted 100 times of PCR products of fdh4AB.
Put an agalose gel into the tank, and poured TBE buffer.
Mixed DNA samples: loading buffer = 9: 1. Loaded samples into wells.
Electrophoresed, stopped when samples move to 2/3.
