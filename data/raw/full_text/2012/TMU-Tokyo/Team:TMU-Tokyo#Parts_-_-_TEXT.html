Other parts are described in Parts Registry.
Formaldehyde monitoring and dehydrogenate device. The upstream is sensor for formaldehyde using frmR from Escherichia coli ( Device1 ) and the downstream consecutively produces PFDH, formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida ( Device2 ).
BBa_K749025, by itself, enables to observe the degree of formaldehyde decomposition with the naked eye.
Formate dehydrogenase device. BBa_K749015 produces formate dehydrogenase 4 from Methylobacterium extorquens consecutively ( Device3 ).
Complete formaldehyde detoxification is realized by only BBa_K749025 and BBa_K749015.
Upstream of BBa_K749025, formaldehyde sensor. we use BBa_K749021 in assay for frmR inhibitory.
