・PCR of insert (fdh4AB), electrophoresis
→Failure: because of too dilute bands
・PCR of insert (fdh4AB), electrophoresis
→Failure: because of annealing temperature
・PCR of insert (fdh4AB), electrophoresis
→Success: We observed appropriate bands!
・Electrophoresis of PCR products: before digestion of fdh4AB, after PCR products
1.Put an agalose gel into the tank, and poured TBE buffer.
2.Mixed DNA samples : loading buffer = 9 : 1. Loaded samples into wells.
3.Electrophoresed stopped when samples move 2/3.
