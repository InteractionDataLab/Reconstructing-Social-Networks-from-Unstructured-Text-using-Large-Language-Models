・Densitometry of backbone plasmids
1. Diluted DNA samples 50 times with a solvent
2. Turned on the machine; GeneQuant 100
3. Poured the solvent 100 μl into a cuvette and adjusted 0
4. Threw the solvent, poured the DNA sample
5. Measured the concentration
・Results
Concentration of backbone plasmid no.1: 18 ng/ μl, no.2: 5 ng/ μl.
