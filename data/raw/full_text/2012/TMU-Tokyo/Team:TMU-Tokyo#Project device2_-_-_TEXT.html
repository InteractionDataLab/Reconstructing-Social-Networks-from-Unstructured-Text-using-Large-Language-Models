Device2;
Producing formaldehyde dehydrogenase, changing formaldehyde to formate
 
 
This device is composed of formaldehyde dehydrogenase in Pseudomonas putida (PFDH) gene and the strongest constitutive promoter ( BBa_J23100 ), the srtongest RBS ( BBa_B0034 ). The reason we don't use repressor like frmR is to increase resistance of formaldehyde. We use the same strategy in device3 to increase resistance of formate.
Escherichia coli has original formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH), but it depends on glutathione existence. Instead of it, we found glutathione-independent FDH in Pseudomonas putida (PFDH). Formaldehyde dehydrogenase changes formaldehyde to formate. (HCHO → HCOOH)
The reason we didn't select Escherichia coli's own FDH is that glutathione-independent one can act in much more situations. For example, if Cheff Ant E.coli dies, Escherichia coli's own FDH loses its substrate because of glutathione absence. FDH and PFDH are homologous and their sequences are well preserved.
In additon to the glutathione-independence, PFDH can be increased its activity by a few amino acids mutation. It was measured that the activity increased 1.7 times stronger.
