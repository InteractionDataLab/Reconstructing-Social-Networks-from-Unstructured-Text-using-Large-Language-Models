(Construction of Device2)
・PCR of insert (FDH)
・Electrophoresis
→Failure: because of a lot of smear
・Ordered Device1 and Device2 plasmids arrive!
Electrophoresis of PCR products: before digestion of fdh4AB.
1. Put an agalose gel into the tank, and poured TBE buffer.
2. Mixed DNA samples : loading buffer = 9 : 1. Loaded samples into wells.
