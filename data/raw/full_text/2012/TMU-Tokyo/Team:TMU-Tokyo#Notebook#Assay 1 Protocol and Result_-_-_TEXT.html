■Assay1 Protocol
1. In LB medium (liquid), wound bacteria frm-GFP, were incubated for 6 hours at room shaking culture.
2. Was placed 5μl (0.04%) formalin solution to take the sample tube 500μl culture was diluted 200-fold there.
3.4 Degrees, I was centrifuged for 2 minutes at 120rpm
4. Supernatant was removed, I was vortexed
5. Put on the preparations taking 3μl from the tube, I observed a cover glass.
6. I observed as a control those that do not contain formaldehyde.
■Assay1 Result
GFP expression was not observed either. 50 times, 100 times, 400 times, 600 times, 800 times, created in 1000-fold diluted solution of the same procedure, but I was the same experiment, the expression of GFP was not observed either.
