Sponsors
The Rose-Hulman iGEM team is proud and excited to announce AIT Bioscience as our generous sponsor and primary supporter. This expert contract research organization provides quantitative bioanalytical support for pre-clinical and Phase I through Phase III clinical trials.
MathWorks provided software for use by iGEM teams in their projects. The software package includes MATLAB and SimBiology, a computational systems biology tool ideal for modeling the processes studied in iGEM projects.
AutoDesk is another sponsor of iGEM teams. Autodesk's software Molecular Maya allows users to build and animate molecular structure models and is being utilized by the team to animate the kinase pathway.
Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology provided the laboratory and work spaces for the iGEM team, as well as providing on-campus housing for the students.
