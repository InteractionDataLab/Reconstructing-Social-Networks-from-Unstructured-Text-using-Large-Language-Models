Project Goal
The goal of our project is to prepare yeast strains that can easily be used to determine the mating type of other yeast haploids. Our constructs will employ a promoter active in the pheromone response pathway and a latch-type circuit to produce a fluorescent reporter protein when the pathway is activated. We hope our constructs will facilitate the progress of myriad researchers who use yeast as a model organism.
RHIT iGEM News
We are busy preparing for the Americas East competition in Pittsburgh on Oct. 13th!
