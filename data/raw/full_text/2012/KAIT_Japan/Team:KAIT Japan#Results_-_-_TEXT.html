Cytoplasmic Region of Tar
We did PCR so as to get cytoplasmic region of tar.We used primer with restriction.
Figure1.PCR production from BBa_J22010
enzyme tag EcoRⅠand PstⅠ We experimented as following.
1.restriction enzyme processing PCR production
2.ligation
3.transformation
4.culture on the LB nutrient medium and get colonies.
5.colony PCR and numbering colonies.
6.We did miniprep 1,2,4,5.this is colony number
Figure2.the colony having cytoplasmic region of tar
7.After miniprep,we did PCR by using VF2 and VR primer
8.All production can be seen the band of cytoplasmic region of tar. So,These miniprep production are tar parts.
cytoplasmic region of tar bp is varied. 900bp~1000bp
Figure3.PCR production by using VF and VR
Methylation Site of Tar
We did PCR so as to get methylation site of tar.We used primer with restriction
Figure1.PCR production from BBa_J22010
enzyme tag EcoRⅠand PstⅠ We experimented as following.
1.restriction enzyme processing PCR production
2.ligation
3.transformation
4.culture on the LB nutrient medium and get colonies.
5.colony PCR and numbering colonies.
6.We did miniprep 1,8,9,10.this is colony number
Figure2. the colony having methylation site of tar
7.After miniprep,we did PCR by using VF2 and VR primer
8.The part of red boxes production can be seen the band of methylation site of tar. So,These miniprep production are tar parts.
methylation site of tar is 690bp
