Synthetic CO2 biosensor
Our goal is to generate a bio-brick which indirectly detects atmospheric CO2 by noticing the compounds formed by the CO2 dissociation in water as result of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. This reaction is done almost instantly and it is used as a signal by distinct organisms like E.coli,associated in the regulation of emergency signaling. Also, an association of the H+/HCO3- ratio and the signaling pathway of adenilate cyclase has been seen. The employment of these genes with reporter proteins can be used to indirectly calculate the concentration of environmental CO2. The CO2 concentration depends on the partial pressure and the speed with it is assimilated by the liquid. The fastest it gets to the saturation point 5%, the higher is the CO2 concentration.
 
Pollution is a major problem in our society, especially on cities, where   the high population density and pollution are congregated. Actually   there are some methods for pollutants detection in soil and water, but   few methods are available for detecting air pollutants, this type of   contamination may seem less obvious, but is alike dangerous for human   health and life quality. One of the most released pollutants to the   atmosphere is carbon dioxide CO2, direct   product of fossil fuel combustion and mostly responsible for climate   change. Our goal is to generate a biobrick whose function is to   indirectly detect atmospheric CO2 by   detecting the compounds formed by the dissociation of  CO2 in water product of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase.  The enzyme carbonic anhydrease's reaction, in his reduced form is:
 
H2O + CO2 → HCO3- + H+
 
This is done almost instantly and is used as a signal by distinct organisms like E.coli. Also, an association of the HCO-3 ratio and the signaling pathway of adenilate cyclase has been seen. The utilization of these genes with reporter proteins can be used to indirectly calculate the concentration of environmental CO2 as a function of the partial pressure and the speed is assimilated by the liquid medium, the fastest it gets to the saturation point 5% the higher is the CO2 concentration. This is added to the effort of design a possible system for in situ air bioremediation applicable to cities and a campaign of awareness for the population about biology methods, specifically synthetic biology that can improve the quality of the environment and our lives without leaving aside the importance of conservation and environmental care. Our human practices are focus on that direction with workshops, scientific diffusion talks that promotes consciousness about the importance of the environmental care and its impact on synthetic biology.
