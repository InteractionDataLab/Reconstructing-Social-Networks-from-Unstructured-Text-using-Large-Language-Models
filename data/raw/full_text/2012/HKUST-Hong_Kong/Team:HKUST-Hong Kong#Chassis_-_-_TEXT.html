CHASSIS
Considering the  requirements of our project, Bacillus  subtilis, a Gram-positive model organism in lab study, is chosen to be the  chassis in our project. Its ideality can be illustrated in the following  aspects:
Safety
Safety issues concerning synthetic biology are always challenged, especially when it comes to the area of medical treatment. From bacteria  hosts to biowastes, the public has never ceased to raise worries. To ease concerns from the public, researchers try their  best to minimize biohazards involved in every step of their experiments. Regarding safety  issues, we, 2012 HKUST iGEM team, therefore chose to use B. subtilis, a non-pathogenic chassis.
Low degree of  virulence:
Inhabiting gut as a part normal flora, Bacillus subtilis is considered to be a  non-pathogenic organism to human. Rarely has infection case in human been  revealed resulting from B. subtilis. According  to Edberg (Edberg 1991), B. subtilis does  not produce significant quantities of extracellular enzymes or possess other  virulence factors that would predispose it to cause infection. In the other  word, B. subtilis possess low virulence to human and presents low risk of  adverse effects to human health.  
Establishment of  Integration vectors:
The discovery of natural integration  in Bacillus subtilis raised great  attention in the field of molecular genetics in 1978. Due to its natural  integration, a series of integration vectors for B. subtilis were designed later for different purposes. In our  project, we employed an integration vector not only because of its stability in B. subtilis but also because of its  advantage in safety. The employment of integration vector to some extent  minimizes the risk of antibiotic resistance spreading within the normal flora  in gut. In addition, since the exposure of BMP-2 to normal tissue can induce  adverse effect, integrating target genes into genome can reduce the chance of spreading  of BMP-2 gene through horizontal gene transfer and avoid non-specific drug  release in gut.
Protein secretion:
Comparing with E. coli, another commonly used  chassis in iGEM, Bacillus subtilis is  preferred because of its high capacity in secreting proteins to extracellular  environment. As a Gram-positive eubacteria, B.  subtilis lacks an outer membrane and only a layer of 10 to 50nm  peptidoglycan outside cytoplasmic membrane. Thus Bacillus  subtilis can secrete proteins directly into the extracellular environment. Since  we were aiming for bacterial secretion of BMP-2 out to the colon, this  property suits our purposes well. 
Peptide  displaying:
Lacking the outer membrane, Bacillus subtilis is ideal for peptide  displaying. The cell wall of B. subtilis is the surface of the bacterium and contains  approximately 9% of the total protein. The discovery and study in cell  wall-binding modules from cell wall-bound proteins provides an attractive tool  for surface display of peptide. (Pooley et al. 1996) Aiming to display the  tumor-binding peptide, RPMrel, on bacteria surface, we decided to take advantage  of the cell wall displaying system, LytC, in Bacillus subtilis. Thus, the ease of peptide displaying served as  one of our reasons to choose B. subtilis as our chassis.
Normal flora in  gut:
B.  subtilis not only exists widely in the nature, but also contributes to part of the normal flora  in gut. (Collin and Gibson 1999) Regarded as a probiotic, it has  been proved to have positive effects on patients suffering from gaseous symptom  (Corazza et al. 1992). Using B.  subtilis as our chassis, in theory, will not introduce any exotic species into gut as well.
