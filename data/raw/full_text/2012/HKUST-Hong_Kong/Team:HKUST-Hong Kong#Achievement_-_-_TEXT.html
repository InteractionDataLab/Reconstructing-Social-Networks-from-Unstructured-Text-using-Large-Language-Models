Achievement
Our iGEM journey has spanned the length of six months; from the day our project was first proposed in mid-March to the day we ended wet lab work in mid-September.
We are proud to say that within our three months of wet lab work we have achieved the following:
Successfully constructed the parts for displaying recognition peptide, RPMrel, on the cell wall of Bacillus  subtilis ( BBa_K733007 ).
Successfully constructed two parts for BMP2 synthesis and excretion using signaling peptides YbdN and YdjM  respectively ( BBa_K733016 , BBa_K733017 ).
Successfully constructed a cell growth inhibition device for regulating BMP2 production ( BBa_K733012 ).
Successfully characterized the low efficiency promoter Ptms which was used to drive the expression of antitoxin YdcD ( BBa_K733009 , BBa_K733018 ).
Successfully characterized a xylose-inducible promoter that was used to control the expression of BMP2 and toxin YdcE.
Successfully characterized the cell growth inhibition device.
