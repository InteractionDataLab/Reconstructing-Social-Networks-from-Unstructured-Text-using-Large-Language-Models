SUN Fei (Sara)
My name is Sun Fei but many of my colleagues usually refer to me as Sara. I am  currently a year 2 biology student. For me, iGEM is just like a canvas for a painter. It is a place where great ideas can be sketched on and further  colorized. It is the place where beauty of accidents and findings come together.  It is the place where I can use my hands to create my world.
Sean CARIM
Life fascinates me. So as an opportunity to do work related to controlling and engineering life, iGEM was too strong a temptation to resist. I feel fortunate to be working alongside a group of dedicated students who share my interests. As a year 2 Biology major I consider the technical aspects of iGEM a refreshing chance to observe science and engineering operating in parallel. I also appreciate it as a rigorous team activity allowing us to improve our understanding both on what it is to be human as well as the dynamics of the bacteria we manipulate. Over the past months I have joined my sub-group members in building our cell wall expression construct and have conducted interviews in accordance with our human practices plans.
CHAN Yak Nok (Cola)
My name is Chan Yat Nok Cola, a year 2 student majoring in biochemistry. For me, synthetic biology is an amazing field full of possibilities, mysteries and creativity. It always gives us lots of surprises and inspirations, not to mention the sense of achievement. Thanks to iGEM for providing a chance to work along with a group of people who all have one goal, and for creating a platform to learn with pain and fun. iGEM is really “beautiful” in nature.
Ka Chun MOK
I am Ka Chun Mok, a year 2 student studying Molecular Biomedical Sciences in HKUST. In retrospect, I am attracted by the fancy world of biology when I was a high school student. During that time, GM food research was standing in the front line of the scientific field. I was inspired by the magic of synthetic biology that can make many new strains of organisms which are beneficial for the community. After I joined HKUST, I finally have the chance to taste the beauty of synthetic biology by joining then iGEM team. Frankly speaking, doing iGEM is not just being a part of a competition, but also about enjoying the process of doing synthetic biology. Thanks to that, I am glad to be involved in such a meaningful activity.
SHI Tianxing
I am Shi Tianxing, a year 2 biology student in HKUST. I have always been looking forward to understand more about the life sciences, especially with a group of biology lovers. That’s why I am here in iGEM team to help carry out the whole project. Our sub-group has been working on the recognition and binding of B. subtilis to colon cancer cells throughout the summer months, and I have been deeply involved in the building of our sub-group’s constructs from the first day. I appreciate that iGEM provides us, science beginners, a great opportunity to explore the world of genetic engineering and to share our experience with our friends, family, and other members of society all over the world.
Carson LAM
Carson is currently a year 2 student under the Molecular Biomedical Sciences program. He participated as a member of the Target Binding Module sub-group.
LAI Ka On (Sapphire)
Sapphire is currently a year 2 student pursuing a Biochemistry major. She participated as a member of the Target Binding Module sub-group.
YU Lai Cheong (Chris)
I am Yu Lai Cheong. My major is Molecular Biomedical Sciences. I am a year 2 student. Thanks to iGEM, I have received a lot of opportunities to organize things, do research, and deal with problems.
Chelsilia TANZIL
My name is Chelsi, currently in my second year in HKUST studying biochemistry. Joining iGEM as a freshman has given me lots of experience and knowledge, which I probably will never get in any class. Throughout the summer I worked with Anti-tumor Molecule Secretion Module sub- group to work on constructs which can secrete BMP2, helped with characterization of Ptms, and was in charge of the completion of 2012 HKUST iGEM Poster.
Christopher LEE
I am Christopher Lee. I study Molecular Biomedical Sciences, and am currently a year 2 student. I would like to join iGEM because it is a golden opportunity for me to decide which experiments to conduct on which particular purpose. It helps me to think carefully and to learn how to convince others with the results obtained. How to think is much more important than how to do. It is easy to know how to do since lots of protocols are available. But iGEM provides me with an opportunity to learn how to think and how to design experiments so that the results of our experiments can convince others. That is a critical skill for all scientists. As an iGEM team member, I am responsible for protein characterization.
Ilona Christy UNARTA
I am a future Chemist, who is currently still a year 2 student. Joining iGEM team does not only teach me about what synthetic biology is, but also how powerful synthetic biology can be. Through iGEM, I learnt that synthetic biology could be used in many different ways to solve a lot of world problems; just like our project, which focuses on targeting colon cancer. In the HKUST iGEM team, I worked along with Anti-tumor Molecule Secretion Module sub-group’s members to construct the plasmid consisting of DNA sequence coding for signaling peptide of B. subtilis and Bmp2. I am also helping in the poster design team.
LI Yiming (Eric)
My name is Li Yiming. I am currently a second year biochemistry student. I wish to earn the experience in lab work and enjoy the teamwork when doing iGEM. In this project, I collaborated with my teammates to get B. subtilis synthesize and secrete the protein BMP2. Although we came across many unexpected difficulties, we always persisted in our goal together. Spending all my efforts in lab will be the most wonderful memory in my life.
WANG Yuqi
I am WANG Yuqi but you can call me Cosmos. As a freshman of biochemistry in the university, I have to swallow a bunch of new information this summer. However, iGEM is about teamwork, and the whole HKUST iGEM team creates a cheerful atmosphere. It allows me, along with other members, to learn, grow and shine.
GU Bida
My name is Bida Gu, currently a second year student in Division of Life Science, HKUST. Starting as a freshman, I have benefited greatly from our iGEM team. What I learned was not only lab techniques but also skills of management and communication. During the past several months, I have helped to build one promoter and characterize two promoters for our team. I hope that in the future I will be able to contribute more to the HKUST iGEM team so that more students will be able to appreciate the beauty of synthetic biology.
QI Yi
My name is Qi Yi. I am a biochemistry majoring student, currently in the second year of my study. I joined iGEM to learn how to do research and biological lab work. Throughout the summer I helped my teammates to work on the construction of BBa_K733009 and the characterization procedures of Regulation and Control Module sub-group
YU Xiaoying (Susie)
I am Yu Xiaoying, a year 1 Biochemistry student. My colleagues usually call me Susie. I was an iGEM Asia Jamboree helper last year. The two-day competition was exciting. I listened to several presentations and got the chance to communicate with other teams’ members. I was attracted by iGEM and decided to participate in it. The whole process is tough but fun. I learned a lot through the months of lab work and human practice work. It was the first time that I spent my days in the lab, planning and carrying out experiments. As an iGEMer you may have the same experience---after weeks of failure, a construct was finally made and confirmed to work. For me that is the most fascinating part of iGEM, of science. I worked on the construction of BBa_K733009, promoters-- Pveg, Ptms, Pxyl, device containing ydcD/ydcE, and human practice. I really enjoy working with my team and best wishes for our team in 2012 iGEM competition!
Leon LEE
My name is Leon Lee, a second year Electronic Engineering student. Well, sometimes I feel like a freak in the team. After all, how could it be possible that an Electronic student mess around with a bunch of biologists? Well, the reason is that they need someone to write their Wiki page. Programming has always been one of my interests, and it is a great pleasure for me to design our Wiki page.
