Design - Module
Target Binding Module
Our decision to pursue colorectal carcinoma suppression arose from two key points obtained from preliminary research: 1) bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) suppresses the growth of colon cancer cell growth in vivo, and 2) the phage display peptide RPMrel confers specific and preferential binding to non-differentiated colon cancer cells......

Anti-tumor Molecule Secretion Module
As our team objective is to provide a specific and efficient drug delivery for Colon cancer, ivestigating and designing the way of drug synthesis and releasing is a significant part of our whole project. Hence this module is focusing on the production and delivery of anti-tumor drug...... click to see more
Regulation and Control Module
Our module aims at regulating the growth of our engineered bacteria B. hercules and the production of the anti-tumor drug, BMP2. We first introduce a xylose inducible promoter, which can help us control the timing of anti-tumor drug expression and secretion. Our choice of xylose as an inducer stems from its induction efficiency, its little existence and low absorption rate in colon...... click here to see more
