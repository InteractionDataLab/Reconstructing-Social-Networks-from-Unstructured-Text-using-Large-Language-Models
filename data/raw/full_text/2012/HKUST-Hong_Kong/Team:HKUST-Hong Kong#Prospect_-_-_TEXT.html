EXPECTATION
Through assembly of the target binding  module, anti-tumor drug synthesis module and regulatory module, we would to  introduce our genetically engineered Bacillus subtilis, B. hercules, as an  anti-colon-tumor agent to provide direct tumoricidal effect during cancer  therapy. It is applied as oral medicine which retains viability through  digestive tract and executes anti-tumor activity when and only when it is  binding to colon cancer cell.
Driven by pVeg constitutive promoter,  RPMrel, the colon-tumor specific peptide will be displayed on the cell wall of  B. hercules under the facilitation of LytC cell wall displaying system before  it is orally intake. When B. Hercules is taken orally by patient, it is  expected to reach colon after 8 hours without  retaining or colonizing in gastrointestinal tract. However, once it reaches  colon, it will be held up around colon tumor cells and colonize around them, waiting  for signal to produce anti-tumor molecule, BMP2 to the local environment.
Since  the expression of BMP2 is controlled by xylose inducible promoter and no xylose  is present in colon, xylose is taken orally or injected from anus to induce the  production of BMP2 when B. Hercules has successfully localized around colon  tumor. The locally concentrated BMP2 is expected to suppress colon tumor grow  and trigger the apoptosis of tumor while the low level BMP2 in colon introduces  as little adverse effect as possible to normal colon tissues.
When  BMP2 is intensively produced under the inducing from xylose, controlling by the  same promoter, the expression of toxin ydcE will overwhelm the protection  threshold from antitoxin ydcD. The overexpression of toxin with BMP2 production  is to cause the suicide of B. hurcules and prevent any adverse effect from BMP  overdose.
