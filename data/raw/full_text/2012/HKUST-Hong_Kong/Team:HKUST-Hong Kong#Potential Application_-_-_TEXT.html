POTENTIAL APPLICATION
Regarding the drawbacks of conventional  cancer therapies and the requirements of novel cancer therapy from patients, we  designed our project so as to meet the needs in clinic. With properties of target  binding and controllable anti-tumor molecule synthesis, B. Hercules provides its own potentials in cancer therapy at least  in the following aspects:
Diagnosis:
Screening of colon cancer has been facing great challenges,  as reflected by the low detecting rate. Primarily, the first detection of colon  cancer is either depending on stool tests or endoscopic screening. While the  sensitivity of stool test is relatively low, endoscopic is more sensitive but  complex and expensive. Without effective and simple detecting method, the  mortality rate of colon cancer is unlikely to decrease.
It is obvious that the most ideal way for screening is to  employ a simple, sensitive and inexpensive method to detect the earliest  form of colon cancer. B. Hercules designed in our project can to some extent meet  the criteria.
B. Hercules can  bind to colon tumor and localize it with the help of RPMrel peptide displaying on its cell wall and thus serve as a detector of colon cancer cell, . Even without previous knowledge on the location of colon  tumor, B. Hercules can still execute its function in killing cancer cells as  long as BMP-2 synthesis system is induced after B. Hercules colonizing around  colon tumor. B. Hercules takes use of the simplest therapeutic access, orally taking  medicine, to perform detection. In the meanwhile, it combines the function of a  cancer detector and combatant which can execute cancer treatment as soon as  colon cancer is detected.
Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant  therapy:
Replacing chemotherapy engaging in neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy  is one of the biggest potential applications of our B. Hercules. Neoadjuvant  therapy refers to the treatment given before main therapy which usually used to  facilitate radiotherapy or surgery by shrinking the size of tumor. Adjuvant therapy,  the supplement of main therapy executing after surgery or radiotherapy is  usually engaged to eliminate the chance of relapse of tumor.
Compared with chemotherapies on colon cancer, B. Hercules can largely reduce the adverse effects from wide-spreading anti-tumor drug  through its target-binding property.
In addition, instead of determining the dosage of drug  based on doctor’s experience, having B. Hercules before or after main treatment  can accomplish semi-auto adjustment of drug dosage. When more cancer cells  exist in colon, more B. Hercules will be retained in colon and induced to produce  anti-tumor drug. On the other hand, if cancer cells were no longer present in colon,  the induction effect from xylose will not lead to BMP-2 release. In another  words, the dosage of drug can be controlled even in the absence of an accurate detection of cancer cells in colon.
