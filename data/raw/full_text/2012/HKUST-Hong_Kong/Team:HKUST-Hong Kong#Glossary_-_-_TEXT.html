Signal peptide – transient ‘zip code’ of premature protein which facilitates the secretion of protein in Bacillus subtilis.
YbdN – YbdN stated throughout this wiki refers to the first 24 amino acid residues of the protein YbdN in Bacillus subtilis, which fucntions as a signal peptide.
ybdN – Gene that codes for YbdN.
YdjM – Signal peptide from protein YdjM in Bacillus subtilis.
ydjM – Gene that codes for YdjM.
BMP2 – Bone morphogenetic protein 2.
LytC – B.  subtilis inherent cell-wall associated hydrolase mediating cell-wall turnover.
lytC – Gene that codes for the LytC hydrolase.
(EAAAK)n type helical linker – Stiff, long helical linker designed to separate fusion  proteins with minimal disturbance to the function of both proteins.
RPMrel – A nine amino acid disulfide-constrained peptide with the amino acid sequence n-CPIEDRPMC-c. Product of screening to isolate peptides with positive affinity for HT-29 colon carcinoma cells.
FLAG™ – 8 amino acid peptide tag trademarked by the Sigma-Aldrich Corp. used in attachment to the protein-of-interest to facilitate multiple assays.
PxylA – The region containing the sigma A  binding region for the xylose inducible promoter.
XylR – The transcriptional regulator for  PxylA promoter.
Ptms – A low efficient constitutive promoter  in E. coli and B. subtilis.
EndoA – Endoribonuclease that can inactivate cellular mRNAs by cleaving them at specific but frequently occurring sites (i.e. UAUAAU↓AC).
ydcE (ndoA) – Gene that codes for the EndoA endoribonuclease.
YdcD – Antidote that counteracts the function of EndoA.
ydcD (endB) – Gene that codes for the YdcD antidote.
