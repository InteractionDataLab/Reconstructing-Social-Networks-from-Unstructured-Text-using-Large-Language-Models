repressor switch. </B> The switch is composed of two repressors that repress transcription of each other through binding to the DNA operator upstream of the promoters, similar as in the original bistable toggle switch (Gardner et al., 2000). 
 .</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>Initially we decided to construct <B>the designed switch based on TAL repressors</B> using the same type of topology as the classical toggle switch which was based on bacterial repressors, consisting of <B>two repressors that mutually repress each other</B> (Figure 1). We reasoned that a symmetric state in such a system should be inherently unstable and the system should achieve one of the two stable states when one repressor overpowers the other (either due to stochastic events or due to the exogenous input signal). </P><P>Toggle switches based on prokaryotic binding domains (e.g. TetR and LacI repressors) have been previously used both in bacteria (Gardner et al., 2000) and in mammalian cells, where a moderate dynamic range (the ratio of expression of a reporter protein between its OFF and ON state) was demonstrated (Kramer et al., 2004). The basic switch was further improved by the addition of RNA silencing elements (Greber et al., 2008). </P><TABLE class="inliner" style="width:60%; margin-bottom:40px;"><TBODY class="inliner"><TR class="inliner"><TD class="inliner" style="text-align:justify;"><B>Figure 2. Components of the mutual repressor switch based on TAL repressors. </B> The system consists of sixoperons - two operons that express different TAL repressors from constitutive promoters with TAL binding sites ensure mutual repression (TALA binding sites [A] on the construct expressing TALB repressor and vice versa), two operons that express TAL repressors from inducible promoters, and twooperons that constitutively express inducer-dependent transcription factors.  
 .</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P><B>In our switch we planned to use different TALs as DNA binding domains, with a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain as the repressor domain. Our goal was to enable design and introduction of multiple orthogonal switches into the same cell to perform complex logic operations. </B></P><P>Control over the switch is exerted by activating transcription of identical types of TAL repressors under the control of inducible promoters (Figure 2). Because TAL repressors are expected to have very similar properties, we expected them to be balanced better than two different types of naturally occurring repressors, such as for example the TetR or LacI repressor. The ability to prepare a large number of orthogonal TAL repressors could also support function of many orthogonal switches within a single cell. </P><P><B>Reporters. </B> To enable monitoring the level of expression of each TAL repressor and thereby the state of the switch, we linked the TAL repressor with a unique fluorescent reporter - <B>mCitrine or mNeptune</B> (Figure 2). TAL repressor and fluorescent reporter were connected by an intermediate t2A sequence, causing the ribosome to skip the formation of a peptide bond during protein translation within the t2A sequence, producing the repressor and reporter as separate proteins in equimolar amounts (recently also used by Garg et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2011; de Felipe et al., 2006). We also tested our system using a <B>luciferase reporter. </B></P><P>Inducers. For the external regulation of the epigenetic state of the system we introduced plasmids for transcriptional factors that are regulated by <B>small inducer molecules</B> (pristinamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, rapamycine or ponasterone). We modified the induction systems so that the addition of inducers triggers expression of TAL repressors or activators that can be pluggedin to regulate the TAL-based switch (Figure 3). </P><P>The system should assume one of the two stable states. In state 1 TALA:KRAB is produced, which represses the expression of TALB:KRAB. By the addition of inducer 2, transcription of TALB:KRAB is induced and as TALB:KRAB accumulates, it reduces transcription of TALA:KRAB, relieving in a double negative feedback loop the inhibition of its own expression from the constitutive promoter. When the switch is in the state 2, where TALB:KRAB is expressed and TALA:KRAB is repressed, the external signal can be withdrawn and the switch should remain stable in this state. The state of the switch can be reversed again any time by another pulse of an inductor switching the system tothe opposite state. </P><TABLE class="invisible" style="width:95%; text-align:justify;"><TBODY class="invisible"><TR class="normal"><TD class="invisible"><B>Figure 3. Designed states of the mutual repressor switch. </B> (A) Addition of inducer 1 triggers dissociation of its cognate repressor from its DNA-binding site. Consequently TALA:KRAB is expressed and inhibits state 2, thus causing the switch to switch to state 1. (B) When the inducer is removed, the inducible repressor binds back to its DNA-binding site, but TALA:KRAB is still expressed from the other plasmid and maintains state 1.

This analysis (described in detail in the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Slovenia/Modeling">Modeling section</A>) revealed that <B>the switch would exhibit bistability only in case of high cooperativity of repressors with the non-linearity coefficient larger than approximately 2</B> (Figures 8 and 9), while the system does not exhibit bistability in case of a non-cooperative repressor binding and transcription (nonlinearity coefficient of 1). Since the crystal structure of a TAL effector bound to DNA indicates that the molecule binds as a monomer to the target DNA (Mak et al., 2012), it is safe to assume that <B>binding of TAL repressors to the binding sites upstream of the promoter is independent and non-cooperative. </B> However the cooperativity of the whole process, including not just binding, but also silencing of the heterochromatin, transcription, and translation, is important for the response. The concentration response of the TAL repressors suggested that the system has a low nonlinearity coefficient.
