Quantitative model interactive simulations
Based on experimental data, we constructed a quantitative model. Please see Quantitative and stability model for details of derivation.

Input times [min]
Durations [min]
Erithromycin
Input times [min]
Durations [min]
(For each input time of an inducer, enter its corresponding duration, i.e. after how many minutes the inducer will be removed. )
SIMULATION
Apply measurement noise.
(Measured standard deviations will be applied in the calculations.)
Time:
min
(Simulation running time)
(The results will be shown in a new browser window/tab after few seconds. Have fun.)
