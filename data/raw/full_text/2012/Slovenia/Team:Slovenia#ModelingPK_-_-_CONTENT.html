Additionally, absence of high concentration peaks suggests that our therapy would have less systemic side effects than conventional methods. Since the drug would be constantly produced, drug concentration would not drop enough for the drug to be therapeutically ineffective. According to these findings, steady drug levels over time therefore imply an optimized treatment. With known drug production rate of microencapsulated cells, it is possible to adjust the dosage to reach the desired drug concentration in the target tissue. Therapeutic production was estimated according to activity assays with mammalian cells. After obtaining the results of pharmacokinetic simulation, we were able to calculate the number of microencapsulated cells needed for the therapy.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H2>Introduction</H2><P>The major downsides of standard interferon treatment are substantial side effects that to a large degree are the consequence of very high drug concentrations, occurring shortly after drug administration. If high concentration peaks could be avoided and lower levels maintained steadily over time, this would result in reduced side effects without compromising therapeutic effectiveness. This idea is currently being tested in clinical trials using the interferon infusion pump (<I>COPE-HCV: Phase 2, randomized, open-label, active-control, dose-ranging study of interferon alfa-2b given via continuous sub-Q infusion; trial by Medronic Inc.</I>).</P><P>One of our goals is to show that therapy with drug-producing cells is more beneficial than standard treatments based on drug injections, which are in use today. 
We predict that if the drug is constantly produced inside the body, it could reach a steady concentration at almost any desired level. We believe localization of therapeutic cells would also decrease the proportionate drug concentrations in non-target tissues, thus further reducing the side effects.</P><P>We tested this hypothesis and compared standard therapies with our proposed treatment.
 
Because of complex physiological mechanisms and an extensive set of biological parameters that cannot be accurately measured for either ethical or technical reasons, we developed a model that covers the most crucial aspects and processes. At the same time, computer simulation provides simpler and faster option than <I>in vivo</I> research.</P><H2>3D visualization</H2><P>We implemented a real-time 3D visualization of the pharmacokinetic simulation for hepatitis C and ischemia. This way, we were able to visually represent how drug concentrations change throughout the course of the therapy in various compartments, such as liver. In our 3D visualizations, drug concentration levels are represented as red color intensities - the compartments with high concentrations are closer to saturated red color, while the compartments with low concentrations are closer to white color. Red color intensity of a compartment was calculated as a ratio of the compartment's drug concentration at a given time to the maximal reached concentration of any compartment during the course of the therapy, or therapies compared.</P><P>For implementation, we used C++ programming language and OpenGL for 3D rendering. The 3D anatomical models, obtained from <A href="http://dbarchive.biosciencedbc.jp/en/bodyparts3d/desc.html">BodyParts3D</A> database, were optimized for real-time rendering using <A href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">MeshLab</A> and rendered as vertex arrays in OpenGL. Compartment concentration values as a function of time were obtained as vectors from the pharmacokinetic simulation and integrated into the application.</P><H2>A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model</H2><P>A pharmacokinetic model is a quantitative description of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination from the body. A model is defined by a system of ordinary differential equations to represent essential drug kinetics.

We took into account the necessary biological parameters and based the simulated processes on actual physiological mechanisms to construct a physiologically plausible model.</P><H2>Selecting the optimal physiological model</H2><P>A physiologically based model is composed of multiple compartments which represent organs of the body. Parts were chosen in accordance with drug and tissue specifics, so that the relevant organs are represented as separate compartments, while other tissues were merged on the basis of common characteristics (Levitt et al., 2006).</P><H3>Determing compartments</H3><P>We used the following characteristics as criteria for splitting and merging organs:
<UL style="margin-left:30px;"><LI>Liver is the target organ of therapy.</LI><LI>Interferon alpha is widely distributed into body tissues â highest concentrations occur in kidney, liver and lung.</LI><LI>Interferon is a water-soluble molecule; it is only poorly distributed in adipose tissue.</LI><LI>Interferon alpha does not cross the blood-brain barrier.</LI><LI>Skin and muscle tissues do not seem to have much higher concentrations of the drug in comparison to adipose tissue.</LI><LI>Skin, musle and adipose tissue have similar, slow blood perfusion.</LI><LI>Gut, spleen and heart are all rapidly perfused tissues.</LI><LI>Interferon is mainly eliminated via renal catabolism, while hepatic metabolism accounts only for a minor pathway of elimination. </LI></UL></P><P>We decided to define separate compartments for the liver, kidney and lungs. All other rapidly perfused tissues are grouped together as one part. Since venous blood enters the lungs and arterial blood flows into all other organs, we separately simulate venous and arterial blood. Because interferon does not cross the blood-brain barrier it is not necessary for the brain to be modeled separately. Skin, muscle, fat and other slowly perfused tissues are merged together into one compartment.</P><P>We constructed three final models - two for standard interferon treatments and a third for a prospective therapy with drug-producing microencapsulated cells. The fundamental design is the same in all models; they are only modified for specific entry points of the drug and the corresponding absorption or production processes. On the diagram, blocks representing different administrations are shown in distinct colors: blue for the intravenous bolus, green for the subcutaneous injection and red for the interferon production by microencapsulated cells that are implanted into liver (Figure 1).</P><CENTER><B>Figure 1.</B> Multi-compartment physiologically based pharmacokinetic model, customized for different Interferon therapies. Main difference is the route of administration - for each administration, there is different compartment from which drug enters the body. Blue blocks are used in modeling for intravenous administration, green blocks are specific for subcutaneous administration and red blocks represent continuous production of the drug, in this case in the liver compartment. Therapies of course don't differ only in drug entry points, but also in absorption or production processes, percent of drug that enters the blood stream and so on.</CENTER><H2>Parameters</H2><P>Types of parameters used:</P><H3>1.)

Partition coefficients are an important aspect of pharmacokinetic modeling, because they denote how the drug distributes throughout body tissues. The value of each coefficient has a complex dependence on solubility, permeability, pH, binding affinity of the drug to the receptor receptor and many other factors. The difference in a few amino acids between subtypes of interferon alpha can impact values of coefficients quite noticeably. Even so, there are deviations of evaluated drug distribution of the same subtype of interferon alpha, depending on the detection method (radioactivity, ELISA). </P><P>For legal and ethical reasons these values cannot be directly measured in humans. We had to rely on various studies of interferon tissue distribution in rodents to calculate partition coefficients (Johns et al, 1990).

Time to peak Tmax

The absorption half-life is approximately 2.3 h </P><P>Relying on the available studies, we specified the absorption as a two phase process:</P><P>1.) At the beginning, when the drug concentration at the injection site is highest, only a limited amount of drug can be absorbed into the blood - the rate of absorption is maximal.

However, these values do differ from study to study (e.g. that kidney concentration is 1-9x times that of plasma (Bohoslawec et al., 1986), but they overall agree that after  subcutaneous or intravenous administration, interferon concentration is highest in the kidney, very high in the liver and lungs and to some extent in other rapidly perfused tissues, but lower in the adipose and other slowly perfused tissues.</P><TABLE class="normal" style="font-size:90%; width:60%; text-align:center;"><TBODY class="normal"><THEAD class="normal"><TR><TD class="normal">Compartment</TD><TD class="normal">Parameter name</TD><TD class="normal">Value</TD></TR></THEAD><TR class="normal"><TD class="normal">lung</TD><TD class="normal">P<SUB>blood:lung</SUB></TD><TD class="normal">2.5</TD></TR><TR class="normal"><TD class="normal">liver</TD><TD class="normal">P<SUB>blood:liver</SUB></TD><TD class="normal">2.8</TD></TR><TR class="normal"><TD class="normal">kidney</TD><TD class="normal">P<SUB>blood:kidney</SUB></TD><TD class="normal">8.5</TD></TR><TR class="normal"><TD class="normal">rapidly perfused tissue</TD><TD class="normal">P<SUB>blood:rpt</SUB></TD><TD class="normal">2.2</TD></TR><TR class="normal"><TD class="normal">slowly perfused tissue</TD><TD class="normal">P<SUB>blood:spt</SUB></TD><TD class="normal">0.7</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H3>3.)

In this case, cell production of a drug is mathematically equivalent to a continuous infusion of a drug into the tissue, where cells are located.
To calculate the desired concentration level in the target tissue, we calculated AUC (area under the curve) of liver concentrations for subcutaneous administration over a period of one week. This allowed us to estimate the average concentration in the liver which corresponds to the therapeutic level we wish to reach and maintain with cellular drug production. The combination of kidney elimination and constant production leads to stable drug levels in tissues. After about four half-lives, drug concentrations rise to final levels and remain steady as long as the production rate stays the same (Figure 3).  </P><CENTER><B>Figure 3.</B> Drug distribution troughout tissues with Switch-IT therapy.</CENTER><H2>Results and conclusions</H2><P>If we compare result of different treatments it clearly shows that local therapy with drug producing cells does not result in concentration fluctuations, which are present in common therapies.

Concentrations never reach levels as high as in subcutaneous or intravenous administration. On the other hand, concentrations do not drop to a point, which would prevent the drug from becoming therapeutically inefficient.</P><P>When the drug is produced at the target site, concentration levels between target tissues and other organs are inclined in favor of the target tissue - although kidneys show a substantial uptake of the drug in subcutaneous administration, the relative difference between kidney and liver concentrations are smaller with localized therapy (Figure 4).</P><CENTER><B>Figure 4.</B> Comparison of subcutaneous and Switch-IT therapy. We can see the new therapy results in stable concentration levels, without peaks and lows.</CENTER><H2>From model to implementation</H2><P>When we calculate the desired steady concentration in the target tissue, it was possible to estimate how many cells  would need to be implanted. From the required production rate, which is thought to be linearly proportional to the cell count, we can calculate the total number of cells needed. Considering the average number of cells per microcapsule and mean capsule size, we can calculate the amount of microcapsules we would need to inject in order to attain the wanted therapeutic effect. </P><H2>Anakinra therapy modeling</H2><P>For modeling the local application of anakinra-producing microencapsulated cells in the ischaemic muscle tissue we adopted slightly different approach. Liver is perfused by sinusoid capillaries which allow for passage of macromolecules to the tissue, therefore even protein therapeutics can be rapidly equilibrated with blood and distributed around the organism. Muscle tissue, however, is perfused with continuous capillaries, which prevents fast passage of macromolecules from the tissue to the blood (Figure 5). Protein molecules pass the continuous capillaries only through slow trans-pinocytosis. Consequently this increases the local concentration of therapeutics permitting the achievement of high local concentration with relatively little loss to the system and elimination by kidneys.</P><CENTER><B>Figure 5. </B>Different capillary types in muscle tissue (continuous capillary, left) and in liver (sinusoid capillary, right). Image from: (Mescher, 2009)</CENTER><P>Therefore we took this feature of the tissue into account when calculating partition coefficients between tissue and blood compartment. Myoglobin has similar molecular weight as anakinra; therefore we assumed its partition coefficient to be the same(Hall, 2010). We calculated the therapeutic concentration of anakinra to be 25 ng/mL, which we derived from the anakinra IC_50 value (DahlÃ©n et al., 2008).</P><H3>Compartmental model and simulation parameters</H3><P>According to a study of anakinra distribution and elimination after subcutaneous injection, we calculated relevant compartments for physiological model. At first, we modeled standard regime for anakinra therapy: 100 mg per day subcutaneously with the following parameters:<UL style="margin-left:30px;"><LI>bioavailability: F = 95%</LI><LI>half life: T<SUB>1/2</SUB> = 5h</LI><LI>time to maximum concentration: T<SUB>max</SUB> = 4h</LI><LI>maximum concentration: C<SUB>max</SUB> = 780 ng/mL</LI><LI>average concentration: C<SUB>avg</SUB> = 350 ng/mL</LI></UL></P><CENTER><B>Figure 6.</B> Multi-compartment model for anakinra. For local therapy model, we added one additional compartment (shown in purple color) inside the heart compartment. This represents the affected area, where microencapsulated cells would be administered to. In conventional therapy model, the whole heart, both infarcted and undamaged tissue, are represented as one, since standard treatments can not target selected area specifically. </CENTER><P>We calculated following partition coefficients according to a study on drug distribution in rodents (Kim et al., 1995).</P><TABLE class="normal" style="width:60%;"><THEAD class="normal"><TR class="normal"><TH class="normal">tissue</TH><TH class="normal">percent of dose</TH></TR></THEAD><TBODY class="normal"><TR class="normal"><TD class="normal">kidney</TD><TD class="normal">11 %</TD></TR><TR class="normal"><TD class="normal">liver</TD><TD class="normal">9 %</TD></TR><TR class="normal"><TD class="normal">gut</TD><TD class="normal">6 %</TD></TR><TR class="normal"><TD class="normal">lung</TD><TD class="normal">2 %</TD></TR><TR class="normal"><TD class="normal">muscle</TD><TD class="normal">43 %</TD></TR><TR class="normal"><TD class="normal">plasma</TD><TD class="normal">26 %</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><CENTER><B>Figure 7.</B> Dose distribution plot, fitted to the literature data, which was used to determine the partition coefficients for the listed tissues.</CENTER><P>Partition coefficients of tissues are proportionate to drug concentrations (for non-eliminating tissue). From drug amount in each tissue and tissue volumes, we could find calculate concentration ratios and then estimate coefficient values. Parameters are further tuned to fit measured data as much as possible.
