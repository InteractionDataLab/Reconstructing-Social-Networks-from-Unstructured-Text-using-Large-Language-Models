microcapsules</H3><P>Our biopharmaceutical delivery system is based on microencapsulated mammalian cells which produce the required therapeutics. These cells are safely sealed in the alginate microcapsules, forming an immune-privileged environment for the therapeutic cells, and implanted into the tissue such as e.g. the eye or placenta. The semi-permeable capsule allows free transport of nutrients, signaling molecules and produced protein therapeutics, while it prevents immune cells from reaching and destroying the implanted therapeutic cells. Therapeutic cells do not need to be immuno-compatible for each individual patient and can therefore be optimized and mass produced to increase their efficiency and affordability of this therapy. </P><P><B>We designed our device to leave no trace after the therapy has been completed, </B> by initiating secretion of an alginate-degrading enzyme to break down the microcapsules followed by the <A href="https://2012.igem.org/Team:Slovenia/SafetyMechanismsTermination">apoptosis of therapeutic cells</A>. This approach should increase the safety and decrease the unwanted effects of treatment and also makes the surgical removal of microcapsules or fibrotic tissue around microcapsules obsolete. </P><TABLE class="invisible" style="width:90%; text-align:justify;"><TBODY class="invisible"><TR class="normal"><TD class="invisible"><B>Figure 1.

</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><H3>Alginate microcapsules</H3><P>Alginate is the most widely used and clinically tested biomaterial for cell encapsulation. It is found in cell walls of brown seaweed. This polysaccharide is made of (1, 4)-linked monomeric units of Î²-D-mannuronate (M) and Î±-L-guluronate (G) (Figure 2). Consecutive M or G residues form so called M- or G-blocks, whereas the alternating M and G units constitute MG-blocks of alginate (Duan et al., 2009). </P><P><TABLE class="invisible" style="width:50%; float:left; margin-bottom:20px;"><TBODY class="invisible"><TR class="normal"><TD class="invisible"><B>Figure 2.

Alginate microcapsules are an almost ideal solution for this problem: the encapsulated cells are protected against the cytotoxic cells while the material used is biocompatible and allows exchange of small molecules and proteins (Figure 1). It has been demonstrated that encapsulated cells remain viable for several months; therefore many therapeutic programs can be accomplished within this time frame. This sequestration technology also prevents the uncontrolled dissemination of our device throughout the patient's body (AuslÃ¤nder et al., 2011). </P><P>Cell encapsulation is technically achieved by dropping a mixture of cells and liquid alginate into a calcium chloride solution which solidifies the droplets, transforming them into the hydrogel beads whose size in our system can be adjusted within the range of 300-500 Î¼m in diameter. These beads are then coated with a polycation such as poly(L-lysine) (PLL) to form a membrane which further decreases the porosity of the wall of capsules. In the next step of cell encapsulation, an outer alginate layer is applied. This alginate coat also minimizes the attachment of patient's cells to the microcapsules due to the net negative charge of its surface (Vos et al., 2006). To allow cell growth and division within the alginate beads, the core of microcapsules is depolymerized with sodium citrate. </P><H3>Encapsulation and degradation of microcapsules</H3><P>Hopefully, after a few weeks or months of treatment, the patient would recover and we could terminate the genetically engineered microencapsulated cells by inducing apoptosis. However, before their programmed death, production and secretion of the alginate-degrading enzyme would be induced. Alginate lyase can break down the alginate polymer of microcapsules, ideally leaving no trace of our biopharmaceutical delivery system.</P><P>Alginate lyases are not present in the mammalian genome but have been found in bacteria, algae and marine mollusks. Alginate lyase is able to depolymerize the alginate crosslinked by calcium (Breguet et al., 2007). Alginate lyases degrade alginate by the reaction of Î²-elimination and are classified based on their substrates: some prefer M-rich alginate, whereas others prefer G-rich. Therefore we selected an enzyme that could degrade both, G- and M-blocks of alginate. We found from the literature the alginate lyase from bacterium <I>Pseudoalteromonas elyakovii</I> to be a promising candidate, since it can degrade all types of alginate (Sawabe et al., 2007). Since we could not obtain the gene for the described enzyme from the authors we decided to design a synthetic mammalian codon usage-optimized and BioBrick standard-compatible version of this bacterial gene for our iGEM project (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K782059">BBa_K782059</A>). Furthermore, because the selected alginate lyase consists of two domains, a putative chitin binding like-domain which is posttranslationally cleaved off in a bacterial expression system and an alginate lyase domain representing the mature enzyme (Sawabe et al., 2007) (Figure 4), we also prepared a truncated version of <I>P. elyakovii</I> alginate lyase, abbreviated by chitin binding like-domain (<A href="http://partsregistry.org/wiki/index.php?title=Part:BBa_K782062">BBa_K782062</A>). We replaced the original bacterial signal peptide with the preprotrypsin leader sequence to ensure the efficient secretion from mammalian cells and attached a Myc tag at the C-terminus to facilitate the detection of the secreted enzyme (Figure 5). The second implemented alginate lyase was from <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </I> strain PAO1 (bacteria were kindly provided by dr. Guillermo Martinez de Tejada from Univ. Navarra, Spain). These Gram-negative bacteria secrete alginate lyase to degrade the alginate that forms the mucoid matrix composing the bacterial biofilm (Schiller et al., 1993). This alginate lyase might therefore also be used for medical applications to degrade the viscous polysaccharide coat of <I>Pseudomonas</I> in patients with cystic fibrosis. </P><P><TABLE class="invisible" style="width:50%; float:left; text-align:justify;"><TBODY class="invisible"><TR class="normal"><TD class="invisible"><B>Figure 4. <I>Pseudomoalteromonas elyakovii</I> alginate lyase structure model prepared by I-TASSER server</B> (Roy et al., 2011).

The enzyme was engineered for secretion from HEK293T cells by the addition of preprotrypsin sequence to the N-terminus. Additionally, protein without chitin binding like-domain was also prepared (mature alginate lyase).

Aliquots of encapsulated cells were collected at regular intervals, stained with cell viability dyes and observed with confocal microscopy (Figure 6). Results show that cells readily divide and fill up the hollow space inside the alginate microcapsule within three weeks (504 h). Furthermore, we have shown that encapsulated HEK293T cells remain viable for over a month (672 h) and show no signs of extensive necrosis. As a future alternative we could encapsulate a fixed number of cells that are deficient in cell division which has been previously demonstrated to enhance production of therapeutic proteins (Fussenegger et al., 1998). </P><TABLE class="invisible" style="width:90%; text-align:justify;"><TBODY class="invisible"><TR class="normal"><TD class="invisible"><B>Figure 6.

Western blots of supernatants and lysates were obtained and alginate lyase was detected with anti-Myc antibodies.

Neither <I>P. elyakovii</I> alginate lyase produced by cells nor alginate lyase from <I>Sphingobacterium multivorum</I> were able to degrade alginate-PLL-alginate capsules. Next, we immobilized HEK293T cells in alginate beads without a PLL membrane and without desolidification of the bead's core. We observed a rapid rupture of alginate beads and their degradation by the addition of alginate lyase (Figure 8). Concentrations of alginate lyase as low as 5 Âµg/mL were shown to disintegrate produced alginate beads. In order to demonstrate that this degradation was due to the enzymatic activity of the alginate lyase and not caused by any other component that might sequester calcium, we heat denatured the enzyme, which abolished degradation of beads, demonstrating that the enzyme is indeed responsible for the capsule degradation and that this technology could be used for the therapeutic beads degradation.</P><TABLE class="invisible" style="width:70%; text-align:justify;"><TBODY class="invisible"><TR class="normal"><TD class="invisible"><B>Figure 8.

As determined by Western blot analysis (Figure 7), HEK293T cells secreted low amounts of alginate lyase; therefore we concentrated the cell supernatants and incubated them with alginate beads. The enzymatic activity was demonstrated by a decrease of the diameter of alginate beads determined by microscopy.
