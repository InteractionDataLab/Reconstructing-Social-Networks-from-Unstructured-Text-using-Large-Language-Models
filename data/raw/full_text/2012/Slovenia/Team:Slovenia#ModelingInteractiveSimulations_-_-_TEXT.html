Experimental model interactive simulations
Based on experimental data, we constructed an experimental model. Please see Experimental model for details of derivation. For old models (developed before European Regional Jamboree), click here.

Durations [min]
(For each input time of an inducer, enter its corresponding duration, i.e. after how many minutes the inducer will be removed. )
SIMULATION
Apply measurement noise.
(Measured standard deviations will be applied in the calculations.)
