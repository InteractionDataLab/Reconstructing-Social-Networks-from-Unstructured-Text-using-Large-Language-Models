Competent Cell Testing
Results:
The transformation efficiency for all of the Top10 cells were 1 x 10^7 CFU/µg while the transofmration efficiency for the Fusion Blue and BL21 cells were 1 x 10^6 CFU/µg.
Recommendation:
New competent cells need to be made from the Top10 as we need at least a transformation efficiency of 1 x 10^8 CFU/µg.
