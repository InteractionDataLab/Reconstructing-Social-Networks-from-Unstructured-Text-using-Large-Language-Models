Gibson Assembly Protocol
Before entering the lab, the assigned Gibson Assembly team for the day organised agar plate requirements, concentration calculations and equipment requirements. All gBlocks had arrived and thus Gibson Assembly was performed on all fragments.
Each tube was labelled with antibiotic (C = Chloramphenicol, K = Kanamycin, A = Ampicillin) resistance contained within the allocated plasmid. Tubes labeled 1 & 2 represent Heme Oxygenase fragment mixtures, tubes labeled 3 represent Deinococcus fragment mixtures & tubes labeled 4 & 5 represent Agrobacterium fragment mixtures. Take note that #1C and #4C contain T7 promoter fragments whereas the other BioBricks are T7 'promoter-less'. Deinococcus BioBrick does not contain any T7 promoters as described here.
Each Gene Block fragment was supplied as 200ng and before use it was dissolved in 20µl of TE buffer. The table below shows each tube with vector & volume, volume of Gibson Master Mix, water volume & volume of each gBlock fragment. After incubation, these were transformed into Top10 cells using the Transformation Protocol found here - Transformation Protocol .
