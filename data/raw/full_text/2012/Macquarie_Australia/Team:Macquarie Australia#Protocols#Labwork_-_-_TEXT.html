Further work for the Fluorescent Bacteria for Open Day
150 ul (0.1 millimolar) of IPTG was added to each LB (ampicillin) plate and left for 40 minutes to dry. From the red & green fluorescent bacteria that grew, we inoculated SOC broth with a loopful of each transformant - i.e. green or red fluorescent. Using this inoculated broth, we drew various pictures with a sterilized loop onto LB (ampicillin) plates which resulted in 12 plates for incubation. These plates are incubated overnight at 37C.
