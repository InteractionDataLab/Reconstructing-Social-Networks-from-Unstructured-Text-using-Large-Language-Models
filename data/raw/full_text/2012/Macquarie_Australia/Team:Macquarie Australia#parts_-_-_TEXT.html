Parts Submitted
Our Team has successfully characterised the following three parts and have submitted them to the registry:
Part BBa_K953000
Heme Oxygenase with T7 & RBS (E. coli Codon Optimised). This composite part comprises of Heme Oxygenase with RBS from part BBa_K953004 and a T7 Promoter from part BBa_I712074 , which was designed by  iGEM07 Ljubljana. This part has been codon optimised for use in E. coli whilst still conforming to GC content limitations to allow for successful synthesis.
Part BBa_K953001
Deinococcus radiodurans Bacteriophytochrome with RBS (E. coli Codon Optimised). This part contains bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans and also includes a RBS. This part was also codon optimised for use in E. coli whilst still conforming to GC content limitations to allow for successful synthesis.
Part BBa_K953002
Agrobacterium tumefaciens Bacteriophytochrome with RBS (E. coli Codon Optimised). This part contains bacteriophytochrome from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and also includes a RBS. This part was also codon optimised for use in E. coli whilst still conforming to GC content limitations to allow for successful synthesis.
Parts Developed
In addition to the above parts which were submitted to the registry, we have also developed other parts that have not been submitted. This includes various combinations of Heme Oxygenase and Bacteriophytochrome to develop the self assembling switch.  Details of all our developed parts can be found below.
