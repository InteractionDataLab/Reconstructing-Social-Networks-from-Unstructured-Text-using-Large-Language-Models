The Macquarie Australia team for iGEM 2012 are a group of undergraduate students working on this project as a component of our studies at Macquarie University. We come from a range of backgrounds, including medical science, biology, chemistry and biomolecular science. Our project aims to develop a light-controlled switch that can be incorporated into cells in order to induce or inhibit the expression of targeted genes. This will allow a mechanism to control gene expression without applying heat, radiation or foreign chemicals to the cell, providing a valuable tool with applications in current industries and future research.
