Macquarie University is actively seeking sponsorship- sponsor the only Australian team going for gold!
Each team must clearly attribute work done by the team on this page.  They must distinguish work done by the team from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, graduate students, and postgraduate masters students.
