Outreach: Presentations for Open Day 8th September 2012
Progress so far on preparing for the Macquarie University Open Day on the 8th of September 2012
A team have been creating posters to hang in the science labs to complement activities and presentations, organising activities for visitors (pipetting demonstrations and hands on activities, looking through microscopes, looking at plates with fluorescent bacteria) and planning conceptual activities for visitors to work through.
The activities will introduce Synthetic Biology to the public. Discussion points the team have come up with include: "If there was a super power you could have, what would it be?" From this question, the visitors will have to come up with what super powers they would combine (i.e. What genes would you combine?) and thus is an easy way to think about our constructs we are working with. Lego is also another idea the team have come up with to show concepts behind synthetic biology. These activities have three target audiences:
Future students of Macquarie University
Parents of future students
Younger siblings
