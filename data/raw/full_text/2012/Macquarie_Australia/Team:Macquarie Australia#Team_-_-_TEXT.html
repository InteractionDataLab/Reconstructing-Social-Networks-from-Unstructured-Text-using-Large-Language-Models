Team Macquarie
The 2012 Macquarie University iGEM team is comprised third year science students from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds, including biomolecular science and chemistry. The team are currently completing a unit of study which incorporates iGEM as part of their coursework, with each team member bringing previous experience and knowledge from their degree to help make this project possible.
Elle Worgan
Bachelor of Science - Biomolecular Science and Education
Elle took control of organising and planning our open day activities. She will be representing the team at the regional jamboree in Hong Kong.
Harry Spedding
Bachelor of Science - Biomolecular Science
Harry poured over our sequencing data ensuring that we produced what we expected. He had roles in many of the projects we were doing including Gibson assembly and different digestions and ligations. Harry will be representing the team at the regional jamboree in Hong Kong.
Sarah Grixti
Bachelor of Science - Biomolecular Science
Sarah prepared media for the teams media, especially the antibiotic plates. Sarah played a key role in acquiring finances to get the team to attend the regional jamboree.
Laura Jeffery
Bachelor of Science - Biology and Biomolecular Science
Laura helped to develop the open day outreach plan. Laura had key roles in transforming cells for the open day with fluorescent parts.
Daniel Winter
Bachelor of Science - Biology and Biomolecular Science
Daniel was our plasmid preparation king. Without Daniel, none of our sequencing would have been performed. He also helped out with transformations and helped to develop buffers and media. Daniel was also a member of the school visit team, he will also be representing the team in Hong Kong.
Silas Vick
Bachelor of Advanced Science - Biology and Biomolecular Science
Silas helped to develop our gBlocks, as well as participated in the assembly. He contributed to many of the lab sessions, performing transformations and casting gels. He will also be representing the team in Hong Kong.
Gazelle Pashan
Bachelor of Science - Biomolecular Science
Gazelle helped the open day team prepare the powerpoint presentations. She also helped out with finding sponsorship.
Andrew Diehm
Bachelor of Science - Chemistry and Biomolecular Science
Andrew helped in the preparation of all of our buffers and media. He also helped Daniel in plasmid preps.
Jack Brandy
Bachelor of Science - Microbiology and Biomolecular Science
Jack formed a great partnership with Andrew and helped to coordinate the lab team in the early weeks. He was instrumental in getting the media and buffers prepared as well as transforming the cells for our open day presentations.
Rob McGraw
Bachelor of Science - Biology and Biomolecular Science
Rob was instrumental in our lab work, coordinating the team to ensure that our deadlines were met. Rob was involved in growing cultures and troubleshooting procedures. He had a big hand in preparing competent cells. Rob is representing the team in Hong Kong.
Ellaina Andersson
Bachelor of Medical Science - Biology and Biomolecular Science
Ellaina was our technical guru, her understanding of the project helped us to develop our plan and timeline. She planned and put into action the school visit as part of our human outreach. Ellaina has contributed in the lab performing countless transformations. She will also be representing the team in Hong Kong.
Kimberly Duncan
Bachelor of Science - Biology and Genetics
Kim helped Harry in checking all of our sequence data. She also performed Gibson assemblies and participated in the open day presentations. Kim is representing the team in Hong Kong.
Erin Hoyer
Bachelor of Science - Biomolecular Science
Erin was our resident photographer and helped organise the wiki. She helped to develop the open day plan and the different posters we were using.
Miguel Sanjurjo
Bachelor of Genetics
Miguel participated in the open day presentations as well as helped to develop the gBlocks.
Matt Smith
Bachelor of Science - Biomolecular Science
Matt helped with the school visit and prepared some of the slides. He was involved in developing the gBlocks.
Matt "Giggles" StClair
Bachelor of Science - Biomolecular Science and Genomics
Matt was the go to man for developing the gBlocks, spending countless hours developing the blocks for synthesis. Matt spent many hours innoculating cultures and was also a key member of the Gibson assembly attempts. Matt is also attending the regional jamboree.
Ryan Kenny
Bachelor of Advanced Science - Organic Chemistry and Biomolecular Science
Ryan was the wiki chief, spending hours putting together the framework for the site. He contributed to the school visit and open day presentation. Ryan also had a role in developing the gBlocks and participated in the Gibson assembly. Ryan is representing the team in Hong Kong.
