1. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, Beta Subunit (hCG-β) - BBa_K732000
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced during pregnancy. Its beta subunit (hCG-β) contains epitopes recognized by pregnancy tests. The full hCG dimer is also used as an ovulation inducer and can stimulate the production of testosterone in men. This sequence can be used to express hCG for any downstream uses, and also as an output signal since it can trigger pregnancy tests at low concentrations.
2. Synthetic Chorionic Gonadotropin, beta (synCG-β) - BBa_K732001
A synthetic version of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) codon-optimized for bacterial expression and sequence composability. For ease of synthesis, synonymous codons of slightly lower usage bias were used in some cases to reduce GC content and avoid hairpin structures.
3. synCG-β + Promoter + RBS - BBa_K732002
This construct contains a strong constitutive promoter (J23119) as well as an RBS (B0034) upstream of synCG-β (K732001) to strongly express a synthetic version of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin.
4. bbp9 - BBa_K732003
Putative lysin from the Bordetella phage genome. Contains sequence similarity to ElmA, a protein in E. coli that breaks down capsid polysaccharides.
