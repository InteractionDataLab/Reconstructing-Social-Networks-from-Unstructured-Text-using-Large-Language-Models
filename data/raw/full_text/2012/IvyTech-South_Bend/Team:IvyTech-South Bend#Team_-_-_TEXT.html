Team Ivy Tech
.
We are undergraduate students in the Biotech and Nanotech at Ivy Tech Community College.  We have had the invaluable experience of working as undergrads on real world problems in a lab setting that many in our positions don’t get.  We value the guidance and instruction given by Professor Twaddle and the experience gained by completing our first genetic engineering competition.
