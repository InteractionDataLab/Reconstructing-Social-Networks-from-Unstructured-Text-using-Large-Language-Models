On Saturday, September 15th, we hosted the first ever New England Regional iGEM (NEGEM) meeting at Boston University. We hosted a total of four iGEM teams for the afternoon and each team gave a practice presentation in preparation for the Regional Jamboree in Pittsburgh. Teams from MIT, Wellesley, and Brown-Stanford joined us for an afternoon of presentation feedback and fun!
As a part of the NEGEM meeting, audience members filled in anonymous feedback forms for each presentation. The questions focused on the content of the presentation, including questions on the project's motivation, results, and figures. The forms for each team were collected and returned to the teams so they could use this feedback to improve their presentations in time for the Jamboree.
We'd like to thank everyone who came out and joined us for NEGEM! It was a lot of fun to see everyone and to see the results of all of your hard work this summer. You helped make this meeting a success and we hope to host NEGEM again next summer!
