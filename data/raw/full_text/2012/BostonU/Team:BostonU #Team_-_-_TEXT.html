Traci Haddock | Boston University
Traci is a postdoctoral research associate in the Densmore laboratory at Boston University. She has been the primary mentor to the wet lab team members this summer and became very accustomed to hearing "Traci, I have a question...". Her nerdy hobby is collecting X-Men comic books and her favorite band is U2.
