Safety
1. Would any of your project ideas raise  safety issues in terms of:
researcher safety,
Personnel safety is one of the top priorities of the BL1 lab.  Before starting lab work, we attended lab safety training provided by the  Institutional Biosafety Committee. We were familiarized with the operation of  lab equipment and nature of chemicals we use after being trained by our  mentors..While we are working at the lab, we take every necessary precaution to  prevent any type of injuries through wearing long pants and sleeves, wearing  gloves and close toed shoes. In addition, we prohibit food or drinks to be  brought into the lab to prevent ingestion of contaminated foods. We also follow  all the laboratory guidelines and practices to ensure a safe and sound working  environment. In terms of materials we come in contact with, the only components  of our lab that may be harmful are the UV lights and SYBER. To prevent UV light  damage, we wear plastic face masks. To prevent SYBER contamination, we wear  gloves.
public safety, or
The safety of the public is very important to us. Although we do  not work with pathogenic organisms, we still take containment seriously. We do  not allow the public into our lab to prevent any sort of contact between E.  coli and reagents with the public. In addition, our lab has recently been  examined and has passed inspections by biosafety specialists of the Institution  of Biosafety Committee.
environmental safety?
We care for the safety of the environment that we are part of.  Thus, we take safety precautions to make the environment as productive and  functional as possible. We dispose our waste appropriately into the designated  containers whether they are bioharzardous or sharps or glass. We maintain a  strong doctrine on preventing environmentally hazardous material from entering  the public water system through drainage from sinks. We therefore have waste  collection containers for different types of waste materials located all over  the lab to encourage safe and easy disposal habits.
2. Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or  devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues? If yes,
did you document these issues in the Registry?
how did you manage to handle the safety issue?
How could other teams learn from your  experience?
Our project this year is based in the MoClo technique for  creating new parts. This approach decreases the likelihood of safety issues  occurring since the technique combines multiple steps of DNA manipulation. As  the number of steps required to achieve to reach our goal decreases, the  chances for safety issues to happen also decrease. Moreover, the parts we are  making are safe for they do not contain genetic coding for toxins or other  lethal organic molecules. However, in the hypothetical case that if one of our  parts were to raise safety issues, we would document the issues in the  registry, and also include ways to handle the issue.
3. Is there a local biosafety group,  committee, or review board at your institution?
If yes, what does your local biosafety group think about  your project?
There is a Institution of Biosafety Committee on campus at Boston  University. They have provided us with standardized safety training in addition  to biannual lab safety examinations. We also have a liaison of lab safety in  the lab to also enforce IBC’s policies and lab safety guidelines. The IBC is  fully aware of our project, and that it is in compliance with IBC’s biosafety  guidelines.
4. Do you have any other ideas how to deal  with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions? How could  parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering?
This year we are focusing on a standard method for characterizing  parts in order to systematically produce data that enables more efficient  design of genetic circuits. We think that part safety is an essential aspect to  be considered when a part is described. Therefore, for future iGEM  competitions, when characterizing a part there should be a section for part  safety information that would include possible safety issues and protocols that  ensure safe manipulation of the part.
