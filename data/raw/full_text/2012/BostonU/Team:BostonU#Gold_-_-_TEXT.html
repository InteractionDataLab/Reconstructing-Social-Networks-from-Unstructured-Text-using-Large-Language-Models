Give Us Gold
Our team was awarded a Gold Medal at the Americas East Regional Jamboree! Only 40% of the teams at the Regional were awarded Gold medals.
✓ Improve the function of an existing BioBrick Part or Device and enter this information in the Registry, and don't forget to create a new registry page for the improved part. By converting a set of commonly used BioBrick parts into MoClo parts , we've improved the ease-of-use of these parts.
✓ Help another iGEM team by characterizing a part, debugging a construct, or modeling or simulating their system. This year, we worked with Wellesley .
✓ Outline and detail a new approach to an issue of Human Practice in synthetic biology as it relates to your project, such as safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
✓ Demonstrate that at least one new BioBrick Part or Device of your own design and construction works as expected; characterize the operation of your new part/device. We built and tested an inverter using BioBricks ( BBa_K783067 ). We've also built numerous simple BioBrick composite parts and tested them (BBa_K783068-K780381). Our new BioBrick Part is BBa_K783066 , which is a new repressible promoter called pMmoR . We're in the process of testing that for the Jamboree.
✓ Enter this information and other documentation on the part's 'Main Page' section of the Registry. Our new BioBrick Part is BBa_K783066 , which is a new repressible promoter called pMmoR . Our inverter is BBa_K783067 , and our simple parts are BBa_K783068-K780381.
✓ Team Registration
✓ Complete the Judging Form
✓ Team Wiki
✓ Present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree
✓ Enter information detailing at least one new standard BioBrick Part or Device in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Including: Primary nucleaic acid sequence, Description of function, Authorship, Safety notes, if relevant, and Acknowledgment of sources and references. Our new BioBrick Part is BBa_K783066 , which is a new repressible promoter called pMmoR . We have also made a MoClo version of pMmoR ( BBa_K783082 ) and the mmoR gene ( BBa_K78083 ). We're in the process of making the mmoR gene in BioBricks and will show our data at the Jamboree.
