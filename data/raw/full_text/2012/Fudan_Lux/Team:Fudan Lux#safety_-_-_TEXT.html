Safety What we are concerned.
1.Would any of your project ideas raise safety issues ？
We only used Ecoli and tumor cells for our project.And we won't spread any things to environment in our project.
2.Do any of the new BioBrick parts (or devices) that you made this year raise any safety issues?
The biobricks we used had been widely used in iGEM.The biobrick we made is a combination of LOV domain and HTH-motif which are Non-toxic。
3.Is there a local biosafety group, committee, or review board at your institution?
Such group in our life-science college thought what we made was safe to both human and environment.
4.Do you have any other ideas how to deal with safety issues that could be useful for future iGEM competitions?
How could parts, devices and systems be made even safer through biosafety engineering? I think we could add dangerous-sequence-monitoring features to partsregistry.org.
