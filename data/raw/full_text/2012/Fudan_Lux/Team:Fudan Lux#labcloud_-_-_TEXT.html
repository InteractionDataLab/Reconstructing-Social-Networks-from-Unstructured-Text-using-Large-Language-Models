LabCloud

With Labcloud,iGEMers can communicate in mobile way!
Cloud Notes provides an effcient way of sharing ideas and experiment logs. It has a html-based editor(Thanks to TQEditor Project) which enables rich-text editor. You can select font size, font color, alignment, or even insert a horizon line. You can also add pictures, attachments, URLs, dates, records and positions with the "Add button". Each group can have multiple notebooks to write on.
Cloud Reminders
