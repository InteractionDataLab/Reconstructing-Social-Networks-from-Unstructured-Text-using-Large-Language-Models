Project LabCloud aims to provide a mobile app for iGEMers to share their experiments, logs, ideas, files and others in and between teams. It will also provide group’s shared calendar, instruments management and other powerful functions to help iGEMers’ cooperation. Moreover, it has the Push Notification feather to ensure timely communication. Besides, we create an APP Biobrick Viewer accompany with labcloud to provide an easy access to partsregistry.You will find it on App Store soon and it is free for iGEMers!)
