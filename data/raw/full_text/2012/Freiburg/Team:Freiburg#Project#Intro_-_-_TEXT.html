October 2009
Two research groups publish the TAL Effector codes in the same issue of Science: Amino acid 12 and 13 of every DNA binding module specifically binds to one nucleotide
October 2010
Voytas Lab develops TALENs. These fusion proteins of FokI and a TAL protein cut as dimers and allow researchers to cut virtually anywhere in the genome. Since double strand breaks increase efficiency of homologous recombination, TALENS are a powerful tool for genetic engineering and gene therapy
February 2011
Based on an exclusive licensing agreement with the University of Minnasota, Cellectis bioresearch launches its TAL effector product line. One TALEN pair currently costs 5000 Euro (6454 US$, 26.10.12).
October 2011
The iGEM team from Harvard University employed fancy and expensive techniques to find up to 15 new zinc fingers (each of which binds to 3 bp). There has to be a better way…
December 2011
Nature chooses TALENs as the 2011 Method of the year.
February 2012
The first two crystal structures of TALE modules bound to DNA published in the same issue of Science. The protein literally wraps itself around the DNA double helix and forms these beautiful symmetric shapes.
April 2012
Joung lab publishes FLASH assembly in Nature Biotechnology. This first automatable TAL assembly platform facilitates assembly of 96 TAL DNA fragments in less than a day using a pipeting robot.
October 2012
The Freiburg iGEM team makes TALE technology available to everyone by introducing the GATE assembly kit. For TALEs targeting 14 bp, this platform is currently the fastest, cheapest and easiest method in the world.
Originally, TAL proteins are virulence factors of the plant-pathogenic ''Xanthomonas  spp.'' that are injected into plant cells via a type III secretion system in order to modulate transcription1. For this purpose, their c-terminal end contains a nuclear localisation signal (NLS) and an acidic activation domain. The central part of the TAL protein contains a number of almost similar repeats that mediate specific binding to target loci in the genome. In 2009, two groups have simultaneously pointed out that each of these repeats specifically binds to one base of the target DNA via two amino acids (aa 12 and 13), named the repeat variable diresidues (RVD)2 (see figure 1). Moreover, it has been shown that DNA binding of these proteins is highly modular, i.e. the number of bases or sequence of the target DNA can be altered by adjusting the number or order of the repeats in the TAL protein, respectively.

The minimal condition for TALE activity is a thymine at the 5’ end of the target sequence. Further target sequence requirements that allow for one TALEN pair binding site every 35 bp (published by the Voytas lab in 20113) have recently been questioned by Reyon et al.4 In summary, it is very likely that you can find multiple potential TALE binding sites in any sequence you want to target. This, obviously, is very promising for biotechnological and clinical applications. Thus, two major classes of TAL Effectors have been created by replacing the natural acidic activation domain either by other transcription factors (TALE-TFs) 5 or by a monomer of the non-sequence specific nuclease FokI, resulting in TAL Effector Nucleases (TALENS).6 A pair of TALENs can be designed to bind adjacent DNA sequences in a way that the two monomers are able to form a functional FokI dimer that produces a double strand break (DBS) within the spacer between the TAL-Effectors (see figure 2).

Subsequently, the cell repairs the DBS by either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ, which results in indels at the DSB-site) or homologous recombination of exogenously added genetic material. That way, TALENs allow researchers to introduce genes into a genome with much higher efficiency than before. In this context, TALENs and TALE-TF have successfully been applied for manipulation of a series of genes in different organisms such as yeast7, tobacco3, fruitflies6,8,worms6,9, zebrafish10, rats11 and various human cell types, including human stem cells12. Moreover, TALENs are already applied for gene therapy in preclinical trials.
