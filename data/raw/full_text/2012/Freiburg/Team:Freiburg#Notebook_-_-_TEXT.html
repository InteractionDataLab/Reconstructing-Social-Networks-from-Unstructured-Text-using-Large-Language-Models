04/06 - 10/06
Golden-Gate-Cloning-Reaction (GGC) to assemble a 12-repeat-TAL-TF, that recognizes the sequence TACATTGGACCTAT
transformation: GGC-reaction
making aliquots of ordered GGC-Primers (freiGEM-method)
making aliquots of ordered, i.e. synthesized, direpeats
extension-PCR of direpeats in order to produce diefferent restriction sites for correct location of direpeats
PCR-Purification of extension-PCR
mutagenesis-PCR of Zhang-plasmid to remove restriction sites (SpeI, PstI, EcoRI, XbaI) --> making the plasmid work with iGEM-standard
11/06 - 16/06
optimizing PCR conditions for extension of direpeats
redoing GGC-reaction
transformation of redone GGC-reaction
GGC á la freiGEM --> transformation
testing of iGEM-distribution kit
17/06 - 23/06
cloning of direpeats into pJET 1.2 vector-system
colony-PCR of freiGEM-GGC product
place sequencing order for freiGEM-GGC
24/06 - 01/07
optimizing of freiGEM-GGC under various conditions
transformation of pJET-direpeats into bacteria
using the iGEM distribution kit: Bba_A12564 (CMV+Luc) --> reporter-plasmid for DNA-methyl-transferase testing
Miniprep of GGC-transformation (1 successful)
02/07 - 08/07
extension-PCR with all 96 direpeats on one well-plate
transformation
PCR-amplification of all 4 iGEM-backbones --> testing different conditions
making bacteria competent for transformation
09/07 - 15/07
digest of exDirepeats with XbaI and PstI
nanodrop of exDirepeats
ligation of exDirepeats in psB1C3 vector backbone and then transformation
colony-PCR, gel run, making cultures
miniprep of some of the 96 exDirepeats
16/07 - 22/07
transformation of synthesis products (Dnmt, hyperactive Gin, Gin L7C7, Tn3 and TAL-ORF) into DH10B-strain competent cells
amplification of psb1c3 vector backbone, then gel-run and gel-purification
picking of colonies (transformation of synthesis-products)
miniprep of synthesis-products
repeat of pcr-amplification of psb1c3 vector backbone
30/07 - 05/08
GGC to produce freiGEM-Mammo-Brick with CMV-promotor, Puromycin-resistance and postORF and TALEN-NG-vector backbone
to do so a extension-PCR on the parts was done
CMV-Promotor was taken out of iGEM Distribution Kit 2012
06/08 - 12/08
mutagenesis-PCR of pcb1c3 vector backbone to eliminate restriction site for BsmBI
repeat of GGC to get MammoBrick
gel-run of mutagenesis-PCR of psb1c3
13/08 - 19/08
repeating the assembly of MammoBrick vector containing CMV Promotor, PostORF-Part and Puromycin-ORF
repeating mutagenesis-PCR on vector backbone psb1c3
extPCR of TAL-ORF (synthesis-product) in order to produce a n-terminal kind of adapter to paste recombinase
producing an provisory mammalian expression vector --> cloning of TAL-ORF into mammalian vector backbone
to do so the vector and the insert have been digested and then ligated and transformed into dh10b e. coli strain bacteria
transformation of mutated vector backbone
colony pcr to test provisory mammalian expression vector
20/08 - 26/08
repeating mutagenesis pcr for vector backbone psb1c3 with another template
finding a new method for successful extension pcr and then digest and ligation into the psb1cr backbone
27/08 - 02/09
finding out that CMV promotor taken out of the registry distribution kit is not good at all
trying to get another vector with cmv promotor and ordering new primer pair to amplify it
after finding a working method for direpeat extension, digestion and ligation into psb1c3 vector backbone we now started to execute it on our synthesized direpeats
03/09 - 09/09
GGC-reaction in order to produce recombinase-linker-n-tal-orf construct
annealing of linker-part (was ordered as two single-strand primers)
after ggc-reaction was done a pcr-amplification on the new assembled part was executed
gel-run shows a very weak band at 2,7 kb for hyperactive gin recombinase
GGC-reaction in order to clone direpeats for a complete TAL-Domain into provisory mammalian expression vector
repeating the extextPCR on the recombinase-linker-n-tal-orf construct under different conditions after the first pcr reaction failed
amplification of mutated psb1c3 vector backbone
trying to clone Transcription Factor into provisory mammalian expression vector
repeating of GGC reaction in order to produce MammoBrick
still working on our toolkit, doing the final steps: sent them off for sequencing
10/09 - 16/09
doing the final steps in producing our toolkit: miniprep was done for the last three batches of direpeats, which can finally be sequenced on monday
we now have 75 successfully sequenced direpeats in the psb1c3 vector backbone, ready to send them off to igem headquarters
new working cmv promotor is now in psb1c3 vector backbone, too. we now have an improved, i.e. finally working, biobrick for the registry
