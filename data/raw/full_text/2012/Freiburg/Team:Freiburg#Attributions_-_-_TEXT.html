We are an independent iGEM team. This means that we did not have a lab advisor and did everything by ourselves. Moreover, we had no host lab but worked in course labs of the Department of Biology and BIOSS , which were empty during the summer break.
In detail, we did all of the following tasks on our own -
We have:
- founded a registered society in order to be allowed to raise donations
- raised money
- purchased lab equipment/ consumables
- poured agar plates, mixed media, autoclaved pipet tips etc.
- found our project idea - the GATE assembly method is truly our own invention. No professor told us what project to choose, what methods to use etc.
- planned the lab work
- done the actual lab work - everything was done by team members of the 2012 iGEM Team - over this summer, we were the only ones to enter "our" lab. No professor, no advisor etc.
- organised public outreach events, write our philosophical essay.
- had contact with the media
- planned our trips to the jamborees (booked flights, busses, hostels etc.)
- worked on our wiki and project movie
We thank the following people/ institutions for their support:
- all the people working at BIOSS that helped us with our problems answered patiently our questions.
- especially we want to thank the BIOSS Toolbox staff for all their kind help and support
- the Lab of professor Weber for helping us with the SEAP essay, the EPO essay and the cell culture
- we thank Konrad Müller (Weber Lab) for the SEAP test vector (pKM001).
- we thank Dr. Mussolino and Professor Cathomen for their TALEN test plasmids and advice.
- the Media Center of Freiburg University for printing our poster and lending us a camera for the project movie
- the Pahl Lab for giving us advice on the Chip Assay
- Addgene for their superb sequence analyzing and illustration tool.
- all our sponsors, in particular BIOSS and the University Hospital Freiburg, for their generous financial support
