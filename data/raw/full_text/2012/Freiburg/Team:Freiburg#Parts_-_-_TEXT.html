Parts
Our GATE Assembly Kit consists of 96 parts and different effectors like the transcriptionactivator VP64 and the nuclease Folk1. In short terms: Our team is sending more than 100 different well characterised and tested parts! This package will give all future iGEM teams the possibilty to produce TAL effectors in a really easy and fast way. Our parts are not only compatible with the iGEM standard, but moreover, throught the addition of two BSP1 restriction sites, also perfect for Golden Gate Cloning.
If you want to know more details about our Toolkit, please visit the Project section ! You can find a description of how we build our toolkit there .
