Abstract
We placed genes from fireflies and bioluminescent bacteria into E.coli. Codon optimisation and single amino acid mutagenesis allowed us to generate bright light output in a range of different colours. Future applications include  and quantitative biosensors and biological alternatives to conventional lighting.
