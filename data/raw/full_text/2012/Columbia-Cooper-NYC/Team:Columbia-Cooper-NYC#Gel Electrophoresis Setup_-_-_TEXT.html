Gel Electrophoresis Setup and Run Protocol
Note: The protocol is for creating 60ml of 1% agar gel used to run small DNA sequences of several hundred
To run gels for larger sequences (using the corresponding ladder), create a .7% agar gel
Measure .6g of ultra pure agar
Suspend agar in 60ml of TAE buffer
Place cap on bottle containing the solution
Set microwave for 120 seconds, let solution heat in microwave for first 45 seconds
Take out bottle and shake bottle and place back in microwave
Repeat step 5 every 10-15 seconds there after
After microwaving let solution stand to cool in hood Note: Do not let gel solidify
While cooling, rinse the gel mold with deionized water and make sure rubber gaskets are air tight and in place
Place well molds in place
Add .8µl Ethiolium bromide to TAE/agar mixture
Pour the mixture into mold and let it stand until hardens
To run the gels:
Gently remove wells from hardened gel
For every 5µl of DNA add 1µl of 6x loading dye Note: Need to add loading dye to each sample of DNA)
Add 7-8µl of 2 log ladder in first column
Place desired DNA for inspection in all the other columns
Run gel at steady 150V
