Solid Media Protocol
Solution A
Sterile filter solution with:
2 g of Na2S2O3
10 mL of H2O
Solution B
Autoclave solution of (2.5% tryptone):
2.5g tryptone broth
100 mL of H2O
Solution C
Sterile filter solution of:
500 mL deionized water
27 g (NH4)2SO4
0.9 g KCl
1.605 g leucine
4.5 g MgSO4
0.02 g HK2PO4
0.485 g diaminopimelic acid
~0.7 mL H2SO4 (or enough to bring pH down to ~2.0)
20 g Fe(II)SO4 (after adding everything else above)
Solution D
Autoclave solution containing (4% agarose):
20 g Agarose
500 mL distilled water
Heat up agarose solution until it becomes liquid
Pick a volume of solid media to make
Mix 1% vol A & 50% vol D, and 1% vol B & 48% vol C
Mix together AD and BC
Pour into petri dishes and allow to harden
