Future Directions
While our team learned a lot over the course of iGEM 2012, we still face a number of obstacles, which we hope to overcome in the near future. Our list of future goals includes:
Fusing FphA with other histidine kinase domains in order to build a precise, tightly controlled, photoreversible red light sensitive promoter system
Refining and solidifying a protocol for effective transformation of A. ferrooxidans
Modifying pJRD215 (the plasmid which we have been using with A. ferrooxidans), and possibly constructing a viable plasmid of our own design
Fine tuning our etching media in order to better facilitate our overall goal of creating an easy to use, easy to access, green process for the manufacture of printed circuit boards
