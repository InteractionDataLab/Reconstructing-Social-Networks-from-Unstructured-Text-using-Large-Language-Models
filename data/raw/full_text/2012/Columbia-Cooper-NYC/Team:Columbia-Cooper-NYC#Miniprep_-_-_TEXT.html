Plasmid Isolation Protocol
Following is a plasmid isolation protocol provided by QIAGEN:
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250µl Buffer P1 and transfer to a microcentrifuge tube
Add 250µl Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times
Add 350µl Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4-6 times
Centrifuge for 10 min. at 13,000 rpm in a table-top microcentrifuge
Apply the supernatant (from step 4) to the QIAprep spin column by decanting
Centrifuge for 30-60 seconds and discard the flow-through
Wash QIAspin column by adding 0.75ml Buffer PE and centrifuging for 30-60 seconds
Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge for an additional 1-3 minutes to remove residual wash buffer
To elute DNA, place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 50µl water to center of QIAprep spin column, let stand for 1 minute and centrifuge for 1-3 minutes.
