Optical Density Measurement Protocol
Preset temperature and wavelength for measuring the optical density
Read and reference 1mL control solution (e.g. if E. coli was grown in LB/CAM) placed in disposable cuvette
Place 10µl cells into 1mL solution
Read the absorbance
Make note that when reading the optical density, must be referenced by a reference solution
