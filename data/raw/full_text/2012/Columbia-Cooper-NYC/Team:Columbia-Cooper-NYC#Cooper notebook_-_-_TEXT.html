Cooper Union Kanbar Lab Notebook
August, 2012
Week 1
Tuesday, 14th
Created antibiotic CAM by mixing .250g of 25mg/ml of CAM powder with 10ml of EtOH
Pipetted 135µl of LB with 15µl of glucose to create growth media and placed in 37°C bath
Created two plates, one labelled control without IPTG and one with IPTG
Chemically transformed competent cells (DH5α) with IPTG induced GFP plasmid using bioline protocol
Plated 10µl of antibiotics, all of the transformed cells and 10µl of IPTG (did not place IPTG for control plate)
Placed in incubator 37°C overnight
Wednesday, 15th
Observed no growth for both plates
Concluded that possible lack of expression could be from a lack of a terminator
