Digestion Protocol for 3A Assembly Method
The following was protocol provided by bioworks:
Determine upstream part, downstream part and destination plasmid
Label three PCR tubes as U, D, P respectively
To each tube add 500ng of plasmid to be digested
Add necessary amount of water so final volume is 42.5µl
Add 5µl of NEBuffer 2 to each tube
Add 0.5µl of BSA to each tube
Add 1µl of first appropriate enzyme
Add 1µl of second appropriate enzyme
Ensure that digest is well mixed
Incubate the digests at 37C for 15 minutes in thermocycler
Incubate the digests at 80C for 20 minutes to deactivate the restriction enzymes
Store digest at -20C
