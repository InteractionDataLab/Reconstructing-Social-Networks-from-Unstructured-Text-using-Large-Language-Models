</P><CENTER><B>Liquid Media:</B></CENTER><P>1 liter of liquid media (AFM) was developed. 6 flasks were filled to the 100mL mark with AFM, with the intention of three flasks containing copper w/bacteria and the other three containing copper w/o bacteria. 32 uL of OD 0.0031 bacteria were added to the bacteria flasks after copper masses were measured. Two additional flasks were also used: one would be filled with 100mL of sulfuric acid (at pH 1.95) and a piece of copper without bacteria; the other would be filled with 100mL of deionized water and a piece of copper without bacteria. Two blank PCB pieces were also placed in two separate flasks. 10.3 uL of OD 0.0031 bacteria was added to one of the two flasks after the PCB masses were measured.The PCBs were covered with just enough media to fill the top of the copper surface, or at least we tried. The flasks with AFM were put into the shaker at 220 rpm, room temperature. The two PCB flasks were left sitting on the table next to the shaker in undergrad lab, not shaking.The water and sulfuric acid flasks were placed in a shaker at 225 rpm and 30 degrees C. 
Note that the amount of bacteria and the OD used were calculated such that we have an initial concentration of 1 x 10^-6 cells for the liquid media.
</P><CENTER><B>Solid Media:</B></CENTER><P>Calculations were first performed to determine the amount of solid media needed to place a thin layer (1 mL) so diffusion of ions can occur as quickly as possible. Calculations showed that we needed 7.85 mL per petri dish, but at the end, we used 12.85 mL of solid media to entirely cover the surface of each large petri dish with the copper samples submerged. We did this because of the inaccurate assumption that the copper samples were completely flat. The petri dish containing scratched copper pieces just had media on top of them. A total of 8 petri dishes (labeled 1 to 8) each containing 4 pieces of copper and 1 petri dish (labeled 9) containing 3 scratched copper were utilized. Calculations were done to see how to dilute OD 31 bacteria to OD 1. After calculations, 100 uL of OD 1 bacteria were placed into four petri dishes and spread around using beads. 20 uL of OD 1 bacteria were placed onto each scratched copper in petri dish 9. Dishes 2,5,7, and 8 have bacteria added. Whereas dishes 1,3,4, and 6 do not have bacteria. All the petri dishes were placed in an incubator at 29 degrees C and a beaker of water is in there to make sure they don’t dry out. On the first day, all the flasks and the petri dishes contained clear media with copper samples in them.</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_7">July 7</SPAN></H4><P>After removing the flasks containing AFM from the shaker, we noticed a rather obvious layer of whitish-yellow precipitate sitting at the bottom of the flasks. The flasks without AFM—the controls with the distilled water and sulfuric acid—did not contain this white precipitate. The source of the precipitation is unknown.
</P><CENTER><B>Measuring the Masses of the Samples in Liquid Media:</B></CENTER><P>The copper pieces were fished out of the solutions with tongs sterilized by heat. They were then rinsed off with water first then 70% ethanol solution. After drying the pieces with a kimwipe, we tried to smooth out the corners and flatten the piece out in order for its dimensions to be measured accurately. The copper pieces were then massed, and the results recorded. Once we found the masses, the copper pieces were placed back into their respective flasks.
</P><CENTER><B>Taking Optical Density:</B></CENTER><P>1 mL of basal AFM low pH solution was pipetted into a cuvette to serve as a blank. The cuvette was then placed in the spectrophotometer, which recorded the OD. The blank was used as a reference. 1 mL of the solution in the flask containing only AFM and copper was pipetted into a microcentrifuge tube. The tube was then capped and placed into a centrifuge for 2 minutes at 12,000g. The supernatant solution was pipetted out of the tube and disposed, leaving behind a white pellet of cells. The AFM solution in the cuvette prepared earlier was then pipetted into the tube and the solution was mixed within the container to ensure homogeneity in the solution. The liquid was then transferred back into the cuvette, where we made sure no large droplets were present on the sides of the cuvette and no bubbles were in solution before we placed it back in the spectrophotometer to record the OD. The solution in the cuvette and the cuvette itself were then discarded. Three trials were run for each sample of solution containing AFM (with and without bacteria). The precipitate mentioned earlier may have affected the OD readings of the solutions samples. 
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_8">July 8</SPAN></H4><CENTER><B>Liquid Media:</B></CENTER><P>The solutions in the AFM flasks were a dark, cloudy yellow color. The precipitate was a brownish-yellow color. The copper piece in the acid solution had become a dull dark pinkish color. The mass of the copper pieces in all the flasks with liquid media were taken, using the same procedure from the previous day. The ODs of the solutions were also taken using the same procedure as before.
</P><CENTER><B>Solid Media:</B></CENTER><P>The solid media sample #2 (containing bacteria), sample #4 (without bacteria), and scratched samples were removed from the incubator; the latter was removed just for picture taking and was placed back in the incubator shortly after. The gel in the petri dishes were stained ochre. The copper pieces were covered in green and surrounded by brown. The green layer and gel was washed away with water and 70% ethanol to reveal the un-etched copper pieces underneath. The copper pieces were then weighed and the masses recorded. 
Note that the the thickness of the media in the petri dishes were about  0.16 cm.
The ODs of the solid media samples could not be taken. We are discussing the possibility of doing controls with different amounts of bacteria in solid media. Data does not seem to make sense since the average percent loss from the sample w/o bacteria is greater than the one with bacteria. 
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_9">July 9</SPAN></H4><CENTER><B>Liquid Media:</B></CENTER><P>The solutions in the AFM flasks still retain a dark and cloudy yellow color. There are powdery precipitates on the bottom of each flask. The mass of the copper pieces in all the flasks with liquid media were taken, using the same procedure from the previous days. The ODs of the solutions were also taken using the same procedure as before. Over a period of 3 days, each of the 6 AFM flasks had a copper mass decrease of 30%. We therefore cannot tell whether the bacteria is actually etching the copper, as the rate of the dissolved oxygen etching the copper overshadows the rate of bacterial etching.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_11">July 11</SPAN></H4><CENTER><B>Liquid Media:</B></CENTER><P>Flasks were cleaned up because it seemed like the data from the controls were inconclusive. The experiment will be repeated with more bacteria in the flasks.
</P><CENTER><B>Solid Media:</B></CENTER><P>The solid media sample #6 (no bacteria), sample #8 (with bacteria), and scratched samples were removed from the incubator. The latter was removed just for picture taking and was placed back in the incubator shortly after. The copper pieces were covered in green and surrounded by brown. There are dark green-blue rings in the middle of some copper samples probably due to layered oxidation. The copper samples were washed away and massed using the same procedure as on 7/8/12. Again our data does not make sense because the average percent decrease for the copper samples without bacteria is greater than the average percent decrease for the copper samples with bacteria.  
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_14">July 14</SPAN></H4><CENTER><B>Solid Media:</B></CENTER><P>The solid media sample #3 (no bacteria), sample #5 (with bacteria), and scratched samples were removed from the incubator. The latter was removed just for picture taking and placed back in the incubator shortly after. The copper pieces were covered in green and some pieces were surrounded by blue especially the ones in the bacteria petri dish. The copper samples were washed away and massed using the same procedure as on 7/8/12. This time the data made sense because the average percent decrease for the copper samples without bacteria is less than the average percent decrease for the copper samples with bacteria. 
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_17">July 17</SPAN></H4><CENTER><B>Solid Media:</B></CENTER><P>The solid media sample #1 (no bacteria), sample #7 (with bacteria), and scratched samples were removed from the incubator. The copper pieces were covered in green and were enclosed by a blueish square. The copper samples were washed away and massed using the same procedure as on 7/8/12. Data did not make sense because the average percent decrease for the copper samples without bacteria is greater than the average percent decrease for the copper samples with bacteria. 
We made a plot of data points and interpolated curves (Look at Data and Conclusions Section). The data does not seem very reasonable since the solid media with no bacteria ended with a higher % decrease in copper mass than the solid media with bacteria. This may have occurred because of basal oxidation or perhaps bacteria accelerated the etching at around Day 7 and died at around Day 9. Thus, etching leveled off while basal oxidation continued almost linearly for the no bacteria case. Another possibility is that the data points do not make sense to actually make an interpolated plot for them. Either way, we need new data and new experiments.

The samples were then rinsed with 70% ethanol and dried with KimWipes. We made 1L AFM for later use. Labeled 12 petri dishes that had solid media(6 for bacteria and 6 for no bacteria, in which each dish has 4 pieces of copper). The masses of each copper sample were measured and recorded. Refer to the Summary of Tables for the masses of the copper samples. We could not finish set up because we do not have bacteria ready. Instead, we took a 1.2 mL OD 25.7 bacteria and diluted it to 10 mL of OD 3.08 bacteria. We placed 100 mL of the fresh AFM we made into each of our 9 flasks, and inoculated 1 mL of OD 3.08 bacteria into each flask for them to grow. We then placed the flasks in the shaker. It will only take one day for the bacteria to deplete the media because of the high starting OD. 
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_19">July 19</SPAN></H4><CENTER><B>Preparing Liquid and Solid Media:</B></CENTER><P>At the start of the lab session, 1 L of liquid AFM and 150 mL of solid AFM were created. Using the radius of the petri dish (5 cm), it was determined that in order to create a layer of solid media of about 1 mL high, 8 mL of solid media would be placed in each Petri dish.
The solid media was pipetted into pre-labeled dishes containing copper pieces. The temperature of the solid media dropped too quickly upon pipetting, however, and the media solidified before it could be spread evenly on the dish. In order to submerge the copper pieces in media, the solid media was pipetted onto the copper pieces, then the dish was tilted to promote spreading. The parts of some of the copper pieces that were not submerged (specifically 2.3, 2.4, 4.3, 5.2) began oxidizing only two hours after the solid media was added to the dishes. All the copper pieces in the Petri dishes also had air bubbles trapped underneath them.
100 mL of liquid media was pipetted into each of six pre-labeled flasks.
</P><CENTER><B>Preparing Cells:</B></CENTER><P>The cell cultures were retrieved from the undergraduate lab and placed into centrifuge bottles. The bottles centrifuged with a water balance for five minutes at 12,000 g.  Once removed from the centrifuge, the supernatant of the bottles was poured out. Masses of 9 microcentrifuge tubes were taken, labeled, and recorded. About 1 mL of liquid media was added to the pellet and the solution was transferred to the labeled microcentrifuge tubes. The tubes containing solution were massed. The tubes were microcentrifuged for 2 min at 12,000 g to better isolate the cells from the supernatant. We removed as much of the liquid as possible from the centrifuge tubes, leaving behind the pellet of cells. The tubes containing the pellet only was massed in order to determine the approximate mass of the bacteria in each tube.
</P><CENTER><B>Preparing Experiments:</B></CENTER><P>1 mL of AFM was added to the microcentrifuge tubes and the pellets were mixed into the media. One solution was pipetted into each of three liquid media flasks. Copper pieces were massed and one was placed into each of the six liquid media flasks. The remaining six solutions were pipetted into six petri dishes and then spread around the plate using beads. The petri dishes were placed into the incubator.

Flasks B2 and B3 contained solutions that were different shades of reddish-brown, while flask B1 contained a yellowish-green solution. The 3 flasks without bacteria all contained a clear, colorless solution.  The 3 copper pieces that were not exposed to bacteria-containing solution retained their original shape, color and finish. The 3 copper pieces that were exposed to solution containing bacteria appeared darker in color, tarnished and had crimpled edges.
Petri dish #1(containing bacteria) and Petri dish #7(did not contain bacteria) each contained 4 copper squares immersed in a solid medium. Before washing, the squares in dish #1 were covered in a dark green film. After washing with water and 70% ethanol, they appeared tarnished and were different shades of brown in different spots. Before washing, the squares in dish #7 were mostly covered light green-blue film. After washing with water and 70% ethanol, they also appeared tarnished and were different shades of brown in different spots.
</P><CENTER><B>Measuring the Masses of the Samples in Liquid Media:</B></CENTER><P>For the liquid media, the copper pieces were taken out of their respective flasks with sterile tongs and cleaned with deionized water and 70% ethanol. For the solid media, the copper squares were also cleaned with deionized water and 70% ethanol. They were then dried with a Kimwipe and their masses were obtained with an electronic balance. The copper squares for the liquid media were returned to their original flasks.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_21">July 21</SPAN></H4><P>The solid media Petri Dish #2 (w/ bacteria) and Petri Dish #8 (without bacteria) were removed from incubator. The gel in the petri dishes was stained ochre. Petri dish#2 copper pieces were covered by a yellow green-green square layers and surrounded by a brown copper color. Petri dish #8 copper pieces were covered by a blue green layer also surrounded by a copper color. The green layer and gel were washed away with water and 70% ethanol to reveal un-etched copper pieces underneath. The copper pieces were then weighed and the masses were recorded. We then found what the mass decrease was by comparing the masses before the experiment and the masses after the experiment.
</P><H4><SPAN class="mw-headline" id="July_22">July 22</SPAN></H4><P>We took measurements of the masses of copper in the liquid media and the two samples of the copper in solid media (see past trials for copper cleaning procedures). When the flasks containing AFM and bacteria were removed from the shaker, they appeared a dark muddy brown. The copper samples in the flasks were completely etched away, leaving trace amounts of copper pieces which we did not mass. The masses of the copper pieces in these flasks were assumed to be 0. The solutions in the AFM flasks not containing bacteria were a cloudy white. The copper samples in one of the Petri dishes, that had the solid media without bacteria, were coated in a uniform blue-green layer which may have been copper that was etched away. The copper samples in Petri Dish #4, which did contain bacteria, were covered in a patchier green-white layer. Note that sample 4.3 experienced some oxidizing even before bacteria was added to the dish during setup on Thursday. The distilled water and iron sulfate flasks had transparent green-tinted solutions.

All the samples were enclosed with a greenish surface. Look at our Data and Conclusion section for our plots showing the rate of copper etching.

The AFM solutions in the control dishes (not containing bacteria) were tinted a light blue, indicating that some of the cupric ions might have diffused through the solid media and into the liquid media. 

In the cases of the hybrid dishes containing bacteria, the greatest etching occurred in the cases where there was more AFM (liquid media). This is likely due to the fact that the increased amount of ferric ions in solution supported greater cell growth, which in turn spurred on faster etching.

In the cases of the dishes that did not contain bacteria, except for one case (copper piece 7.2), the etching remained fairly consistent, regardless of the amount of liquid media in the petri dishes.
