We graciously thank the following parties for helping to fund this year's IGEM project:
Columbia University Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.
The Cooper Union Joint Activities Committee for funding student clubs.
The Rose-Sandholm Biology Initiative to help us build up our laboratory offerings for students at The Cooper Union.
A special thanks to the following iGEM teams and people:
Dr. Scott Banta for overseeing our project, providing invaluable advice and allowing us to work in his lab at Columbia.
Dr. Alan West for his expertise in copper etching.
Dr. David Orbach for overseeing our project, generating novel ideas and approaches to our goal and allowing us to work in the Kanbar Center at Cooper.
Dionne Lutz for walking the genetic team through countless protocols, supervising our work in the Kanbar lab, helping organize our Maker Faire table and providing motivation and optimism.
Sudipta Majumdar for helping us construct plasmids and patiently teaching us new protocols.
Kevin Dooley for help with expression experiments, providing us with a GFP gene and identifying and removing cut sites within our biobrick and answering questions as we became acquainted with Dr. Banta's lab.
Tushar Patel for providing us with a GFP gene and answering questions as we became acquainted with Dr. Banta's lab.
Jason Candreva for being extremely patient with us, teaching us various transformation protocols with ecoli and ferrooxidans and answering every question we threw at him.
Sara Chuang for initializing the iGEM team.
iGEM Team Uppsala University for sending us the following parts: BBa_K592004, BBa_K592005, BBa_K592006, BBa_K592009, BBa_K592010, and BBa_K592016
iGEM Team ETH Zurich for sending us E. coli codon-optimized Pif3 and PhyB
Dr. Nicole Frankenberg-Dinkel for her advice and for sending plasmids pASK-fphAN753s and pTDho1
