Liquid Media Protocol
For 1 liter of liquid media:
Combine in a large beaker, while stirring with a magnetic bar:
1 L of distilled water
0.8 g of ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4
1.0 g of magnesium sulfate MgSO4
0.4 g of dipotassium phosphate K2HPO4
5.0 mL of MD-TMS
Using sulfuric acid (H2SO4), adjust pH of solution to 2.1. (This should take about 0.5 mL of H2SO4.)
Add 20 g of FeSO4*7H20
Using sulfuric acid, adjust pH of solution to 1.8-1.85
Once solution appears homogeneous, filter sterilize
