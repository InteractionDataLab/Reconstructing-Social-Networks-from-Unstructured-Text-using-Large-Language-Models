Intonation
The way we talk is always full of different combinations of intonation, thus making our speech or chat attractive. A speech without appropriate intonation may easily make listeners bored. Although intonation is somehow different among languages, the basic concept remains the same: putting your emotions into your words, making the words fill with power, and being confident to yourself.
Talking speed
This is also an important part when delivering a speech. With an appropriate speed, you can overwhelm listeners with your charm. An average talking speed is about 150 words per minute in English.
Eye contact
This is self-evident, so there's no need to explain it. Be calm, act naturally, get ready to dominate the floor!!
Passion
According to Dr. Chenistine, the formula for passion is:
$$ Passion=\frac{(love-hatred) \times willingness}{Tiredness} $$
Mind
