Team Introduction
Hello everyone, we are NTU-Taida team. This is our first year to join the iGEM family. We begin to recruit people from medical school, and seek help from modeling expertise from electronic engineering department, and technological supports from department of biotechnology. With close supervision of our advisors, help from a group of seniors in cancer research core lab, and financial supports from National Taiwan University, we can have so much space to prove our ideas and collect loads of data. We really enjoy working as a team and combat so many obstacles along the way. Most important of all, we all firmly believe that one day we can convert biotechnological advances into practice to help treat more people or make breakthrough in basic science.
