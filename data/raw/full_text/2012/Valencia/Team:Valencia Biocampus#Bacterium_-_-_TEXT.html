THE IDEA
We have developed a simple and fast method of determining "the comfort" of the bacterial culture by asking them four questions related with their metabolic state which are replied in the form of voice answers. Moreover, we have engineered another genetic construction to order them to produce a protein.  Here is an overview of how our bacteria work. For more information look the molecular mechanisms below.
