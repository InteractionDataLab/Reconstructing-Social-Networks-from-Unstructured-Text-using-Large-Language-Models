Lab Work
In this section we want to tell everybody our lab-experience.
We want to show you the part we sent to the registry (psbAI promoter) and its genetic characterization, sequence, elements, function, regulation and behaviour. Here you can know more about the construction and how it works.
The new BioBrick we have designed for the production of AHL during the night is explained here .
If you want know more about our lab-routine, don't forget glance through Notebook section. Have been three months full of anecdotes, and there can find the development of project, our decisions, the victories and failures or gladness and troubles.
Protocols is a part dedicated to show everybody our 'work planing'.
