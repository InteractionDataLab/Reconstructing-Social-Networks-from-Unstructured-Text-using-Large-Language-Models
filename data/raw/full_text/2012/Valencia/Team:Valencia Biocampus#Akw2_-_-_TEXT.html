Aknowledgements
We want to thank all those who, in one way or another, have made possible the realization of this project, contributing their resources and expertise.
First, we would like to thank to Universitat de València, Universitat Politècnica de València and CSIC, which have given us the opportunity to participate in this wonderful project. They have also given us an immeasurable economic support and have provided us their facilities. In addition, they have guided and advised us at all times.
We also would like to thank Universitas Bergensis, which has guided us in everything related to human practices, both in the realization of the short film as in the analysis of the ethical aspects of the project. They have also provided the necessary support for the production and improvement of the presentation.
Last but not least, we would like to gratefully acknowledge the dedication provided by Biopolis, which has helped us when it has been necessary, lending us its guidance, advice, facilities and time, as well as economic support.
Thank you all for making this wonderful experience possible!
