Team
We are an interdisciplinary group from Valencia composed by 12 students with backgrounds in biotechnology, biology, marine science and engineering. We come from three different universities (Universidad Católica de Valencia, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia and Universidad de Valencia) and have been working hard during the summer to present you our Synechosunshine. In the notebook page you can follow our adventures, and in the gallery page you can find more pictures about us!
