BG-11 medium
Reagents and Materials
Concentration BG-11:
1’5 g/L of NaNO3.
0’039 g/l K2HPO4•3H2O.
0’075 g/l MgSO4•7H2O.
0’02g/l Na2CO3.
0’027 g/l CaCl2.
0’01g/l  EDTA.
0’006 g/l ammonium Iron (III) citrate brown.
0’006 g/l citric acid anhydrous.
Micronutrients:
2,86 g/l H3BO3.
1,81 g/l MnCl2•4H2O.
0’222 g/l ZnSO4•7H2O.
0’391 g/l Na2MoO4•2H2O.
0’079 g/l CuSO4•5H2O.
0’0494 g/l CoCl2•6H2O.
Protocol
Dissolve all the compounds for the BG-11 in an Erlenmeyer flask in 1 liter of deionized water and shake at room temperature until all salts are dissolved.
Dissolve all the compounds for the micronutrients in an Erlenmeyer flask in 1 liter of deionized water and shake at room temperature until all salts are dissolved.
Add 1mL of micronutrients for every liter of BG-11.
Autoclave at 121ºC during 20 minutes.
When the liquid cools down, set the pH at 7’4 for Synechococcus elongatus to come from Harvard. In the other hand, set the pH at 8’9 for S. elongatus to come from Golden. [For the S. elongatus transformed with cScB the pH must be 8,9]
For solid medium add 3% agar.
