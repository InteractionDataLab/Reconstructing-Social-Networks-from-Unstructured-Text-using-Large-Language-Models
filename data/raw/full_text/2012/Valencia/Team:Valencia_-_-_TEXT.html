Synechosunshine: photosynthetically powered biolamp
We present an artificial consortium of two specialized bacteria by the means of synthetic biology, in order to obtain a photosynthetically fed biolamp. To achieve this we are modifying the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus to feed the population of Aliivibrio fischeri through a transporter protein and produce AHL to induce bioluminescence in response to the activity of a photosensitive operator, which would activate the systems only at night. We look forward to develop an efficient and autosufficient environmentally friendly biolamp, with potential application to cover the illumination needs of many industrial sectors and places where electricity is hard to get.

Modeling
We developed a synergic model based on complex molecular webs to predict the behavior and assess the optimum settings of the system for maximum light and control. Read more.
Human Practices
Lecture kids? Take advantage of the European Car-Free Day? We have been involved in really exciting activities for the human practices part. Take a look at them! Read more.
Team
Our team is composed of 12 crazy students with different backgrounds. We have been working hard during the summer to present you our Synechosunshine! Read more.
