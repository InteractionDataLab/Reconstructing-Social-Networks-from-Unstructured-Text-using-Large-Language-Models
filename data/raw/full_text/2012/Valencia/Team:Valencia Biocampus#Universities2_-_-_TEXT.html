Universities
University of Valencia
Our university, founded over five centuries ago by the Juries of Valencia, has become a modern, public university that teaches all areas of knowledge: social,  economic and legal sciences, experimental sciences, engineering, health sciences, educational sciences and humanities.
The university community is committed to being a university of reference: we are ranked second in Europe in receiving Erasmus students and fourth among Spanish  universities in research. According to the most prestigious international rankings, we are ranked fourth in Spain.
Polytechnic University of Valencia
The Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV)is a public educational institution that offers modern, flexible degrees that are designed to meet the demands of society,  as well as official postgraduate programmes that are subject to demanding educational quality control systems.
It has three campus sites: Vera (inside the city of Valencia), Alcoy and Gandia, with a total of 36.186 students, 2.843 members of teaching and research staff, and 2.396  administrative and services staff.
University of Bergen
The University of Bergen is Norway's urban university who is intricately woven into the geographical, historical and cultural framework of the city, with 14,500 students and 3,200 faculty and staff.
UiB has most of its premises concentrated in two areas. Årstadvollen is the University's "health campus", where dentistry, medicine and health-care lie close to the Haukeland and Haraldsplass university clinics. Natural and social sciences, psychology, the arts and law are taught at Nygårdshøyden, a mixture of houses, shops and seats of learning.
