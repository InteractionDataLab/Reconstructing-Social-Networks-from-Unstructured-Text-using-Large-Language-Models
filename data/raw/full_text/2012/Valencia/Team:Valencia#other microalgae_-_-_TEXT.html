Our aims go beyond building the most efficient  photosynthetic biolamp, into trying to develop more robust and  simple designs based on bioluminescent vascular plants. These kind  of biolamps would be less energy-efficient, due to the lower  surface-volume quotient and amount of structural carbon, but would  be much easier to transport, manage, upkeep and commercialize.  Vascular plants are robust organisms with a wider tolerance to  changes in environmental conditions and independent of a broth  vessel and complex tube systems (as they have their own biological  structures for this function - xylems and phloems).
In first place, we would test of luminescence of S.  elongatus WT with psbA-luxAB as grown broth biolamp, to assess the  magnitude of the problem of pigment shading of luminescence.
The next step would be the transformation of  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii's chloroplast with the lux cassette under  ligth regulation .
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii:
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  is haploid unicellular green algae. It is about 10 micrometers long  and 3 wide and has two flagella. Much of its volume is occupied by  its only chloroplast which has 80 copies of its genome.  Chlamydomonas can grow by autotrophic or heterotrophic ways using  organic carbon and chemical energy sources.
This alga is widely spread  around the world and is one of mostly used laboratory organism. It  is used as model in studies of cellular movement, environmental  stimuli responses and photosynthetic and cellular recognition  studies.

In the industry this algae  has been used on different areas such as: biofuels production (lipid  for biodiesel), biorremediation (heavy metals subtraction from  water), pigment production (carotenoids) and bioreactor for  production of recombinant proteins for medical use. This is due to  some of its features as easy and cheap culture, great capacity of  store biomass and because commonly it is considered non harmful for  human beings.

Experimental design:
Genetic circuit:
The designed genetic circuit is very similar to    the one that is employed at co-culture project. In this one the    psbA promoter regulates λ production; and this production of λ regulates the expression of lux operon.
During the day the presence of CI repressor    inhibits the expression of lux operon because alga does not emit    light.
Figure 2: Genetic circuit working in presence of light/during the day
During night λ product is not present and that    allows the expression of lux operon and the following light    emission.

Transform Chlamydomonas reinhardtii:
The psbAI gen is a chloroplast's gen. The reasons    why we chose to transform chloroplast genome of Chlamydomonas    reinhardtii are exposed in the next table:
Table 2: Comparison of nucleus manipulation against chloroplast manipulation
Strain selected:
With the intention of avoiding the use of    antibiotics at selection of transformed cells we decided to employ    the photosynthesis-deficient mutant strain ac-uc-221 (CC373) of C.    reinhardtiii.
The ac-uc-2-21 is a deletion mutation in the    chloroplast atpB gen, which results in a clean, non-reverting    acetate-requiring phenotype. This strain was originally obtained    from the culture collection of the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center    at Duke University, NC, USA
The use mutant strain CC373 enables the selection    of transformed cells employing vectors which carry the DNA of    interest between plastome homologous regions and atpB gen. The    atpB gen allows the restoration of a complete atpB gen copy. Then    transformed cells will be able to grow in a culture medium without    acetate and high light conditions while not transformed will not    do.
Vector selected:
To introduce our construction and complement the    deletion mutation ac-uc-2-21 we chose to use plasmid pCrc +157 (Inger    Lill Anthonisen, 2002). This plasmid has between its has    between inverted repeats homologous to plastome, regions XhoI and    XbaI restriction sites flanking 5' rbcL (el promotor), uidA gen    and 3' UTR from psaB (to stabilize transcripts).Apart it has atpB    gen.
This plasmid has between its two regions with    inverted repeat sequences homologous to plastome, targets for    restriction enzymes Xhol and Xbal. Between these targets there is    the uidA gen flanked by the rbcL 5' UTR and the psaB 3' UTR (this    last stabilizes the transcripts). Out of these sequences it has    the atpB gen.

Method selected:
Chlamydomonas´ chloroplast can be    transformed by different ways. The most prefered are    Polyethilenglicol and gen gun methods. We chose gun gen because we    found more literature explaining it. This consists on adhering    your construction to gold or tungsten particles. After that you    will shot them to your algae culture (in agar plates) at empty    conditions.
Bullets will: - Fall and not hit algae. - Kill    algae. - Break through algae. - Hit the chloroplast and transform    it. As with all chloroplast transformation methods the    introduction of desired DNA will be done by homologous    recombination.
Future
This opens the way for further research on    eukaryotic chloroplast transformation that can lead to the    development of glowing trees on boulevards (see Team Cambridge    2011).
The last experimental step would be the    transformation of Tobacco plant cell with psbA-lux cassette and    development of a protoplast. The protoplast can be grown into a    callus, from which we can finally obtain a bioluminescent plant.
