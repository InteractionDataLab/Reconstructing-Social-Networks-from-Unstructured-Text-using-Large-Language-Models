BG-11 for Wildtype in medium liquid.
Reagents and Materials
Concentration BG-11 200X*:
8 g/l de K2HPO4•3H2O.
8 g/l de Na2CO3.
15 g/l de MgSO4•7H2O.
0,2 g/l de Na2EDTA.
7,2 g/l de CaCl2•2H2O.
1,2 g/l de ammonium Iron (III) citrate brown.
1,2 g/l de citric acid anhydrous.
Concentration trace metal 1000X*:
2,86 g/l de H3BO4.
1,81 g/l de MnCl2•4H2O.
222 mg/l de ZnSO4•7H2O.
390 mg/l de Na2MoO4•2H2O.
79 mg/l de CuSO4•5H20.
49 mg/l de CoCl2•6H2O.
Protocol
Add all the compounds for the BG-11 in an Erlenmeyer flask with 1 liter of distilled water and shake at room temperature until all salts are dissolved.
Add all the compounds for the trace metal in an Erlenmeyer flask with 1 liter of distilled water and shake at room temperature until all salts are dissolved.
In 1 liter of distilled water, put 1 Ml of trace metal and 5 ml of BG-11 and add 17’5 Mm of NaNO3.
Autoclave at 121ºC during 20 minutes.
Add 10 Mm of Hepes of NaOH to set the Ph=7’8 (1 M Hepes NaOH = 700 Ml distilled water, 283’3 g Hepes, ≈ 5’5 g NaOH).
