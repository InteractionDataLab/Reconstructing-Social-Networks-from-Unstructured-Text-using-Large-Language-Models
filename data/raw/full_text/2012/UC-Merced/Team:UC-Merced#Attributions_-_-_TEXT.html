UC Merced Advisors
Marcos Garcia-Ojeda, a professor for the School of Natural Sciences has provided us with his insight and intellectual knowledge throughout the whole project. He has graciously provided his lab space to the team and taught us proper lab techniques and protocols. He stressed communication between each other is necessary to make sure the project is running smoothly. Finally, he has helped us in finalizing our project idea to make sure we had decided on a project that we would enjoy, as well as ensure we were trained properly in lab procedures.
Wei-Chun Chin, a bioengineering professor for the School of Engineering, who has helped us in developing the project ideas and process during the brainstorming sessions early in our project considerations. During the brainstorming sessions his knowledge has guided us towards a project that would be appealing to the mass.
Financials
We want to thank School of Engineering and School of Natural Sciences. They have graciously helped us out in funding for our laboratory supplies. We want to specifically like to thank Dean Hirleman and Dean Meza for giving us the opportunity recalling from last semester that we had to pitch the idea of forming a UC Merced iGEM team. Without their help and the help of the school now of the experiments we done in the laboratory would be possible.
The registration for both the team registration and the team members regional jamboree attendance fee has been funded by the Associated Students of the University of California Merced (ASUCM). ASUCM is here to help the students by promoting the enhancement of the academic benefits and opportunities offered for the  continues of students at UC Merced.
Laboratory Related
The Departement of Microbiology at Oregon State University, specifically the Giovannoni Lab has provided us with Methylophilales bacterium HTCC2181.It is an Isolate of OM43, a cluster of one of the most abundant beta-Proteobacteria in coastal marine 16S clone libraries. Amy Carter has been the logistics person whom we have spoken to about receiving the bacteria and deserves a special thanks.
UC Davis iGEM team has helped us by providing a lot of insightful knowledge as they are an experienced team. They also pointed us towards the Gibson Assembly Method and said because we are are a rookie team, we should establish little milestones to characterize success.
Primers were designed by students and produced by Eurofins. Protocol kits were obtained from Fisher Scientific, and restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs.
Yale University and the E. Coli Genetic Stock Center (CGSG)has helped by providing two strains of E. Coli which are FMJ39 and JW1228. These are the two strains where we are using to provide as hosts for our hydrogen E. Coli. Without Yale’s CGSC and the ability to mutate and knockout specific genes our project would not be able to succeed as it is a basis for our hypothesis.
