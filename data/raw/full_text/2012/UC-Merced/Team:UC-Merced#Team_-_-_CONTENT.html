I will be obtaining a B.S. in Molecular Biology and a B.S. in Materials Science Engineering this coming May. I have a vast background in research. I started when I was a Senior in high school and it includes: botany/horticulture, fungicide research, agriculture research, stem cell, genomic annotation, and polymer synthesis and characterization. I plan to enter industry after graduation and pursue bio-materials fabrication and research.

Bioengineering. Being part of UC Merced has given me the opportunity to become part of new organizations such as being a charter member of Theta Tau and obviously starting up the first iGEM team here!  My hobbies including cooking, baking, and well obviously eating! After graduating I plan to explore this world we live in and eventually end up interning and jumping ship to graduate school.

Having to do independent research and integrating all the knowledge I have gained as an undergraduate -that's something that got me really excited. I am currently studying Biological Sciences at UCMerced with a minor in Applied Mathematics. First and foremost, I plan to Graduate. As a long term goal, I plan to pursue a career in medicine where I can combine my love of science with my ambition to help others. I am interested in research in the medical field -particularly neuroscience.

I am really interested in genetic engineering especially after taking a biotechnology course. I am motivated to achieve great things with my education and venture onto some innovative work in the future. On my leisure time hanging out with friends, playing games, and going to the gym is a great way to spend it.

My name is Marwin Ko. I currently attend UC Merced as a Bioengineering major. In addition to iGEM, I am a member of the professional engineering fraternity, ΘΤ and international fraternity, ΚΣ. In my spare time I work as a research assistant under Professor Chin investigating scaffolding methods via electrospinning. When I graduate I plan to pursue my masters in mechanical engineering and then eventually a doctorate in electrical engineering. My goal is to work on research that will help re-engineer current mechanical systems using biological systems as a template.

I have never been involved in iGEM before, but I am very excited to be participating this year.  I enjoy the biological sciences, particularly physiology and the interaction of drugs with bodily invaders.  I am positive that iGEM will be a great opportunity to learn about genetic biology and to develop my research skills. My interests outside of academia include playing basketball, traveling and consumer technology.

My name is Catherine Vu. I am a Biological Sciences major with an emphasis in Human Biology. As a fourth year student at UC Merced, my undergraduate journey has helped to shape my future goals of further studies in biomedical and health sciences. I am excited to participate in iGEM with the hope that I may in some small way contribute to iGEM’s potential impact on our diverse society. My other research interest is in community-engaged research. I feel that both laboratory and community perspectives provide a rich complement to my education and help to broaden my understanding of our complex and changing world. In my free time, I enjoy outdoor adventures, travel, music, and discovering something new every day.
