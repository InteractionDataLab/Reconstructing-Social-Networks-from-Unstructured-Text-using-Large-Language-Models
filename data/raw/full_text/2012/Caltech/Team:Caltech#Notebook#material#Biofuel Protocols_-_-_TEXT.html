Ethanol Color Assay Reaction
Materials
water
1.0M bicine (pH 8.0)
40 mM EDTA
10 mM NAD
4.2 mM thiazolyl blue
16.6 mM phenazine ethosulfate
1 mg/mL alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme
ethanol
Method
Make a master mix consisting of:
3.6 mL water
1.2 mL bicine
1.2 mL EDTA
1.2 mL NAD
1.2 ml thiazolyl blue
2.4 mL phenazine ethosulfate
Before running the experiment, add 1.2 mL of alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme.
Pipette 5 uL of sample into the 96-well microtiter plate.  Add 95 uL of master mix.   Measure absorbance at 570 nm.  We found that the maximum absorbance of each well occurred at a different time relative to the concentration, so it is best to run a series of measurements over a period of approximately 4 hours.

MOPS Buffer
We used the recipe from Teknova listed here but substituted 10 ml of 20% glucose for 8 ml of 50% glucose.  Mix all the following ingredients together to get MOPS buffer:
100 ml 10X MOPS Mixture
10 ml 0.132 M K2HP04
100 ml 10X ACGU
200 ml 5X Supplement EZ
582 ml Sterile H20*
8 ml 20% Glucose
