From iGEM: An important aspect of the iGEM competition is the use and creation of standard  biological parts. Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will place them in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts . The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created . The "groupparts" tag will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.  Note that if you want to document a part you need to document it on the Registry , not on your team wiki.  Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part such that it can be used without a need to refer to the primary literature. The next iGEM team should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for  users who wish to know more.
Caltech iGEM submitted three parts to the parts registry: mCherry-AAV, mCherry-LVA, and proteorhodopsin.  The first two contain the mCherry fluorescent protein and are attached to a degradation tag.  The degradation tags differ by their last three amino acids (either AAV or LVA).  We developed the mCherry constructs to assist in our animation collaboration with CalArts (see Human Practice for more detail).  The proteorhodopsin, derived from marine bacteria, is a light-activated proton pump which when induced can contribute a proton motive force to the cell, potentially easing some of the burden on the electron transport chain in making ATP.  Go to our characterization page to learn more about our constructs.
