Transformed M30109 and R0082, M30109 had 3 colonies and R0082 had none.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
6/25/12
Re-transformed R0082, but with no colonies.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
6/26/12
Ran PCR of R0082 with OneTaq polymerase, gel had no band.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
6/27/12
PCR R0082 with vf2 and vr primers and Phusion polymerase. Gel had confirmed band length. PCR purified and had 34.6 ng/ul.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
6/28/12
Both R0082 and positive control plates had colonies. Transformed RFP (E1010) and lacZ and plated.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
6/29/12
PCR lacZ and pVH001 (mCherry-AAV Victoria's construct) and ran gel with correct band length for lacZ. There is lacZ DNA, but past lacZ transformations have not worked. Miniprepped overnight cultures of R0082 (43.6 ng/ul) and M30109 (28.9 ng/ul).
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/2/12
Transformed lacZ again and sent R0082 and M30109 for sequencing. Started overnights of R0082, E1010, and MG1655.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/3/12
We transformed pSBC13 into Mg1655 on 3 different plates. We put 1 microliter of Mg1655 on 1 plate, 10 microliters on the second plate, and 100 microliters on the third plate, in order to figure out which one would make the best looking plate of red E. coli.  We also miniprepped samples of R0028 and E1010.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/5/12
We double digested R0082, lacZ, and E1010 (RFP). We ran the digested samples on a gel along with undigested samples of each to make sure the digests worked. The lacZ and the E1010 digests were successful, but the gel results on the R0082 were inconclusive.  We also transformed pSBC13 into Mg1655, but the LB was contaminated so we did not plate the culture.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/6/12
We started another culture for M1655 since our previous culture was made with contaminated LB.  Then we re-digested the R0082 and ran a gel comparing the digested R0082 with the undigested. The digest was successful, so tested the concentrations of DNA in the R0082, the E1010, and the lacZ samples with the Nanodrop.  There was not a high enough concentration of the E1010 DNA, so we could not use it in ligation.  We ligated the R0082 with the E1010 and plated the plasmid.  Also, we ordered primers for mCherry-AAV, mCherry-LVA, and mCherry.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/9/12
We found that there was growth on the ligation plate and no growth on the negative control plate, which was good.  We checked to make sure that the ligation of R0082 and E1010 worked by running a PCR of 6 different colonies on the ligation plate as well as a sample of the undigested R0082 and then running a gel of these things.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/10/12
Started 5 cultures of ligated colony of RFP and R0082 to shake for 5-6 hours and then streak out on plates. Ran gel of lacZ PCR product.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/11/12
Ran gel to check lacZ digest, and PCR purified. PCR mCherry-AAV/LVA  and streaked plate of M30109.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/12/12
Ran gel for mCherry, PCR purified mCherry, M30109 had no colonies. Started overnights for R0082.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/13/12
To do: Digest mCherry and R0082, run gel to make sure. PCR purify, then ligate mCherry+R0082 and lacZ+R0082
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/16/12
Ligated R0082 with lacZ, mCherry-LVA, mCherry-AAV and plated. Transformed another lacZ part (BBa_I732019).
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/17/12
There was growth on the lacZ, mCherry-AAV, and mCherry-LVA ligation plates. We did a colony pcr and re-struck colonies for these plates as well as for the E1010-R0082 ligation plate.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/18/12
We ran a gel on the colony pcrs of the lacZ, mCherry-AAV, mCherry-LVA, and E1010 ligation plates.  The gel showed that the ligations had apparently not worked, so we re-digested the mCherries and the R0082 to start over the process of ligation.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/19/12
We ran a gel on the digests of the mCherries and R0082, and it appeared to have worked, so we ligated mCherry-AAV + R0082 and mCherry-LVA + R0082, then ran a gel.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/20/12
We re-did a ligation on the mCherries and R0082 because it appeared from the gel that the ligation from Friday did not work.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/23/12
Ran a gel of re-ligated R0082 and mCherry-LVA,mCherry-AAV.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/24/12
Plated the mCherry ligations 2, 3, and negative control.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/24/12
The four mCherry ligations plates have colonies and the negative control plate has some, but not many compared to the ligated colonies. Colony PCR on the ligations and negative control. PCR mCherry-LVA and mCherry-AAV with dpn1 digest? Make plates with agar embedded.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/25/12
Ran a gel and imaged the ligations and confirmed the ligations worked. Overnights of ligation for miniprep for tomorrow morning.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/26/12
Started overnight cultures of mCherry ligations with varying salt concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5, .75, 1 mol NaCl) and one growing in water. Sent mCherry ligations off for sequencing.
Back to Coliroid Notebook Calendar
7/27/12
Overnight cultures have no apparent redness, looked at cultures with plate reader for any RFP, but there is very little which may be background. The RFP created may have been degraded by the degradation tags.
