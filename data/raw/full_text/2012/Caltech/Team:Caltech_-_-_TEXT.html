Biofuels and Bacterial Animations
The Caltech 2012 iGEM team's project focused on manipulating bacteria to degrade stable organic polymers such as lignin and alginate; using these substrates to synthesize biofuels, specifically ethanol; and directing their ATP synthesis mechanism to rely on proteorhodopsin as the source of the proton gradient, freeing NADH to interact in the synthetic pathway.  Caltech also collaborated with California Institute of the Arts to create an animation using a plate of E. coli transformed with mCherry plasmid.  To learn more about our collaboration, view our Human Practice page.
