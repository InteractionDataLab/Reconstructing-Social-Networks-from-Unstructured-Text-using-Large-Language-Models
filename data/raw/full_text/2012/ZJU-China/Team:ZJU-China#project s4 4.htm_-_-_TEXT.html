Future Work
After the chain polyscaffold is completed, we expect to design and assemble crosslinking polyscaffolds which have network structures instead of linear structures.
If other kinds of basic scaffolds are available, it will be possible to gain a co-polyscaffold which contains two or more kinds of monoscaffolds. In this way, more types of enzymes can bind to the co-polyscaffold and the acceleration of a multi-enzyme pathway can be achieved.
