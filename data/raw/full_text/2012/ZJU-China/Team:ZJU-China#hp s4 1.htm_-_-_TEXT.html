Dr. Yuhua Hu from Edinburgh University visiting our team
Dr. Yuhua Hu, the technologies manager of school of biology sciences, the university of Edinburgh, visited our team on August first. We briefly introduced our team and project to her. And she described the project and recent progress of Edinburgh team. Then we talked about the collaboration between two teams, and hoped to build a strong connection in the long run. We are all looking forward to the future collaboration of iGEM teams and students associations between Zhejiang University and Edinburgh University!
