6. IAM pathway
(Group: iGEM2011_Imperial)
 
Assessment:
 
Five pathways described above all have some drawbacks, finally, only one pathway left, IAM pathway. The two-step IAM pathway generates indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) from the precursor tryptophan. IAA tryptophan monooxygenase (IaaM) catalyses the oxidative carboxylation of L-tryptophan to indole-3-acetamide, which is hydrolysed to IAA and ammonia by indoleacetamide hydrolase (IaaH).
