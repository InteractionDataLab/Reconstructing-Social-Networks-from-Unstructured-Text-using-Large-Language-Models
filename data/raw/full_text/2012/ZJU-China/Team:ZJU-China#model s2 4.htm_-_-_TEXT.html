Additional effects
1. Effect of enzymes concentration
From the above discussion, we assumed the concentration of enzymes is constant. However, the increasing concentration of enzymes also results in the increasing of reaction rate. The difference between scaffold and non-scaffold system varies when the concentration of enzymes increase.
 
We select the number of E1 and E2 for 10, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, 280, 320 and 360 to record the number of C after 1200 iterations.
Fig 7. The number of B and C vary according to the concentration of enzymes.
 
From figure 7, we find that when the concentration of enzymes is too low and too high, the difference between scaffold and non-scaffold system is not noticeable. Only when the concentration of enzymes is at a certain range of value, the advantages of scaffold system is significant. It seems reasonable that when the concentration is too low, the reaction rate is also low. When the concentration is too high, the probability that B meets an E2 is approximately equal for both systems.
2. Effect of distance between two enzymes
The distance between two enzymes E1 and E2 on RNA scaffold has an influence on reaction rate of pathway. If the E1 and E2 are closer, the probability that B, that is generated from A, meets an E2 is high for the reason that the distance between B and E2 are close. When the distance between E1 and E2 are getting further, the number of C is declining.
Fig 8. The amount of C varies according to the distance between E1 and E2
 
From figure 8, it is easy to figure out that as the distance between E1 and E2 increasing, the final number of C is decreasing.
