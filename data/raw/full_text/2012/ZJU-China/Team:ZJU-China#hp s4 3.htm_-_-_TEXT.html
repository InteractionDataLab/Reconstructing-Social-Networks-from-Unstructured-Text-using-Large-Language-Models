Terrific trip to UIUC
One of our team members, Xinyi Guo, reached out to the UIUC team and coincidentally discovered that both of our teams focus on RNA scaffold this year. The fact that we are all interested in developing RNA scaffolds as a full comprehensive project made us excited, and we had a deep talk about both our projects and specifically exchange ideas in  scaffold characterizations.
