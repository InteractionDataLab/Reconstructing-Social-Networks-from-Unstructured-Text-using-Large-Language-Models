Design
We designed a monoscaffold, which is gained by adding a sequence to the 5’ end of the basic scaffold. The sequence is complementary to the spare loop in the basic scaffold. We expect the monoscaffolds to polymerize in a head-tail way due to the base complementation between the added sequence in one of them and the spare loop in another, and thus a chain polyscaffold is formed.
Fig.1 A head-tail connected chain polyscaffold.
The base sequence of our designed monoscaffold is as follows. The complementary bases in the head-tail connection are shown in blue:
