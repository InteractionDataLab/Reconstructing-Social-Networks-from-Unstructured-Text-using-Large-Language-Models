In previous work, FA and FB are used to indicate the efficiency of riboscaffold. In order to further prove the function of riboscaffold, we plan to substitute FA, FB with functional enzymes or protein substrates like ferredoxin in hydrogen producing pathway respectively.
 
Considering the availability of material and abundant parts distributed by iGEM, we search the 2012 kit plate1-5 to find optimal pathways. After a pre-selection, six pathways are on candidate list. For sake of experimental feasibility, we perform a further selection based on several caritas as follows:
 
1. Product is easy to detect and measure;
 
2. Substrate is easy to get;
 
3. Product is beneficial to human;
 
4. The length of amino acid sequence of enzyme is optimal to be fusion protein;
 
5. Two proteins involved in the basic pathway.
