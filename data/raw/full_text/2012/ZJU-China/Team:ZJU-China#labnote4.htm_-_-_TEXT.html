Week 4 (07.09-07.15): Make our own biobrick parts
July 09
Prepare liquid SOB medium for co-transformation.
July 10
Amplify glycerol stock bacteria FB (DH5α) on plates.
July 11
1. Identify FA and FB with PCR.
2. Amplify FB-7-10-plate bacteria in liquid LB medium.
July 12
1. Miniprep plasmid of pCJDFB from bacteria of July 06.
Name: FB-7-11      Concentration: 15.4 ng/ul         A260/280: 1.88
2. Amplify FB-7-10-plate1, FB-7-10-plate2, FA-6.29-liq (DH5α), FA-lix and FB-lix bacteria for minipreparing plasmids later.
3. Identify FB with PCR again.We found there were problems with primers used in those reactions, thus leading to the failure.
4. Ligation: D0 and pSB1C3, purified at July 08.
July 13
1. Transformation:
No.name  time of heat shock/s
1  D0-FA-FB 90
2  FA-FB 90
3  D0-FA-FB 30
4  FA-FB 30
5  ligation product 90
6  D0 90
2. Miniprep plasmid of FA and FB from bacteria of July 12.
Name: FA-7-13-1-1      Concentration: 15.8 ng/ul         A260/280: 1.89
Name: FA-7-13-1-2      Concentration: 10.8 ng/ul         A260/280: 2.06

Name: FA-7-13-lix       Concentration: 13.3 ng/ul         A260/280: 2.08
Name: FB-7-13-yy       Concentration: 26.4 ng/ul         A260/280: 1.84
July 14
1. Co-transformation:
No.name  time of heat shock/s
1  D0-FA-FB  90
2  D0-FA-FB  30
Use SOC liquid medium.
2. Miniprep plasmid of FA and FB from bacteria of July 12.
Name: FB-7-14-1       Concentration: 42.9 ng/ul         A260/280: 0.67
Name: FB-7-14-2       Concentration: 21.0 ng/ul         A260/280: 2.69
Name: FB-7-14-3       Concentration: 44.7 ng/ul         A260/280: 0.59
Name: FB-7-14-4       Concentration: 14.4 ng/ul         A260/280: 2.09
Name: FB-7-14-5       Concentration: 33.1 ng/ul         A260/280: 0.68
Name: FB-7-14-6       Concentration: 26.1 ng/ul         A260/280: 1.64
3. Amplify glycerol stock bacteria co-transformation (BL21*(DE3)) on 3 resistance plates, glycerol stock bacteria D0 on Amp plate.
4. Amplify FB-7-12-2, FB-7-12-4, FA-7-12-2-2 and FA-7-12-2-3 in LB liquid medium, named FB-7-14-2, FB-7-14-4, FA-7-14-2-2 and FA-7-14-2-3.
5. Digest FA-7-13-2-2, FA-7-13-2-3, FB-7-14-2 and FB-7-14-4 with Pst1.
Maybe the concentration is too low that we can't recognize it.
