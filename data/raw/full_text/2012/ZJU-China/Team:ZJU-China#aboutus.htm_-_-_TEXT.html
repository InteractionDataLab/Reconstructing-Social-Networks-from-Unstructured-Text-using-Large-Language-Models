ABOUT US
01 ABOUT ZJU
The University Motto: Seeking the Truth and Pioneering New Trails.
 
The history of Zhejiang University goes back to 115 years ago. As a truly comprehensive institution with a full range of disciplines, Zhejiang University covers lots of subjects and aims at providing an outstanding education that will enable its students to build a future of professional, intellectual and personal success, capable of leadership in different areas, whether it be political, economic or academic.
 
We have five campuses. The names are: Yuquan, Xixi, Huajiachi, Zhijiang, and Zijingang. These names are all "water" related. In English, they mean spring, stream, pool, river, and port. Each campus has its own beauty. Yuquan is charming, Xixi is elegant, Huajiachi is simple, Zhijiang is ancient and Zijingang is modern. For more information, click http://www.zju.edu.cn
 
Here we want to show you a set of amazing photos shot by Gang Cheng, an alumnus of Zhejiang University.
