Experience a Real iGEM Lab Life
 
Want to be a scientist and experience a real iGEM lab life? ZJU-China also provides you that opportunity! After the visiting of Hangzhou No.2 High School, we received emails from a high school student, Xin-he Shan, who expressed an interest in participating. He and his classmate, Wen-zhou Chen, visited our lab in summer. And we gave them short lab training about safety on July 12, 2012. And they start to apply what they learn in class to real lab practice.
 
One of our experiencer Xiaoting Lu, who majored in animal science, joined the 3rd Animal Science and Life Science Hangzhou Summer Camp. This summer camp intended to promote the undergraduates’ understanding of cutting-edge science focusing on animal and Life aspect, which attracted lots of outstanding undergrads to apply from all over the nation since its first year, and it lasted for 5 days (from July 7,2012 to July 12, 2012). There was a section for the campers to exchange their academic experience, and our college experiencer Xiaoting choose her experience as a intern in our lab and synthetic adventure as the content of presentation.
