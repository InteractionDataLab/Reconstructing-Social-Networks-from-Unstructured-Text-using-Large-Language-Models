1. Salicylate pathway
(Group: iGEM2006_MIT)
 
Assessment:
 
The characterization method of gas chromatography is difficult to perform. First, what can be analyzed is methyl salicylate production, that is to say, another enzyme should be co-transformed to E.coli too, which will increase cell’s burden and reduce the ratio of successful co-transformation. Second, it is not convenient for us to borrow the relative machine.
