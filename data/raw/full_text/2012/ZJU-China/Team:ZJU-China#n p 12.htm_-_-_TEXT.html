12 Growth Curve:
 
12.1 Set up cells culture in ~2mL LB + antibiotic.
 
12.2 Grow at 37℃, 250 rpm overnight.
 
12.3 Dilute in LB + antibiotic so that final OD600 is ~0.05 for each culture.
 
12.4 Take OD600 of freshly dilute cultures. Another dilution may be necessary.
 
12.5 Grow at 37℃, 250 rpm.
 
12.6 Take OD600 at 30mins.
 
12.7 Once OD600 has reached ~0.1, begin taking ODs every 20mins.
 
12.8 When OD600 =0.2， split cultures in half and induce half with 2mM IPTG.
 
12.9 Once an OD 1.0 is reached dilute the culture 1:1 with media to take an accurate OD. Then multiply the OD value by the dilution factor.
