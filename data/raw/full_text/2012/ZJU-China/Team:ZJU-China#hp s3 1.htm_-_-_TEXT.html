HP creative idea workshop
 
Actually, the idea of doing such a workshop comes from ZJU Jamboree. We saw so many inspired human practices in our Jamboree, which will make iGEM really fun. ZJU-China is eager to share all these to other iGEMers from all over the world, and present the thoughts of our SBC members to the world.
 
Some of them made pokers which have previous iGEM programs’ abstracts on each card, some even create a brand-new Card Game.
 
Let’s take a look at one of our SBC member, Yue Zhang’s idea.
