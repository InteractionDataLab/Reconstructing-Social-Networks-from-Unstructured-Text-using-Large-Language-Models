English Speech Contest
 
Critical thoughts in human practice are placed weight. ZJU-China this year collaborated with one specific English enhancing club of our university, Power of Voice (POV). We participate in their free developed speech section, and bring about three general questions concern about ethics in synthetic biology.
 
1 As a famous adage goes, scientific technique is a two-edged sword. What’s your opinion about transgene?
 
2 Synthetic Biology is to design and re-design a new biological system. Do you agree that human can create new creature in the future?
 
3 Do you think new technology like transgene will raise biosafety issues?
 
And among all the participants, there’s one student to get the first topic.
