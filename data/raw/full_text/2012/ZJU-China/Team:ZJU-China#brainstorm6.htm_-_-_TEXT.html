Radio-communication
Synthetic biology always needs bacteria to sense an input signal and output another. It occurs to us that we can use two kinds of bacteria to accomplish the task. The first one kind of bacteria senses the input signal and then fluoresces, while the second one senses the fluorescence from a distance far away from the first one and then output the final signal. It do not need a straight contact between the two kinds of bacteria, seeming like a radio-communication.
