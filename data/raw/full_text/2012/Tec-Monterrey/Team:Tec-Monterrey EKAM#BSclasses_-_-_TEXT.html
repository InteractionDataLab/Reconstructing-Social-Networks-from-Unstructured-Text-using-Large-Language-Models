Synth. Bio. High School Classes
During the January-May semester, we prepared a 1-hour introductory course to Synthetic Biology aimed to high school students. We made two versions: one for regular students with only a cursory knowledge of biology and chemistry, and another to senior students who were taking an elective class in Biotechnology.
The classes were tested in the Eugenio Garza Sada High School (PEGS), one of our university’s five high school campuses (and the one who participated in this year’s iGEM HS). All of the students were attentive and proactively asking questions. We talked about the current and future trends in synthetic biology as well about the iGEM competition and our current project.
We were invited to return for the next semester. During those classes we will also promote the iGEM High School 2013 competition and answer questions about it.
