Description
As a tool for the implementation of this construct design strategy, a software application was developed to aid in the appropriate consideration and placing of restriction sites in the master molecule, enabling a simultaneous consideration of the multiple factors affecting the efficiency of the final design. Enzyme compatibility, including digestion reaction conditions and cohesive end affinity, as well as their availability and other characteristics, are taken into account as the user points out the limits they wish to define for each module, so a future manipulation of the fragment can be carried out with as little enzyme as possible.
To aid in the generation of modular restriction sites in the master molecule. Multiple factors can be considered toward enzyme compatibility, including:
• Digestion reaction conditions
• Cohesive end affinity
• Availability
• Other characteristics
The user points out the limits they wish to define for each module, so future manipulation is possible with optimal enzyme use.
The software can be accessed here (opens in a new window).
