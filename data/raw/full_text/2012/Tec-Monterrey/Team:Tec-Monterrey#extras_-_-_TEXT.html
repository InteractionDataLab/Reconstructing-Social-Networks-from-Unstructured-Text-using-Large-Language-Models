We would like to thank everyone that helped us during these past months. Teachers, staff members, friends and family gave us support, advice and strength to continue.
We dedicate a small part of our wiki in comparison of how much they meant to us. Every kind word or small gesture, we treasure at heart.
From all Team Tec Monterrey, thank you.
Many thanks to all of our sponsors.
